REASONS FOR
reasons explain the dismissal of two applications to review the decisions made
by an appeal registrar in two related appellate
proceedings on 6 October 2025,
refusing the applicant permission to bring applications for leave to appeal out
parties to these proceedings are former de facto partners.
September 2022, with the parties’ consent, final orders were made by a
judge of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia
(Division 2) to
determine the financial cause between them under
(Cth) (“the Act”), commenced in 2020.
part, the property adjustment orders required the applicant to pay sums of money
totalling $905,000 to the respondent. The applicant
defaulted in performance of
the orders so, in May 2023, the respondent applied to enforce the orders by
selling real property.
thereafter, in June 2023, the applicant filed a fresh application seeking to
vary or set aside the final orders by alternate
reliance upon
s 90SN(1)(a)
of the Act.
applicant’s s 90SN application was listed for final hearing before the
Court in February 2024 but, by reason of the applicant’s
failure to file
supportive evidence as directed, the respondent applied to summarily dismiss the
applicant’s application. The
applicant countered by seeking an adjournment
of the hearing, but that was refused.
respondent’s summary dismissal application was entertained in February
2024, after which judgment was reserved and not then
delivered until 29 January
2025. The applicant’s s 90SN application was summarily dismissed
Svetovit & Lucila
[2025] FedCFamC2F 54).
The primary judge
relevantly made this order:
applicant’s application filed on 2 June 2023, and amended on 5 June 2023,
is dismissed.
respondent then pressed ahead with her application to enforce the final orders,
which was heard in March 2025, with judgment delivered
on 3 April 2025
Svetovit & Lucila (No 2)
[2025] FedCFamC2F 402).
Relevantly, the
applicant was ordered to give the respondent vacant possession of two parcels of
real property, in respect of which
she was appointed the trustee for sale.
later, on 28 August 2025, the applicant filed two Applications in an Appeal
seeking an extension of time within which to appeal
from both the January 2025
judgment and the April 2025 judgment.
passing, it should be noted both judgments were interlocutory in nature, so the
applicant had no absolute right of appeal and had
to seek an extension of time
within which to apply for leave to appeal, but he does not seek such leave in
his draft Notices of Appeal.
two applications were promptly heard together by the appeal registrar in
September 2025 and were dismissed by orders made on 6
October 2025 in these
the Applications in an Appeal filed 28 August 2025 in NAA409 of 2025 and NAA410
of 2025 are dismissed.
in respect of the said applications, the Application pay the Respondent’s
combined costs fixed in the sum of $3,000 within
27 October 2025, the applicant filed two Applications in an Appeal seeking to
review the appeal registrar’s decisions in
both proposed appeals.
support of his review applications, the applicant relied upon:
(a) the affidavit he filed on 28 August 2025 in support of his applications to
extend time;
(b) the written submissions he filed on 8 September 2025 in support of an
application he made to the primary judge to stay the April
2025 orders;
(c) the written submissions he filed on 9 September 2025 in support of his
applications to extend time;
(d) the affidavit he filed on 28 October 2025 (which annexes another affidavit
he filed on 10 September 2025, upon which the appeal
registrar refused him
permission to rely due to its late filing); and
(e) the affidavit he affirmed and tried to file yesterday (2 November 2025).
review process entails an original hearing of the applicant’s applications
for an extension of time within which to apply
for leave to appeal from the
January 2025 judgment and the April 2025 judgment. The applicant’s
assertions of error made by
the appeal registrar are disregarded because they
are irrelevant. The extension applications are now heard afresh.
applicant sought that the two applications be determined in the absence of the
parties in accordance with r 13.38 and
Federal Circuit and
Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021
(Cth), but the
applications were instead listed for hearing to give the applicant every
opportunity to be heard. The applicant appeared
and was assisted by a McKenzie
friend. He did not supplement the contents of his multiple affidavits and
written submissions by any
oral submissions.
respondent appeared and resisted the review applications. She relied upon the
written submissions she filed on 9 September 2025
to oppose the
applicant’s applications to extend time to appeal.
Legal principles
legal principles which govern the disposition of applications for leave to bring
an appeal (or application for leave to appeal)
out of time were expressed in
summarised form as follows in
Whitmore & Whitmore
[2022] FedCFamC1A
decisions have addressed the principles which apply to the determination of
applications to extend time to appeal. Inevitably,
they all lead back to
principles enunciated by the High Court of Australia in
Gallo v Dawson
(1990) 93 ALR 479
Jackamarra v Krakouer
(1998) 195 CLR 516.
Essentially,
the applicant seeking the extension of time must demonstrate that there is a
substantial issue to be raised in the appeal,
for otherwise it is pointless
granting the extension of time to bring it. That issue is always central to the
inquiry, though other
considerations then influence the exercise of discretion.
Such other considerations are unconfined but include the extent of the
the cogency of the reasons offered by the applicant for the delay, whether
hardship or prejudice would accrue to the respondent
if an extension of time
were granted, and the public policy of ensuring that finalised litigation is not
unnecessarily re-opened.
principles are applied.
January 2025 judgment
time for filing any Notice of Appeal from this judgment expired on 26 February
application to extend time was therefore six months late.
an overall proposition, the applicant submits this to warrant an extension of
time within which to apply for leave to appeal:
3. The Application respectfully submits that:
delay was neither lengthy nor strategic, and arose from mental health
incapacity, solicitor obstruction, and lack of access to
key documentation;
Respondent suffers no prejudice, as her entitlement under the Consent Orders
remains fixed and protected; and
Applicant would suffer irreparable prejudice if leave is refused, as the
enforcement process has led to the extinguishment of
equity of redemption,
destruction of livelihood, and ongoing insolvency risk.
(Applicant’s Written Submissions filed on 9 September 2025)
more detailed explanation of his prolonged delay, the applicant deposed this in
his affidavit filed on 28 October 2025:
Registrar treated the delay as unexplained or unjustified. I say this finding
was made in error, because three independent causes
prevented me from filing
within time:
Solicitor obstruction and mis advice
My then-solicitor [named] repeatedly discouraged me from appealing, refused to
draft or file appeal papers unless further money
was paid into trust, despite
out ongoing payment structure being pay as you go, and told me “you
can’t appeal”
immediately after I instructed him to appeal the
enforcement decision.
Active reliance on solicitor
I relied on him as my legal representative during the entire appeal window. He
had carriage of the matter and told me he would advise
if appeal rights should
be exercised. He later blamed me for being “out of time” despite
refusing to file.
health impairment
I was not psychologically capable of self-filing an appeal once my solicitor
refused to act. I suffer from PTSD, severe anxiety,
and panic attacks. I depend
heavily on assistance to manage legal processes. My partner [named] prepared all
paperwork for me. Without
her assistance I could not function. The Registrar
assumed capacity merely because there was no
medical report –
that is an error of principle.
(Emphasis in original)
moving to consider the central issue of whether there is any “substantial
issue” to be raised in the proposed appeal,
several things may be
uncontroversially observed about the applicant’s evidence and
submissions.
there is no evidence of the applicant’s mental health
“incapacity” or “impairment” at the time
of the hearing
in February 2024, which hearing was the foundation for the January 2025
applicant proffered medical reports which only attest to his mental ill-health
up until the later part of 2023. In his affidavit
filed on 28 October 2025 (at
[14]–[18] and [31]–[33]), the applicant asserts his
“functional incapacity”
did not vanish after 2023 merely because he
cannot afford to update the medical reports to verify the fact, but the fact
the “incapacity” which the applicant alleges beyond 2023 is
only the subject of his self-serving evidence.
applicant had no psychological diagnosis or treatment before August 2022, when
he first consulted a psychologist, Ms B, who concluded
he had a phobia of
confined spaces and PTSD.
July 2023, Dr C, a consultant psychiatrist reported to the applicant’s
general practitioner that he responded to questions
with appropriate answers,
there was no evidence of formal thought disorder or perceptual disturbance, and
he was well orientated
in time and place. Then in September 2023, Dr C reported
to the applicant’s then solicitors that he agreed with their assessment
that the applicant should be represented by a legal guardian.
realising the lack of probative weight carried by the reports of Dr C, the same
solicitors referred the applicant to a
forensic psychiatrist, Dr D, for another
opinion. Dr D was furnished with the reports written by Ms B and Dr C. In
October 2023,
Dr D: opined the applicant had suffered PTSD, but he had no mood
disorder; saw no evidence of “significant cognitive disturbance
disturbance in functioning”; considered the applicant had “capacity
to give instructions [to lawyers]”; and
did not believe he needed a
litigation guardian.
applicant’s assertion of his “incapacity” precluding him from
filing timely appeals seems wholly inconsistent
with three things: the tenor of
his own expert psychiatric evidence; his admitted capacity to understand the
process and actively
instruct his former lawyers, in the face of either their
wilful obstruction or negligent disinterest, to file Notices of Appeal within
time; and his evident capacity to prepare large and comprehensive documents to
prosecute both his extension and review applications
without legal
assistance.
at least objectively, the applicant’s evidence and submissions about the
delinquent professional performance of his
former lawyers seems to rise no
higher than that they lacked his confidence about the prospects of his proposed
appeals and refused
to act on his instructions unless properly paid for their
services. Without payment, they withdrew their representation of the applicant,
which response seems quite unexceptional.
the applicant’s submission of his “lack of access to key
documentation” is a bare proposition not borne
out by either his evidence
or the voluminous documents upon which he now relies in these review
applications. According to his written
submissions, the only document withheld
from the applicant was the sale contract related to one property, which has no
logical connection
with his delay in seeking leave to appeal from the January
2025 judgment.
follows that the applicant does not present a strong case to excuse the very
lengthy delay in seeking an extension of time within
which to seek leave to
appeal from the January 2025 judgment.
decision in January 2025 to summarily dismiss the s 90SN application brought by
the applicant followed from the conclusion that
it had no reasonable prospect of
success. In making that assessment, the primary judge took account of the
application (in its amended
form) and the only supporting affidavit the
applicant had filed on 2 June 2023. The reason for the summary dismissal
application
was the applicant’s failure to file and serve further and
better supportive evidence, as directed, to capably demonstrate why
September 2022 consent orders should be varied or set aside.
then to the nine proposed grounds of appeal which the applicant would prosecute
if given leave to do so, they are as follows:
1. Denial of Procedural Fairness –
Her Honour erred by refusing an adjournment, leaving the Applicant unrepresented
with minimal evidence. The refusal was based on
an unsupported finding of
tactical delay, ignoring medical evidence of incapacity and limited literacy.
[Applicant’s friend]
was permitted to speak only because the Applicant
could not conduct the hearing himself.
2. Error in Capacity Finding –
Her Honour erred in finding the Applicant had capacity to enter the 2022 Consent
Orders and conduct the s 90SN hearing, wrongly treating
legal representation as
determinative and ignoring evidence of memory loss, dissociation, coercive
control, and situational incapacity
caused by family violence and litigation
3. Failure to Consider CGT, GST and Realisation Costs –
Her Honour erred in dismissing CGT, GST and business realisation costs as
“no evidence”, despite tax advice and affidavits
showing liability
was inevitable on long-held properties and trading stock. Failure to make a
contingent order rendered the Consent
Orders unjust and inequitable.
4. Misapplication of s 90SN and Consent Orders –
Her Honour erred by treating the application as “buyer’s
remorse” and limiting review, ignoring incapacity, coercive
control, CGT,
and bargaining imbalance. Consent was wrongly treated as arms-length, despite [a
named judge] approving the orders
in chambers without inquiry.
5. Error in Default Rules and Summary Determination –
Her Honour erred by dismissing the application for procedural default and
refusing an adjournment finding deliberate non-compliance
without basis. This
forced a summary determination of the s 90SN application without proper
evidence, denying the Applicant a fair
opportunity to present his case.
6. Failure to weigh prejudice –
Her Honour erred by prioritising finality over justice and equity. She accepted
the Respondent’s claims of incapacity to work
without evidentiary basis,
despite contradictory affidavits, while overlooking the Applicant’s
catastrophic prejudice in losing
his livelihood, [business] and capacity to
service debts.
7. Excessive Judgment Delay –
Her Honour erred by delivering judgment nearly 12 months after hearing,
exceeding reasonable timeframes and causing prejudice through
mounting interest
and enforcement pressure, amounting to procedural unfairness.
8. Inconsistent Reasoning Across Judgments –
Her Honour erred with inconsistent findings between January 2025 (assumed
windfall, speculative CGT, deliberate delay) and April
2025 (no windfall,
genuine concerns, CGT crystallisation due to forced sale without refinance
9. Erroneous Inferences and Fact-Finding –
Her Honour repeatedly treated inferences as facts without supporting evidence,
and consistently drew them in the Respondent’s
(Applicant’s affidavit filed 28 September 2025, p. 109–110)
1 and 5 are misconceived as they are directed to an anterior decision to refuse
an adjournment, which does not form part of
the decision to summarily dismiss
the s 90SN application. The respondent’s summary dismissal application was
determined on
the evidence voluntarily adduced by the applicant, taken at its
highest. The applicant was given every opportunity to explain why
application should not be summarily dismissed and instead permitted to progress
to a substantive hearing, but the primary
judge found his explanation
unconvincing.
2, 3 and 4 seem hopeless. At the time of the summary hearing in February 2024,
the primary judge was obliged to treat the
September 2022 orders as being
binding and operable. The applicant was legally represented when the consent
orders were made in September
2022 and was bound by his lawyers’
representations to the Court at that time of his competent assent to the orders.
The adversarial
system of litigation proceeds upon the assumption that parties
are bound by the conduct of their legal representatives (
Patel v The
[2012] HCA 29
(2012) 247 CLR 531
TKWJ v The Queen
[2002] HCA 46
(2002) 212 CLR
and [74]). Any complaint the applicant now has about the adequacy of
his representation by those lawyers in September 2022 may be
pursued with them
directly or the professional bodies which regulate their practice (
(2006) 227 CLR 423
6, 7, 8 and 9 are not competent grounds of appeal as they do not allege
recognisable legal, factual or discretionary appealable
errors to vitiate the
January 2025 judgment.
applicant fails to demonstrate there is any “substantial issue” to
be raised in the proposed appeal from the January
2025 judgment, in which case
there is no point served by granting an extension of time within which to apply
for leave to appeal.
The applicant’s relatively weak arguments advanced to
excuse his delay fall away.
April 2025 judgment
time for filing any Notice of Appeal from this judgment expired on 1 May
application to extend time was therefore nearly four months late.
applicant’s explanation for the delay is exactly as that given in respect
of the January 2025 judgment, though one further
observation is pertinent. The
applicant’s submission of him suffering “irreparable
prejudice” if deprived of the
right to bring an application for leave to
appeal out of time from the April 2025 judgment is a bare proposition. No appeal
was brought
from the final consent orders made in September 2022. The April 2025
judgment simply enabled enforcement of the September 2022 orders,
which decision
was hardly exceptional given the applicant’s default in performance of the
orders by then had prevailed for
well over two years. Upon enforcement of those
orders, each party will receive the proportion of property they agreed to
albeit by the sale of real property which would not have been necessary
if the applicant had paid the respondent as originally agreed.
primary judge: correctly acknowledged the power of enforcement was a
discretionary exercise; acknowledged the extended period
applicant’s default; observed how the appointment of the wife as trustee
for sale of the two parcels of real property
would be a consequential and not
substantive order; and rejected the applicant’s entreaties to be given the
reprieve of several
more months to sell the two properties himself.
21 proposed grounds of appeal which the applicant would prosecute if given leave
to do so, are pleaded as follows:
Conflict of Interest – Her Honour erred in appointing the Respondent as
trustee for sale without safeguards despite
her clear conflict of interest as
both beneficiary and adversarial party, and her fixed sum payment.
in Denying Applicant Control – Her Honour erred in denying the Applicant
any role in the sale process, despite him being
the only party with any
incentive to maximise sale price, thereby stripping him of the ability to
protect his equity of redemption.
to Weigh Relative Prejudice – Her Honour erred in prioritising finality
over justice and equity, accepting the Respondent’s
hardship claims
without evidence while discounting the Applicant’s catastrophic prejudice
including loss of [business], livelihood,
and risk of bankruptcy.
Enforcement
Orders Not Mechanical – Her Honour erred in characterising the enforcement
orders as “mechanical” when
they fundamentally altered the structure
and intent of the consent orders.
Inference – Her Honour erred in inferring that the Applicant would obtain
a windfall from property value increases,
inconsistent with later acknowledgment
that enforcement would not produce a windfall.
to Provide Refinance or Staggered Sale – Her Honour erred in failing to
allow for refinance preserving the Applicant’s
equity of redemption,
staggered sale, or choice of which property was sold first, thereby excluding
less prejudicial compliance options.
to Safeguard Sale Process – Her Honour erred in failing to impose
safeguards on the sale process, including requirements
for valuation, reserve,
and Applicant involvement in timing and strategy.
to Consider CGT and Realisation Costs – Her Honour erred in failing to
consider the inevitable capital gains tax, GST,
and transaction costs arising
from forced realisation of the Applicant’s long-held assets, imposing
liabilities far in excess
of the $905,000 settlement sum.
Possession and Chattels – Her Honour erred in requiring vacant possession
and chattel removal within 14 days, causing
disproportionate prejudice and
risking loss of third-party property.
in Judgment – Her Honour erred in delaying delivery of the 90SN judgment
for 12 months, casing substantial additional
interest (over $100,000) and
compounding enforcement prejudice.
Inferences Without Evidence – Her Honour erred in consistently drawing
adverse inferences against the Applicant while
accepting the Respondent’s
assertions without evidentiary support.
Respondent’s
Contradictory Evidence – Her Honour erred in relying on the
Respondent’s uncorroborated claims of incapacity
to work and hardship
while disregarding contradictory evidence of her work capacity.
Mischaracterisation
of Caveats – Her Honour erred in mischaracterising caveats lodged by law
firms as “registered”
liabilities payable from sale proceeds,
elevating untested claims to secured debts.
Provision for Surplus Proceeds – Her Honour erred in failing to make
provision for the Applicant to receive surplus proceeds
after satisfaction of
the settlement sum and legitimate liabilities, contrary to the structure of the
consent orders.
Debt Mediation – Her Honour erred in failing to account for the
Applicant’s statutory right to [Business] Debt
Mediation with NAB before
ordering sale of cross-collateralised properties.
Status of Third-Party Chattels – Her Honour erred in failing to determine
whether third-party chattels were property
encompassed by orders 4–5,
creating risk of unjust forfeiture.
Destruction
of [Business] and Livelihood – Her Honour erred in failing to weigh the
destruction of the Applicant’s [business
stock] and contracting business,
causing irreparable loss of income and livelihood.
of Family Violence and Threats – Her Honour erred in failing to consider
the Respondent’s history of family violence
and threats to bankrupt and
destroy the Applicant when appointed her as trustee for sale.
to Distinguish Property Types – Her Honour erred in treating [Town E] (a
residential block) and [Town F] (a working
[agricultural business]) alike,
ignoring their very different nature and consequences of forced sale.
Mischaracterisation
of Delay – Her Honour erred in finding deliberate delay by the Applicant,
including in relation to chattels,
appeal timing and the 90SN application, when
delay was explained by medical evidence, solicitor withdrawal, and reliance on
advice. This error underpinned the refusal of safeguards and the harshness
of the enforcement orders.
Enrichment / Lack of Safeguards – Her Honour in enabling the Respondent,
with a fixed entitlement, to control sale proceeds
and benefit from forfeiture
of chattels and mischaracterised liabilities, contrary to equitable principles
and the Applicant’s
equity of redemption.
(Applicant’s affidavit filed 28 September 2025, p. 117–118)
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 and 21 are not competent grounds of
appeal as they do not allege recognisable
legal, factual or discretionary
appealable errors to vitiate the April 2025 judgment.
4 implicitly alleges an error of law by asserting the enforcement orders
impermissibly alter the terms of the September 2022
orders. The contention is
without merit. The enforcement orders dictate the sale of two real properties to
ensure the overall division
of property between the parties in the way envisaged
by the orders upon which they agreed in September 2022 (Order 7). The applicant
forfeited the right to control the sale of the properties by failing to do so
for more than two years.
5, to the extent it implies an error of fact, must be rejected. Any such
inference drawn by the primary judge was immaterial.
The two real properties
will be sold on the open market. Whether they realise prices greater or lesser
than their assumed values
at the time the parties struck their agreement in
September 2022 is beside the point. The applicant conducted the enforcement
in March 2025 acknowledging the two properties had to be sold, but he
wanted to instead control the sales (
Svetovit & Lucila (No 2)
[19]–[20]). The respondent, as the appointed trustee for sale, bears a
duty of fidelity to the applicant to ensure the properties
are sold for the best
prices attainable. The applicant’s personal doubts about the
respondent’s adherence to that duty
is not a premise for an appeal from
the April 2025 orders.
8 must be rejected. The distribution of the proceeds realised on the sale of the
two real properties is governed by the terms
of the September 2022 orders
(Orders 7(c) and 7(d)). Those orders make no provision for the payment of any
capital gains tax attracted
by the sales and in fact require the parties to
indemnify one another against liabilities they incur (Order 13), so the
enforcement
orders made by the primary judge in April 2025 certainly could not
make contradictory provision. The enforcement orders could not
and do not alter
the parties’ substantive rights.
11, so far as it comprises a complaint of the primary judge’s acceptance
of the respondent’s evidence, is without
merit. To the extent of any
inconsistency in the evidence adduced by the parties at the hearing, the primary
judge was entitled to
prefer the evidence given by one party over the other.
Factual findings based upon the acceptance of one party’s uncorroborated
evidence are immune to challenge unless shown to be “glaringly
improbable” or irreconcilable with other incontrovertible
(2003) 214 CLR 118
at [26]–[31] and [65]–[93];
Helicopter Co Inc v McDermott
[2016] HCA 22
(2016) 331 ALR 550
[2019] HCA 28
(2019) 266 CLR 129
12 must fail, even if the applicant could show the respondent’s evidence
improbable or contrary to other
incontrovertible evidence, because any finding made about her capacity for work
was immaterial to
the enforcement decision. The applicant owed the respondent
$900,000 (plus interest) under the September 2022 orders. The sale of
real properties was the only way in which the orders could be enforced, whether
the respondent has the capacity for work
18, which presumably amounts to a complaint of discretionary error by the
primary judge’s failure to take the respondent’s
alleged history of
past violent behaviour into account, verges on being preposterous. It assumes
his allegations of the respondent’s
violent and threatening behaviour are
proven facts when they were not. Neither party was cross-examined at the hearing
in March 2025.
Furthermore, any such conduct alleged by the applicant against
the respondent prior to their agreement in September 2022 must have
factored into his decision to settle the dispute at that time.
20, in so far as it alleges the primary judge fell into error by finding the
applicant had deliberately delayed his performance
of the September 2022 orders,
is without merit. The applicant was certainly in default of the final orders for
well over two years.
It did not matter whether his delay was deliberate or
inadvertent. Uncontroversially, he had been unable to sell the two real
for more than two years. The only feasible option was to appoint the
respondent instead of the applicant as trustee for sale to expedite
applicant fails to demonstrate there is any “substantial issue” to
be raised in the proposed appeal from the April
2025 judgment, in which case
there is no point served by granting an extension of time within which to apply
for leave to appeal.
Again, the applicant’s relatively weak arguments
advanced to excuse his delay fall away.
