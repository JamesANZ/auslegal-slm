LIQUOR LICENSING ACT, 1997
ORDER OF THE LIQUOR
AND GAMBLING COMMISSIONER
Application No:
97094 & 97095
Licence No:
FAMILY HOTEL BAR & GRILL
134 ELLEN STREET
HEQET PTY LTD
Effective Date:
23 September 2009
SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER
This is a review of interim approvals contained in Order numbered 135772 made
by me on 22 April 2009:
“This is an application by HEQET PTY LTD the holder of a HOTEL
LICENCE under the
Liquor Licensing Act, 1997
for VARIATION TO EXTENDED TRADING
AUTHORISATION & VARIATION TO ENTERTAINMENT CONSENT, in respect of premises
situated at 134
ELLEN STREET, PORT PIRIE 5540 and known as FAMILY HOTEL BAR
& GRILL. Under
(3) (a) of the Act, I modify the advertising
requirements.
I am satisfied as to the requirements of
(2) of the Act and I
vary the extended trading authorisation to include the following: AREAS 5 to
FRIDAY & SATURDAY - midnight to 4.00AM the following day
section 105
of the Act, entertainment may be provided on the
following parts of the licensed premises or appurtenant areas as delimited in
on the plans lodged with the application: AREAS 1 & 5
The above approvals are granted on an interim basis only with a 12 month
period of review at the discretion of the Liquor and Gambling
Commissioner.
I impose the following condition on the licence:
emissions from the premises shall not be at levels that are likely to disturb
any nearby occupiers of premises.”
Notwithstanding there having been no objections or interventions
lodged in respect of the application, I nevertheless held some concerns
use of the external Areas 5 to 7 and consequently granted the approvals only on
basis with a 12 month period of review
discretion of the Liquor and Gambling Commissioner”
Having become aware of concerns in respect of the operation of the licensed
premises, I subsequently initiated a review of the
approvals for
review before me under Order numbered 137212 which I reproduce:
“I refer to previous Order numbered 135772 and having become aware
of issues concerning the operations of the licensed premises,
I now intend to
review the interim approvals which may result in the interim approvals being
revoked or modified.
The identified issues include:
- Loud and intrusive music emanating from the licensed premises,
particularly from Area 5.
- The suitability of Areas 5, 6 and 7 for the use as an outdoor
entertainment area.
- Management and supervision issues in relation to minors being on the
premises at prohibited times, and patrons urinating other
- Inadequate and/or ineffective security tasked to monitor the licensed
premises and particularly Areas 5, 6 & 7.
I set down the interim approvals review before me on Monday 17 August 2009
at 10 am at this Office.”
Subsequent to my setting down the
approvals for review, the
Commissioner of Police lodged a Notice of Intervention to the review on 17
August 2009 stating:
“that the purpose of the intervention was to
introduce evidence or make representations on any question before the Liquor and
Gambling Commissioner, and in particular whether the interim approval should be
revoked or modified.”
During the review conducted at this Office on 17 August 2009 with the
participation of the licensee and police, it became abundantly
clear to me that
serious problems were discovered by Police Licensing Enforcement Branch officers
on 26 July 2009 at approximately
2.30am with ineffective security, minors on
premises, overflowing external portable toilets, poor lighting, overcrowding in
the external
rear areas, patrons urinating in an alleyway.
During the review process, the Commissioner asserted that the relevant
external areas are not suitable for their current use by the
licensee and
consequently the
approvals should not be permitted to
I record that attempts to resolve the parties’ differences, were
unsuccessful and note that the licensee has not contested the
standing of the
Commissioner of Police to lodge the Notice of Intervention (albeit only on 22
September 2009).
On behalf of the licensee, it is submitted that, conciliation having failed,
I am bound to refer the review of
approvals to the Court as
required under
section 17(1)(b)(ii)
of the Act and having regard to the
principles of procedural fairness.
Clearly this is an unusual matter in that the
approvals were
not made as a result of a conciliated outcome, however, expressly as a
safeguard to
“test the waters”
and with an ability to revisit
the approvals should the need arise.
Whilst I find that the licensee has subsequently instituted initiatives, in
endeavour to address detected problems, police still hold
concerns in relation
to the operation of those areas under the
These issues will undoubtedly need to be fully ventilated at a future
I find that there is no presumption in favour of the
continuing in that the approvals were expressly granted
“with strings
and can clearly be distinguished from an ongoing approval,
which can only be interfered with by way of disciplinary action, a complaint
section 106
or imposition of conditions under
of the Act, or
other express provision of the Act.
Having regard to all matters before me and under
section 53(1)
of the Act I
approvals until further Order and I impose the
conditions on the licence also until further Order:
On Friday and
Saturday nights the licensee shall provide the following number of approved
crowd controllers at the licensed premises:
From 9pm there shall be not less
than 2 approved crowd controllers and from midnight, one additional approved
crowd controller to
monitor the licensed premises and adjacent areas until 30
minutes following cessation of trade, or until all patrons have departed
the licensed premises and adjacent areas.
which I impose to ensure there is adequate security at the licensed
On Friday and
Saturday nights a lockout shall apply from 1.30am.
which I impose having found that the vast majority of patrons
resort to these licensed premises from other licensed premises or parties
this is of concern both to the Commissioner of Police and this Office.
I otherwise refer the review of
approvals and conditions to
the Licensing Court under
section 21(c)
of the Act.
