Pay-roll Tax Employment Agency contracts - Chain of on-hire (PT-112) [2004] VICSROPT 7 (1 December 2004)
The "dashed" arrows indicate the second employment
agency contract arrangement � i.e. Agent 2 has procured
Agent 1 for their client, Business 1.
7. This Revenue Ruling addresses the Pay-roll Tax
implications of situations where an employment agent
hires labour to another employment agent where the
second agent then further on-hires that labour to their
8. Under the arrangement shown in Example 1, Business 1
would make a payment to Agent 2. Agent 2 would make
a payment down the line to Agent 1. Agent 1 would then
make a payment to the Service Provider. The purpose of
this Revenue Ruling is to clarify which of these payments
are subject to Pay-roll Tax under the employment agency
contract provisions.
9. When an employment agency contract arises, section
5(1)(6)(b) of the Act deems the employment agency to
be the employer of the person performing the work for
the client. Furthermore, "wages" paid by the
employment agent to the service provider are deemed to
be taxable wages paid by the agent. In Example 1 this
would mean that Agent 2 has paid taxable "wages" to
Agent 1 and that Agent 1 has paid taxable "wages" to
Service Provider.
This scenario is illustrated in Example 2 below.
10. The Commissioner of State Revenue (the
Commissioner) has ruled that in situations where there
is a "chain of on-hire" the agent closest to the ultimate
client is the agent that is liable for Pay-roll Tax. In
Example 2, Agent 2 would pay Pay-roll Tax on the $75
paid to Agent 1.
State Taxation Acts (Tax Reform) Act 2004
introduced amendments to the employment agency
contracts provisions contained within the
Pay-roll Tax Act
(the Act) with effect from 1 January 2005.
2. Prior to these amendments Pay-roll Tax was imposed on
employment agency contracts under the provisions of
section 3D of the Act with the client of the employment
agency incurring a Pay-roll Tax liability on 75 per cent of
the amount paid by the client, excluding GST, to the
3. The amended provisions are contained in Part II of the
Act and have the effect of shifting the Pay-roll Tax
liability under an employment agency contract from the
client of the agent to the agent directly.
4. An employment agency contract is defined in section
4(1) of the Act as follows:
For the purposes of this Act, an "employment agency
contract" is a contract, whether formal or informal and
whether express or implied, under which a person
("employment agent") procures the services of another
person ("service provider") for a client of the
employment agent.
5. These provisions apply to labour-hire arrangements
where the client contracts with another person
(employment agent) for the provision of labour where
there is no contract or agreement between the worker
and the client.
The diagram below depicts a common employment agency
contract arrangement.
6. In some instances, multiple employment agency
contracts may arise. This could be when one
employment agent on-hires a service provider to another
employment agent who then on-hires the original service
provider to their client.
This scenario is illustrated in Example 1 below.
The "solid" arrows indicate the first employment agency
contract arrangement - i.e. Agent 1 has procured Service
Provider for their client, Agent 2.

What if Agent 2 is not liable for Pay-roll Tax?
11. If, for some reason Agent 2 does not have a Pay-roll
Tax liability (because it pays total wages below the
taxable threshold) then Pay-roll Tax on the
arrangement shown in Example 2 will be payable by
Agent 1 on the $50 paid to Service Provider
12. In order for Agent 1 and Agent 2 to know exactly what
their respective Pay-roll Tax obligations will be (and to
overcome situations where both Agent 1 and Agent 2
pay Pay-roll Tax on essentially the same employment
agency contract arrangement), Agent 1 should require
Agent 2 to complete SRO Pay-roll Tax Form 10
(Employment Agency Contracts � Chain of on-hire
declaration) which is available on
www.sro.vic.gov.au
In completing SRO Pay-roll Tax Form 10, Agent 2 will
confirm either:
they are not liable for Pay-roll Tax; or
they are liable for Pay-roll Tax and will pay Pay-roll Tax
on the "wages" paid to Agent 1
13. If this declaration is completed and Agent 2 has
indicated that they are not liable for Pay-roll Tax, Agent
1 should ensure that Pay-roll Tax is paid on the
payment they make to the Service Provider.
14. If Agent 2 has declared they are liable for, and will pay,
Pay-roll Tax on the arrangement, the Commissioner will
excuse Agent 1 from their liability on the payment
made by Agent 1 to the Service Provider.
What if Agent 2 has declared incorrectly?
15. If Agent 2 has declared to Agent 1 that they are liable
and will meet the Pay-roll Tax obligation under the
employment agency contract, and it is found that the
declaration has been made in error, the Commissioner
will excuse Agent 1 from any retrospective liability
when satisfied that:
the incorrect declaration was an honest mistake; and
the incorrect declaration was not made in an attempt
to reduce or avoid Pay-roll Tax liability.
However, in these circumstances the Commissioner will
generally assess Agent 2 for any arrears of Pay-roll Tax
that may arise.
16. If the Commissioner believes that the incorrect
declaration was made for the purposes of reducing or
avoiding Pay-roll Tax liability, then the Commissioner
may, under the provisions of section 5A of the Act,
choose to impose the Pay-roll Tax liability upon either
Agent 1 or Agent 2.
