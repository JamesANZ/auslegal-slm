Dickson v Hassum & Levitt Pty Ltd & Anor [2024] HCASL 316 (5 December 2024)
HASSUM & LEVITT PTY LTD
[2024] HCASL 316
applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of
the Supreme Court of Queensland
(Mullins P, Boddice JA and Applegarth J), dismissing an appeal from a judgment
of the Supreme Court
of Queensland (Muir J).
application does not raise any appropriate question of law or principle for this
Court to consider and there is insufficient
reason to doubt the correctness of
the Court of Appeal's judgment. It would therefore be futile to grant the
extension of time sought.
leave to appeal is refused.
