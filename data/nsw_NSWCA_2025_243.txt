a notice of motion filed on 17 October 2025, the respondent seeks security for
his costs of the appeal in the amount of $40,000
pursuant to
Uniform Civil
Procedure Rules 2005
r 51.50(1).
her will, the late Finikou Theocharous left her residual estate consisting
largely of the family home to be divided equally between
her five children
including the appellant. The value of the residual estate was $1,360,496.72.
That amount does not include legal
costs paid by the estate or amounts that it
is or might be entitled to recover from the appellant.
the appellant’s divorce, the appellant lived with his mother in the family
when his mother moved into a nursing
tiler, but he
was largely dependent on unemployment benefits and later a
carer’s pension. He now receives a disability pension. He has a
problem which appears to have consumed what money he had.
appellant refused to move out of the home following his mother’s death.
Ultimately, an order for possession was made in
favour of one of the
appellant’s brothers as executor of the estate so the house could be sold:
Theocharous v Theocharous
[2025] NSWSC 45.
The appellant was ordered
to pay the executor’s costs of those proceedings. The appellant currently
has no permanent residence.
separate proceedings, the appellant made an application for provision under
Chapter 3 of the
Succession Act 2006
(NSW). That application was
dismissed by Parker J: see
Theocharous v Theocharous (No 2)
[2025] NSWSC
). In addition, his Honour made an order that the appellant
reimburse the estate in the amount of $42,544. That liability arose from
that the deceased had made to a local real estate agent, which the appellant had
purportedly collected on the estate’s
behalf but had not paid to the
into account an offer of compromise, his Honour also ordered that the appellant
pay the estate’s costs on the ordinary
basis up until 8 July 2024 and on
an indemnity basis from 9 July 2024.
a result of those orders, the respondents’ solicitor, Mr Angelo
Andresakis, estimates that the appellant owes the deceased
estate an amount of
$314,920 made up of the following amounts:
(a) An amount of $54,920 being the amount the appellant owed his mother plus
post judgment interest;
(b) $60,000 pursuant to costs orders in the possession proceedings (which are
not the subject of appeal); and
(c) $200,000 pursuant to the costs orders in the family provision proceedings
(which are the subject of appeal).
result is that, absent a successful appeal, the amount the appellant owes the
estate exceeds the amount of his bequest.
notice of appeal identifies six grounds of appeal. Two relate to what is said to
have been a misapplication by the trial judge
of the rule in
(1893) 6 R 67, although those grounds of appeal do identify how the
rule was misapplied. Two grounds relate to factual findings made
by the trial
judge. One concerns the extent to which the appellant made improvements to the
family home while living there. The primary
judge ultimately concluded at
J2[147] that it was not possible to make definitive findings about the degree of
work undertaken by
the appellant, although his Honour expressed scepticism about
the appellant’s claimed financial contribution. The other concerns
finding by the primary judge that the deceased promised the appellant that he
would have a life tenure at the family home as “highly
implausible”
(J2[163]). A fifth ground is that “the learned trial judge erred in law in
the application of the test under
Succession Act 2006
(NSW)”. The sixth relates to the order for indemnity
Relevant principles
r 51.50(1) gives the Court power to order security for costs of an appeal
in “special circumstances”. The relevant
principles relating to an
order for security under UCPR r 51.50(1) were summarised in these terms by
Basten JA (with whom Ipp JA
and Hoeben J agreed) in
Preston v Harbour Pacific
Underwriting Management Pty Ltd
[2007] NSWCA 247
“(1) no order for security should be made in the absence
of ‘special circumstances’;
(2) consideration of what may constitute special circumstances
should not be fettered by some general rule of practice;
(3) impecuniosity, without more, will usually be
insufficient;
(4) an order may be appropriate if the appeal is shown to be
hopeless, unreasonable or of an harassing nature;
(5) where a bona fide and reasonably arguable appeal would be
stifled by an order for security, such an order should usually not
(6) the subject matter of the appeal, including an issue as to
the liberty of the individual, or a public interest may provide
a reason for not
imposing a security order which would stifle the continuation of the
comments of Emmett J in
Dye v Commonwealth Securities Limited
are also relevant. There his Honour said:
“While impecuniosity ought not to be a bar to a person prosecuting a
reasonable claim at first instance, the position on appeal
is fundamentally
different. At the appellate level, there has already been a determination
adverse to the person against whom security
for costs is sought. If there is a
substantial risk that, if successful, the respondent will be deprived of costs,
that outcome would
clearly be unjust. In a sense, it is giving to a person who
has been on the receiving end of an adverse determination by the courts,
hit at great cost to the other party in the appeal proceeding. It is against
those principles that I shall consider the matters
addressed by the
Consideration
this matter, the appellant does not take issue with the quantum of the security
sought. However, he submits that security should
be refused because if it is
ordered, it is likely to stifle the appeal. The respondent takes issue with that
contention. He submits
that the appellant failed to establish that other family
members who have provided the appellant with assistance in the past, for
example, would be unwilling to fund the appeal. He also submits that unless
security is ordered the estate will not be able to recover
its costs of the
appeal if it is successful because the appellant’s bequest has already
been exhausted, with the result that
other beneficiaries will, in effect, have
to bear the costs of the appeal.
have concluded that this is an appropriate case in which to order security.
Although it is neither possible nor appropriate for
the Court to embark on a
detailed consideration of the appellant's prospects of success on appeal, it
seems to me that on the face
of the notice of appeal and the primary
judge’s judgment, they appear to be weak. The only grounds that are
clearly identified
are the two grounds concerning factual findings. But one of
those factual findings does not appear to have been critical to his
conclusions. Both factual findings depended in part on the
benefits the primary judge had in observing the appellant give evidence.
Moreover, the primary judge gave detailed reasons for rejecting the
appellant’s evidence which on their face seem compelling.
evidence establishes that the appellant will not be able to pay any costs order
against him. Moreover, those costs will in effect
have to be borne by the other
beneficiaries. The evidence before the primary judge was that at least one of
those was also in difficult
financial circumstances, although not as extreme as
those of the appellant. In this respect the comments of Emmett J in
appear to be particularly apposite.
it is relevant to observe that the appellant’s financial position has in
part at least been brought about by his own
conduct in resisting the order for
possession, with the consequence that the other beneficiaries were denied any
part of their inheritance
and, in effect, misappropriating and dissipating money
that belonged to the estate.
those matters together, in my opinion, they establish special circumstances in
this case. I accept that the result of ordering
security may be to stifle the
appeal. Normally, that would be a compelling reason for refusing security. But
in this case, that consideration
is outweighed by the considerations that favour
an order for security.
respondent suggested that security could be ordered in tranches. However, I do
not favour that approach. The amount of security
is not great. If the true
position is that the appellant is unable to raise security, it is in the
interests of both parties that
that fact is known sooner rather than later.
Accordingly,
the orders of the Court are:
(1) The appellant provide security for the respondent’s costs of the
appeal in the sum of $40,000;
(2) The security in order (1) be provided within 28 days either by payment of
the amount into Court or by the provision of a bank
guarantee that is acceptable
to the respondent;
(3) If the appellant fails to comply with orders (1) and (2), the proceedings
against the respondent be stayed until such time as
the security is provided;
(4) If after a further 28 days, the appellant fails to provide the security
referred to in orders (1) and (2), the appeal be dismissed;
(5) The appellant pay the respondent’s costs of the notice of motion filed
on 17 October 2025.
