Disclosure of personal information in a public register [2006] NSWPrivCmr 1 (1 July 2006)
Disclosure of personal information in a public
A NSW public sector agency that administers a public register received a
complaint from an individual (D), who was concerned that
their personal
information was being disclosed on the register.
D received a letter from the agency informing D that information pertaining
to D would be available on the public register and would
be published on the
internet. The agency proposed that the register would (amongst other things)
contain D's name, sex, suburb and
qualifications (this was usual practice). In
D's case the register would also include certain other personal information that
agency believed it was legally obliged to put on the register.
D made an application under
Health Records and
Information Privacy Act 2002
(HRIPA) to the agency for an internal review. D
complained that D’s health information would be disclosed to the public if
agency included the proposed extra information on the public register. In
the application, D asked that the agency change its practice
of making this sort
of extra information available to the public.
In their findings the agency found that the information it was including on
the public register did not amount to health information,
as defined under
of the HRIPA.
For completeness, the agency also considered the application from the
perspective that the information was health information. The
agency considered
Health Privacy Principles (HPPs) 5,10 and 11. HPP 5 governs the way a person's
health information should be stored
by an organisation. It must be held securely
and not longer than is necessary. HPP 10 limits an organisation's use of health
information. HPP 11 limits an organisation's ability to disclose health
information.
In its findings, the agency referred to
Personal Information Protection Act 1998
(PPIPA). This section gives an
agency that is responsible for a public register the ability to disclose
personal information in the
register, if it is for a purpose relating to the
register or the legislation under which the register was created. In this case,
the agency was of the view that the register had been set up under legislation
that required the agency to disclose the extra information
in question.
The agency ultimately found that it did not breach D's privacy and was not
prepared to alter its practices. The agency took the view
that the public
register operated lawfully and that it complied with relevant legislation.
