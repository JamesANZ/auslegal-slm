people out to support wildlife recovery and wildlife
restoration type
activities. Additionally, we have ranger support or ranger care. This is about
working hand in hand with rangers
on particular initiatives where EPSDD and our
staff have identified particular projects where we need a bit of extra volunteer
to deliver that sort of
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government continue to develop the Parkcare program to enable community
participation in management
of nature reserves.
4.15 Heritage ACT is responsible for the heritage provisions of the

kids and the young
Recommendation
The Committee acknowledges the ACT

following topics with the Commissioner:
 Review of the ACT Plastic Shopping Bag
 Commissioner-initiated
investigations;
 Complaint-generated
investigations;
 Environmental footprint for the
 Contracts for graphic design
Plastic Bag Ban
4.21 The Committee discussed the Commissioner’s report
‘Unfantastic Plastic: Review of the ACT Plastic Shopping Bag Ban’
published in August 2018. The Commissioner made four recommendations: for a
mandatory plastic bag disclosure regime; introduction
of a minimum price for

and community paths and
the streetlight network. It also manages the city’s open space, parks and
neighbourhood play areas.
5.3 TCCS manages several ACT Government businesses (Capital Linen Service,
ACT NoWaste and Yarralumla Nursery) and provides administrative

section of the TCCS
annual report relating to Sportsgrounds.
5.5 The Committee held a public hearing with Ms Meegan Fitzharris, Minister
for Transport, and Mr Chris Steel, Minister for City Services,
on 15 November
2018 to examine the remaining areas of the TCCS annual report.
City Services
5.6 During the hearings on 13 and 15 November 2018 the Committee discussed
the following topics related to city services:
 Waste dumping
 Waste to energy
 Green bins
 Recycling of food and organic
 Plastic bag ban;
 Development of new sporting
facilities;
 Decommissioned
 Sportsgrounds;
 Playgrounds;
 Dog control
 Gross pollutant traps in
 Fix My Street
 Abandoned vehicles;
 Street trees.
Waste and Recycling
5.7 During hearings the Committee discussed the green bins program, recycling
of household food and organic waste, waste to energy
policy, and a waste dumping
5.8 The Committee asked for an update on the rollout of the green bins
program, and was told that the take-up rate is about 50 per
cent in the suburbs
where they are currently available, and ACT Government intends to extend the
program to all suburbs in Canberra
5.9 The Minister informed the Committee that it will investigate the
feasibility of a program to recycle household food and organic
waste over a five
year time frame.
5.10 The Committee heard that ACT Government is currently consulting with the
community on the development of a waste to energy
‘We want to hear from the community about the range of different waste to
energy technologies that exist and whether they have
a future in the ACT. On the
one hand that goes from things like burning of waste and waste incineration
right through to other technologies
which do not necessarily involve any burning
or heating at all, like anaerobic digestion technology, which is effectively an
composting.’
5.11 Officials
informed the Committee that it is investigating the possibility of establishing
a waste dumping levy:
‘Waste levies are generally considered in better practice jurisdictions,
both in Australia and internationally, to be a key
policy instrument which
complements a range of others. If we start from the point of view that
landfilling is cheap, therefore waste
will tend to go to the cheapest solution.
Landfilling generally and gate fees do not reflect the sorts of adverse
externalities of
landfilling, including environmental and other impacts. So
The idea is that it creates an incentive, first of all, for waste generators to
look for an alternative solution. For example, when
you take the combination of
a gate fee and a landfill levy, in New South Wales in the metropolitan region
the landfill levy on commercial
waste is about $150 a tonne. If you took a gate
fee of about $100 a tonne plus that, you are looking at $250 a tonne to landfill
waste. Therefore, a whole bunch of recycling solutions become cost effective at
under about $250 a
Committee Comment
5.12 The Committee welcomes the statement made during the hearing that ACT
Government is on track to complete the rollout of the green
bins programs to all
suburbs by June 2019.
Recommendation 5
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government continue to investigate the feasibility of recycling of household
food and organic
Recommendation 6
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government continue to investigate the feasibility of composting and anaerobic
digestion, in
order to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.
Recommendation 7
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government report to the Assembly on the outcome of the current investigation
into a possible
landfill levy.
Dog control offences
5.16 The Committee received information about the range of dog control
offences existing under Territory legislation. On notice,
the Minister provided
the Committee with the number of infringement notices issued since mid 2017:
‘Between 1 July 2017 to 21 November 2018, Domestic Animal Services (DAS)
has issued 49 Infringement Notices, totalling $7,950,
for offences relevant to
section 44 (Dogs in public places must be controlled) of the
Domestic Animals
. A further 101 Warning Notices have also been issued during the
same period for the same
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government report publicly on the incidence of dog control offences and the
number and nature
of infringements issued each year.
Fix My Street website
5.18 Officials informed the Committee of an ongoing joint project between
Access Canberra and TCCS to automate jobs logged via the
Fix My Street website,
so that residents using the website receive an automatic response explaining the
action taken in response
to their message. When asked how long this will take
to implement, officials took the question on notice, but in response the ACT
Government was not able to commit to a
Recommendation 9
The Committee recommends that Transport
Canberra and City Services continue to work with Access Canberra to improve the
Fix My Street
website, including giving people the capability to track the
progress of their case via the website.
Roads and infrastructure
5.20 During the hearing on 15 November 2018 the Committee discussed the
following topics related to roads and infrastructure:
 Kangaroo fencing on Tuggeranong
resurfacing;
 Roadworks on Gundaroo
 Roadworks on Coppins Crossing Road, and the intersection of William
Hovell Drive and John Gorton
 Maintenance and upgrade of stormwater
infrastructure;
 Streetlights.
Stormwater infrastructure
5.21 The Committee discussed the damage to infrastructure following the storm
and flooding event in February 2018. Officials informed
the Committee that a
cross-agency stormwater task force met for the first time in October 2018, and
TCCS is considering options to
prevent similar damage occurring in
‘In terms of your question around preventative work to avoid those sorts
of things in the future, the stormwater system to
manage those sorts of flows
requires significant enhancement or upstream catchment and storage-type
responses to help manage those
flows, which obviously brings with it significant
investment. We have been doing some planning work recently, separate to the
force within TCCS, to understand where those opportunities exist. We will
be presenting those to government for consideration in
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government report to the Assembly on lessons learned from the storm and flooding
event of February
2018 and actions taken to prevent future flooding
Transport Canberra
5.23 During the hearing on 15 November 2018 the Committee discussed the
following topics related to transport:
 Redesign of the bus
 Patronage on bus
 Construction of light rail stage
 New Transport Canberra ticketing
 Planning for light rail stage
 Trial of electric
 Flexible transport options for older people and people with a
disability;
 Pilot of dockless bike share
 Consultation with disability reference
 School crossing supervisor
 Transport Journey
Bus Network
Bus patronage
5.24 During hearings the Committee discussed patronage on the current bus
network, and the redesign of the bus network.
5.25 Officials informed the Committee that there is growth in patronage on
the bus network, with around 18.9 million boardings in
5.26 When asked about data on buses running full in peak periods and
bypassing passengers, officials stated that the numbers are recorded
anecdotally:
‘We get driver feedback. It is difficult for us to accurately count how
many we have missed because the way that we count the
passengers is when they
swipe with their MyWay card. But certainly from the driver feedback in peak
times that is an issue that we
are trying to
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government develop the means to capture and record data on buses running full in
peak times,
requiring them to bypass waiting passengers at bus stops.
Increased bus transfers in the new network
5.28 The Committee asked what modelling has been done to examine the effect
of increased transfers in the new bus network, and the
impact this will have on
patronage, and was told:
‘There has been work which has been undertaken by our advisers across all
aspects of the new
5.29 Officials
presented the view that the impact of increased transfers will be mitigated by
higher frequency in bus services:
‘the public transport trade-off is that, by having an interchange and
having much more frequency coming through those interchanges,
you are limiting
the amount of time that somebody has spent waiting at that interchange for the
next bus to come along. It is a balance,
but we think the need for some people
to interchange will be outweighed by the increased frequency that we have put
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government publish data on the percentage of journeys in the new bus network
that require transfer
at interchanges.
5.31 The Committee asked about the completion of construction of Light Rail
Stage 1, including the impact on businesses along the
route. The Minister
referred to the recent impact study conducted by ACT Government:
‘There were some really useful lessons that we learned out of that. We
will continue to implement those through Transport Canberra
and share them right
across government in terms of different parts of government undertaking major
public sector infrastructure investments
that impact on businesses. Canberra
Metro shared that very
asked for an update on progress of the light rail stop in Mitchell, officials
informed the Committee that TCCS is in discussions
with Canberra Metro on the
‘There are two main elements to it. One is constructing the stop itself.
Because you are adding another stop into the system,
it changes some of the
operating patterns, in which case we need to think about our light rail vehicle
numbers and what it means
for the overall system. The ball is presently in
Canberra Metro’s court to provide us with a proposal that we can take
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government publish a schedule for the construction of a light rail stop in
Flexible Transport Options
5.34 The Committee asked about flexible transport options for older people
and people with disability. Officials referred to the
flexible bus service,
while acknowledging its limitations:
‘The flexible bus service is great. We are really proud of it, but we will
also admit that it is not quite as demand responsive
as we would like if you
have to phone up a couple of days in advance and make a booking. We acknowledge
5.35 Officials
outlined an intention to explore demand-responsive bus services for places such
as the Alexander Maconochie Centre
‘In the near future we are going to take the next step in that process,
which is running a procurement process to test the
market for the smarts that
will help us deliver a better system which can be applied not only to those
demand-responsive services
that we want in our ordinary network service but also
to the flexible transport network. There are increasingly examples of these
sorts of services around the world, and there are a number being trialled in
Australia at present. There can be some nuances between
them. Some of them can
be a system where a taxi turns up and takes you wherever you want to go; some of
them can be where we run
a shuttle on a reasonably fixed route and the way the
system works is that it will deviate from that. Then there are other systems
that just plan the routes dynamically. We are keeping an open mind as to what
exactly the best way of doing that is. But the end
result is that we already
have a fleet of small buses that we use as part of the flexible transport
system. We obviously have drivers
there to go. The bit that we do not yet have
is a booking system which can bring down the advance booking required from days
to minutes.
We are on that process, and fingers crossed that we get the right
result out of that. Then we can apply that to the flexible transport
network and
it will benefit our community members who use that
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government continue to explore flexible transport options for older people, and
people with
disability who may have difficulty accessing the public transport
Recommendation 15
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government provide on-demand bus services to the Alexander Maconochie Centre to
encourage visitation
and assist detainees to maintain links with the
Dockless Bike Share Scheme
5.38 When asked for an update on the pilot of the dockless bike share scheme,
officials informed the Committee that:
‘there are some really encouraging results. It kicked off on 31 July. We
have now had over 5,000 hirings and 4½ thousand
accounts have been
Recommendation
The Committee recommends that the ACT
Government report to the Assembly on the outcomes of the Airbike dockless bike
share trial,
including overall patronage, key hotspots for beginning and end of
rides, instances of bikes being left in inappropriate places,
and instances of
bikes being retrieved from waterways.

manages and operates three public cemeteries at Gungahlin, Woden and
5.41 During the hearing on 15 November 2018 the Committee discussed the
following topics relating to the Authority:

 Internment of
