evidence traversed a number of matters that I do not consider to be particularly
germane to the jurisdictional objection. I consider
the following to be the most
pertinent factual context.
Ms Verheyen
commenced employment with North Homes on 16 August 2021 in the role of Customer
Care and Workflow Manager. In January
2023 she was promoted to the position of
General Manager – Operations (“Position”).
the time she was appointed to the Position, North Homes operated a “Co
GM” model. That is, it had two general managers.
Ms Verheyen was one;
the other was Daniel Holmes, the General Manager – Construction.
Mr Panabig,
Mr Dionysatos and Ms Feng comprised the “executive board”
of North Homes (“Executive Board”).
early 2025, the Executive Board began to have concerns with the Co GM model.
It commenced a review of the arrangement. It explored
the possibility of
dispensing with the Co GM model and appointing a sole general manager, or, in
the alternative, what changes might
need to be made to address the Executive
Board’s concerns.
Ms Verheyen
was made aware that the Executive Board was reviewing the Co GM structure and
considering appointing a sole general manager.
On 15 April 2025, she sent an
email to the Executive Board setting out her views. In summary, she supported
the maintenance of the
Co GM model, subject to certain changes to make it more
effective and efficient.
Executive Board ultimately resolved to dispense with the Co GM model and to
appoint Mr Holmes as the sole General Manager.
23 April 2025 the Executive Board met with Ms Verheyen. Mr Alkan was
also present. During the meeting, Ms Verheyen was informed
of the Executive
Board’s decision. She was also informed that North Homes would seek to
redeploy her into a sales and marketing
role on her current remuneration or,
should she not wish to be redeployed, negotiate a redundancy package with

May 2025 Ms Verheyen sent a letter to the Executive
In her letter,
Ms Verheyen referred to “the offer of [her] demotion to lead Sales
& Marketing in North Homes, reporting
to Dan Holmes”. She stated that
after carefully considering the role, she felt unable to accept it. She set out
at considerable
length the reasons why she had come to that view. She stated
that she “would like to hear the oﬀer of redundancy payment
you suggested would be an alternative”.
14 May 2025 Mr Panabig sent an email to Ms Verheyen providing a draft
redundancy package for her review.
16 May 2025 Ms Verheyen sent an email to Mr Panabig. She stated that
she had sought legal advice and had asked her lawyers to communicate

then had in her possession.

“We write to acknowledge receipt of the North Holmes vehicle, laptop

10 July 2025 DINA Lawyers sent a letter to Ms Feng, which stated in
“For the avoidance of doubt, our client has not resigned from her
employment. The return of company property on 7 July 2025
was undertaken as a
practical and professional step, consistent with her obligations, and to
minimise further distress.
Any suggestion that the return of property constitutes a resignation is
expressly rejected. If your organisation intends to treat
the return of property
as a resignation, please confirm that position in writing, including the legal
and factual basis for such
a characterisation. Should any steps be taken to
finalise the employment relationship on that basis, our client reserves the
to seek urgent interlocutory relief with at further notice.”
14 July 2025 North Homes sent a letter to DINA Lawyers, which stated in
“We acknowledge the prior uncertainty following Sarah’s voluntary
return of company property. At the time, this was reasonably
interpreted by the
company as an indication of resignation.
Following your clarification that this was not Sarah’s intention, we
are more than happy to acknowledge that Sarah remains employed
by North Homes
and as such we will continue to treat her accordingly.”
parties’ positions in overview
(1) The company considered whether to implement a business change, about
which it consulted with Ms Verheyen.
(2) While it implemented a change to appoint Mr Holmes as the sole
General Manager, it did not wish to sever its employment relationship
Ms Verheyen.
(3) It sought to engage in consultation with Ms Verheyen about an
ongoing role in the business or, if necessary, the terms on which
her employment
would end due to redundancy. This was frustrated by her absence on leave and her
engagement of lawyers to communicate
on her behalf.
(4) Indeed, an inference can be drawn that rather than engaging in the
consultation, Ms Verheyen instead decided to take various actions
prolong and obstruct the discussions in bad faith in a bid to maximise her
negotiating position for maximum financial gain.
(5) Ms Verheyen resigned, as evidenced by her returning her company
(6) North Homes did not act intentionally to force Ms Verheyen her to
resign, nor did its conduct leave her with no reasonable alternative
(7) In the circumstances, the resignation is to be seen as voluntary.
Ms Verheyen
submitted that her employment had been terminated at North Homes’
initiative. She contended that North Homes had
dismissed her through demoting
In the alternative, she
argued that it had repudiated her employment contract by declaring the Position
redundant and that she had
accepted that repudiation by commencing these
proceedings.
Ms Verheyen
submitted in the further alternative that she had been forced to resign.
Her written submissions included the following
contentions:
“The Applicant’s case, as set out in her Outline filed on 14
August 2025, is that: first, her employment ended at the
initiative of the
employer within s 386(1)(a), because her co-General Manager role was
abolished and her authority and duties were
materially diminished; and secondly,
in the alternative, any resignation was compelled within
s 386(1)(b).”
Ms Verheyen denied that she had resigned from her
employment.
She had also done so

been compelled to resign were advanced in the event that I found, contrary
her evidence, that she resigned. That is,
were I to find
resigned, I should also find that she had been forced to do so through a course
of conduct in which North Homes had engaged.
As will become clear, it is not
necessary to consider this submission or traverse all of the evidence led by the
parties regarding

and most significantly, I am not persuaded that North Homes offered
Ms Verheyen a particular role into which she could be redeployed.
the meeting on 23 April 2025, the Executive Board raised with Ms Verheyen
the possibility of redeployment. In that meeting
and in subsequent
correspondence it expressed a willingness to consult with her about
redeployment. However, no specific role was

Consistent with
that evidence, North Homes submitted that “the full detail and scope of
her new role was yet to be determined
through the
consultation”
“the role was not even finalised and remained subject to
consultation”.
to the extent that redeployment into a sales and marketing role was mooted,
I accept Ms Verheyen’s submissions that
it would have resulted
in a demotion for her. In her written and oral evidence, she described the scope
of her responsibilities in
the Position and how a role confined to sales and
marketing would have resulted in a significant diminution in those
responsibilities.
She would also have had to report to her former peer, Mr
regard. In its written material, it sought to argue
that the proposed sales
and marketing role would not have resulted in a significant diminution in
Ms Verheyen’s status or responsibilities,
relying in large part on
the fact that she would remain a senior management role on the same salary.
At the hearing, each of Mr Panabig,
Mr Dionysatos and
Ms Feng gave evidence to the effect that Ms Verheyen’s role
would remain essentially the same as the Position,
with only her reporting line
changing. However, after hearing from Ms Verheyen in cross-examination,
North Homes conceded in its
closing submissions that the suggested sales and
marketing role would have been different to the Position. In light of all of the
evidence, that concession was properly made.
Ms Verheyen’s duties and reporting line were contemplated by
employment contract. The contract in evidence was the one on which
Ms Verheyen initially commenced employment with North Homes
Customer Care and Workflow
It provided that she
was to perform the duties required of that position “and all other duties,
functions and responsibilities
as North Homes may reasonably require from time
to time”. It also required her to report to the then General Manager

properly be read as permitting the company
to declare Ms Verheyen’s
position redundant and requiring her to accept redeployment into a lesser role.
I observe that the
company had not sought to rely on the employment agreement in
this way when exploring redeployment with Ms Verheyen.
The consultation process
consultation with Ms Verheyen regarding her ongoing
employment. It
contended that it had maintained that position up to and including its letter to
DINA Lawyers of 14 July 2025. It
blamed circumstances (or bad faith on
Ms Verheyen’s part) for the fact that the consultation process had
not been concluded.
To my mind, these contentions were self-serving and
disingenuous.
her letter to the Executive Board of 7 May 2025 Ms Verheyen had made it
clear that she did not wish to explore redeployment. Instead,
she wished to take
the alternative option that had been offered to her, that is, negotiating a
redundancy package. North Homes entered
into those negotiations, which I infer
continued in the without prejudice correspondence between DINA Lawyers and
Mr Alkan. There
is nothing to suggest that redeployment was being
considered by either party in those negotiations.
any event, no alternative position had been offered to Ms Verheyen, and
there was no evidence of any role other than the sales
and marketing position
being available. What North Homes intended to consult with Ms Verheyen
repeated protestations that it wished to
continue discussions to secure Ms Verheyen’s continued employment
rang hollow.
these reasons, I do not accept that Ms Verheyen deliberately avoided
engaging in consultation regarding redeployment to maximise
her financial
return, much less that she acted in bad faith. Nothing other than a
redundancy package was up for discussion. There
is nothing necessarily untoward
in Ms Verheyen seeking maximise her payout.
further observe that Ms Verheyen was under no obligation to consult with
North Homes regarding redeployment or to accept another
role. Any failure by her
to do so did not lead to a stalemate, as North Homes’ submissions
suggested. That is, North Homes
had made the Position redundant. It could have
terminated Ms Verheyen’s employment on that basis. If it
considered that she
had been offered “other acceptable employment”,
it could have applied to the Commission under section 120 for a variation
amount of redundancy pay that Ms Verheyen would otherwise have been
entitled to receive under section 119.
of doing that, North Homes put Ms Verheyen on the proverbial “long
finger”. Its conduct might be seen as the flip
side of that which it
alleged against her. That is, that it asserted a willingness to
“consult” with Ms Verheyen about
an alternative position to put
pressure on her to reduce her expectations regarding a redundancy payment, or
simply to leave. However,
it is not necessary that I make any findings in that
The employment contract was repudiated
Ms Verheyen
submitted that North Homes’ decision to make the Position redundant was a
repudiation of her contract of employment.
Repudiation of contract in employment
can be broadly understood to encompass
(1) a party breaching the employment contact in such a way that the other
party is entitled to terminate the contract; or
(2) a party engaging in conduct that evinces an intention to no longer be
bound by the employment contract and/or an intention to
only fulfil the contract
in a manner substantially inconsistent with that party’s obligations under
the contract.
common law repudiatory conduct does not of itself terminate the
A repudiation
gives the innocent party the right to elect to terminate the contract. The
innocent party is “confronted”
with two inconsistent options: either
to accept the repudiation and bring about the end of the contract, or to affirm
the contract
and continue it. The innocent party may “keep the question
open, so long as he does not affirm the contract ... and so long
as the delay
does not cause prejudice to the other side”, but ultimately must make an
election because the law does not allow
a party to maintain two inconsistent
rights (or positions) and requires a choice to be

Ms Verheyen’s employment contract. Her situation was analogous

contracted for. He declined it, as was his contractual right.
The respondent by
its officers made clear that it would not continue to employ him to do his
previously-contracted work. He was entitled
to, and did, treat the contract of
employment as breached in a fundamental way by the respondent and to regard it
as terminated at
the instance of the employer.”
permitted to work from home was an affirmation of
the employment contract. I do
not agree. On the company’s evidence, negotiations regarding
Ms Verheyen’s departure were
continuing at that time. Asking that she
be permitted to work from home while those negotiations continued was, to my
mind, “keeping
the question open”. I consider it to be relevant in
this regard that at that time there was no job for Ms Verheyen to return
leads to North Homes’ decision to refuse Ms Verheyen permission to
work from home. Its reasons for doing so do not bear
have observed above, North Homes wrote to DINA Lawyers on 24 June 2025 setting
out those reasons. They included that “the
role” could not

“never operated such a role
on a remote basis”. However, at that
time Ms Verheyen had no role. Further, North Homes’ witnesses
accepted under cross-examination
that between 19 May 2025 and 24 June 2025 she
had not been directed to perform any duties. I am mindful that for some of that
