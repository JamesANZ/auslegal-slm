REASONS FOR
ALSTERGREN CJ, AUSTIN & SCHONELL JJ:
reasons explain why an application for leave to appeal and the consequent appeal
brought by the husband from an order made on
17 June 2025 by a judge of the
Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) must succeed.
appealed order permanently stayed the financial proceeding commenced by the
husband against the wife under
Family Law Act 1975
(“the Act”), supposedly due to Australia being “a clearly
inappropriate forum” within which to litigate
the financial cause
according to established legal principles (

stay order is vitiated by error and set aside, which result the wife
is now no need to re-consider the husband’s reciprocal application for an
anti-suit injunction against the wife to restrain
her prosecution of foreign
proceedings as the parties consensually resolved their dispute within the
original jurisdiction of the
Court, an integral part of which settlement is the
wife’s discontinuance of the foreign proceedings.
parties commenced a relationship in 1997, married in 1999, and separated in
early 2022 while in Australia (at [5(e) and 5(p)]).
They are not yet

lived in Singapore. Both are permanent residents
of Australia but citizens of
other countries.
parties’ assets are situated in Singapore and Australia, though
principally Singapore. The property, corporate interests
and trust assets in

husband commenced the Australian proceedings in July 2024, seeking both final
and interim financial relief (at [6] and [98]).
The wife responded in October
2024, seeking an order staying the husband’s financial claim (at [1]). The
husband countered
in March 2025 with an amended application seeking an anti-suit
injunction against the wife, motivated by her having instituted competing
proceedings in Singapore in February 2025 (at [7(a)]).
pending within the Singaporean proceedings are the wife’s application for
an anti-suit injunction restraining the husband
from prosecuting the Australian
proceedings (at [7(c)]), and the husband’s application to permanently stay
the Singaporean
proceedings (at [7(d)]).
Australian proceedings were listed before the primary judge in May 2025 to hear
and determine the wife’s application to
stay the husband’s claim for
financial relief, on account of the Australian court supposedly being a clearly
inappropriate
forum (at [1]–[2]).
parties agreed the primary judge should first determine the wife’s stay
application (at [84] and [95]). The husband’s
reciprocal application for
an anti-suit injunction against the wife only needed to be determined if the
stay application failed because,
if granted, the husband’s application was
rendered superfluous (at [83]).
wife’s stay application was granted by an order made in these

husband sought leave to appeal and, if granted, prosecuted the grounds of appeal
set out within his Amended Notice of Appeal filed
on 22 September
Leave to Appeal
husband accepts he needs leave to appeal from the “judgment”
embodied in the stay order, as it is interlocutory in
is never fettered, but the grant of leave ordinarily requires demonstration the
decision at first instance is attended
by sufficient doubt to warrant appellate
scrutiny and, additionally, substantial injustice would result if leave were
refused, supposing
the decision at first instance to be wrong (
(2016) FLC 93-692 at [44]–[57]).
of the judgment reveals it is vitiated by error and there can be little doubt
the husband would suffer substantial injustice
if (absent agreement between the
parties) the stay order prevails and precludes his pursuit of the full panoply
of financial relief
he could seek in the Australian proceedings, not available
in the Singaporean proceedings. Leave to appeal should therefore be

of the appealable errors,
without needing to address the grounds of appeal individually.
primary judge had to decide this solitary question: is the Australian court a
clearly inappropriate forum to hear and determine
the financial cause between
the parties?
the past, this Court has expressed different views about whether the answer to
that question is evaluative (
Talwar & Sarai
[2018] FamCAFC 152

) or discretionary

–[16] and [35];
Cattaneo & Okeke
[2025] FedCFamC1A 43
, [18] and [40]), which
inconsistency is unhelpful and should now be clarified.
answer to the question is binary: either the Australian court is or is not a
clearly inappropriate forum. There can only be one
correct answer, even though
it is a value judgment (
GLJ v The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for
the Diocese of Lismore
[2023] HCA 32
(2023) 280 CLR 442
Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v SZVFM
[2018] HCA 30
(2018) 264 CLR 541
–[49]). If the answer is affirmative, the primary judge was obliged
to make the stay order. Conversely, if the answer is negative,
his Honour was
obliged to dismiss the stay application and let the Australian proceedings
continue. There was no discretionary scope
to do otherwise. The decision is
evaluative – not discretionary.
Discretionary
judgments differ from evaluative judgments as the law admits of more than one
correct answer within a tolerable range
GLJ v The Trustees of the Roman
Catholic Church for the Diocese of Lismore
at [16] and [26]). The law
does not tolerate multiple correct answers to the question of whether Australia
is a clearly inappropriate
four consequences flow.
this Court is not now obliged to approach the original decision presuming it was
correct, as it must do in respect of appeals
from discretionary decisions
Australian Coal and Shale Employees’ Federation v The Commonwealth
[1953] HCA 25
(1953) 94 CLR 621
complaints of discretionary error have no place in this intended appeal which
lies from an evaluative judgment (
Yoxall & Eide
[2024] FedCFamC1A 200
the appellate function is to now apply the “correctness standard”
and determine whether the primary judge’s
decision was right or wrong
GLJ v The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Diocese of Lismore
at [15]–[17] and [22]–[26]). This being an appeal by way of
re-hearing, the identification of error by the primary judge
is an indispensable
condition to appellate interference (
Allesch v Maunz
[2000] HCA 40
(2000) 203 CLR 172
–[23] and [44];
Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd v AIRC
(2000) 203 CLR 194
at [15]–[18] and [70]–[76]).
if the original decision is wrong, given the relative absence of conflict in the
evidence, this Court is as well placed
as the primary judge to determine the
stay application afresh (
GLJ v The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for
the Diocese of Lismore
at [27]–[28];
Warren v Coombes
[1979] HCA 9
142 CLR 531
at 538 and 552).
appealed judgment is vitiated by both legal and factual errors.
Legal errors
primary judge correctly acknowledged the wife bore the burden of proving the
Australian court was “a clearly inappropriate
forum”, the rigour of
which test had to be distinguished from the less stringent and erroneous enquiry
as to which of the foreign
and local court was the “more
appropriate” forum of the two (at [104], [128], [133] and [137]).
husband correctly exhorted the primary judge to heed the important distinction,
because his Honour recited his submission in the
reasons for judgment this way:
for the [husband] submitted that the court in
Navarro & Jurado
that the task of a judge in my shoes is not to weigh the relevant factors
against one another and instead the task of the first
instance judge is to
assess whether enough factors exist to indicate that the relevant forum is the
clearly inappropriate forum.
The court further held that if significant factors
point to the conclusion that the chosen forum is appropriate, it is immaterial
that many factors suggest that another forum might be appropriate or even more
appropriate. In that case it was also held that the
weighing of factors to see
where the balance lies would, in effect, be to undertake a
“more appropriate forum” test.
(Footnotes omitted)
the primary judge did not heed the warning. While his Honour did say the
Australian court was “the clearly inappropriate
forum” (at [3] and
[152]), his Honour also said this as the overarching explanation for the
the reasons that follow,
in my judgment the court in Singapore is capable of
most comprehensively determining all issues between the parties
the stay order

proceedings pending the hearing and determination of [proceedings number]

choice of language cannot be easily disregarded as merely semantic. It intimates
established legal principles were not correctly
applied. Basing the stay
decision upon the Singaporean court being the preferable forum because it can
“most comprehensively
determin[e]” the issues in dispute represents
a material error of law because the conclusion deflected attention from the
question of whether the Australian court was a clearly inappropriate

primary judge’s error may have been induced by the wife’s submission
that “the litigation between the parties
was more appropriately addressed
by the courts of [Singapore]” (at [2]) but, if legal error is
demonstrated, it hardly matters
how it arose.
if such literal analysis of the reasons is too fussy and it is instead presumed
the primary judge did resort to the correct test
despite the looseness of
language, his Honour failed to apply the governing legal principles to the
material findings of fact. To
exemplify the failure, it is necessary to
summarise the reasons for judgment.
primary judge canvassed the factual evidence adduced by the parties (at
[5]–[41]), recounted the uncontroversial expert
opinion evidence given
legal principles governing the
disposition of the dispute (at [83]–[95]),
recited the content of the parties’ written and oral submissions (at
[96]–[131]),
and then finished with a generic discussion (at
[132]–[152]).
the many salient facts established by both the evidence and the submissions, and
notwithstanding the primary judge acknowledged
“no one particular factor
predominates” by tipping the outcome (at [134]), the stay decision was
seemingly premised upon
this single factor: most assets are in Singapore and no
Australian orders
could be made in respect of the Singaporean
assets – the Australian court could only make orders
in personam
between the parties (at [149]–[152]).

the proceeding going forward in Singapore will not provide complete relief on
all issues,

(b) insofar as Singaporean assets are involved, orders

(c) it is likely to produce additional costs and the potential of duplication of

it is a question of extent and degree when determining whether this court is the
clearly inappropriate forum.
Neither forum provides complete relief on all

expressed, the conclusion hinges narrowly on most of the parties’ wealth
being situated in Singapore, thereby exposing how
the following retinue of
influential factual findings were not synthesised with the legal principles
governing the disposition of
the stay dispute:
(a) the husband started the Australian proceedings seven months before the wife
started the Singaporean proceedings, though that
of itself is not a dispositive
feature (at [106]);
(b) the Singaporean courts’ jurisdiction to determine the financial cause
between the spouses is usually contingent upon their
divorce being granted in
Singapore (at [83] and [148(c)]), which is not the case in Australia, and
although divorce applications
were and still are pending in both jurisdictions
(at [119(j)]), the Australian divorce application was filed first in time, was
for hearing before the primary judge, and was only being delayed by the
dispute over the stay application (at [83]–[84]);
(c) the parties are permanent residents of Australia, lived in Australia for a
good part of their married lives, still conduct business
activities in
Australia, and have valuable property interests in Australia (at [10],
[27]–[29], [33]–[34] and [139]–[141]);
(d) the Australian proceeding is advantageous to the husband, as it offers him
resort to forms of financial relief not matched within
the Singaporean
proceedings, including:
(i) Australia will treat the wife’s inherited wealth in Singapore as part
of the overall corpus of property amenable to an
adjustment order between the
spouses, whereas Singapore will disregard such assets unless the inherited
property was found to have
been “converted” to matrimonial property
(at [6], [8], [43(d)], [44], [51]–[52], [103(a)], [142] and [148(b)]);
(ii) the husband cannot pursue his pending application for spousal maintenance
in Singapore (at [37], [65], [98(a)], [100], [103(d)],
[142], [146], [148(a)]
and [150(c)]);
(iii) the husband cannot pursue his pending application for interim property
settlement or “litigation funding” in Singapore
(at [38]–[40],
[64], [68], [103(c)], [142], [146] and [148(d)]); and
(iv) the Singaporean courts will not likely entertain the husband’s
allegations of the wife’s “economic abuse and
control” (at [32], [41] and [69]).
(e) even though the Australian court could not make an order
affecting property in Singapore, nor could Singaporean courts make orders
in respect of Australian assets – only orders
in personam
between the parties – so neither jurisdiction enjoys an advantage in
respect of the reach of its powers;
(f) the husband’s pending application was for 40 per cent of the
“net asset pool” rather than his conferral with
ownership of
particular assets (at [6] and [98(b)]) and it is always open to the Australian
court to make an adjustment order compelling
the wife to pay the husband a sum
of money, the amount of which could be calculated by reference to the value of
property situated
in Singapore; and
(g) an Australian property adjustment order compelling the wife to pay a sum of
money to the husband would be a money judgment capable
of registration and
enforcement in Singapore (at [74]–[78], [101(g)], [109], [146], [148(a)]
and [148(g)]).
the failure to usefully deploy such influential findings, the following
submission of the husband must be accepted as being
in the introductory part of the Judgment titled ‘Upshot’, in
[paragraph 3 of the reasons for judgment] his Honour
found that the court in
Singapore (our emphasis),
“is capable of most comprehensively
determining
between the parties”.
That finding
does not intelligibly follow or summarise the ‘upshot’ of the other
parts of the Judgment or ultimate conclusions
in [paragraphs 150–152 of
the reasons for judgment], where, for example, his Honour expressly acknowledged
that the [husband’s]
claim to spouse maintenance would be likely to
” in the event the litigation occurred in Singapore.
That finding also failed to explain how the ultimate effect of his
Order, hiving off the inherited wealth from determination of the
property division between the parties in Singapore, could result
‘comprehensive’ determination of the issues between the
(Husband’s Summary of Argument filed 22 September 2025) (Footnotes

is not to say there were not countervailing considerations. For example: the
parties have as much connection with Singapore as
they do with Australia; most
of the wife’s property is situated in Singapore (at [141] and [148(e)]);
and there will potentially
be more expert valuation evidence needed concerning
the Singaporean assets (at [111], [141] and [143]).
though, the decision required of his Honour was whether the Australian court was
“a clearly inappropriate forum”
– not whether the Singaporean
courts were arguably better suited. The mere balance of convenience enjoyed by a
foreign jurisdiction
will not justify the stay of the domestic action (
Factual errors
material factual errors are evident in the reasons for judgment.

the wife’s assets:

Singaporean property ...
finding was mistaken. The wife’s father died 10 years ago (at [17]) and
she deposed to inheriting his deceased estate, subject
to fulfilling an
obligation to maintain her mother, who personally inherited nothing (at [18]).
The wife deposed this in her affidavit
affirmed on 12 May 2025:
When my father passed away, I inherited the vast majority of his substantial
estate but am required under the Will to maintain
and care for my mother to the
same standard she had enjoyed during my parents’ marriage and for the rest
of her life ...

was no evidence at all to find the wife’s mother now asserts some form of
legal or equitable interest in the wife’s
Singaporean assets, in which
case the error converts from factual to legal (

the primary judge made this finding about the parties’ costs:
144. Costs [of the parties] were approximately equal, around $140,000 to date.
finding was mistaken. On the day of the hearing before the primary judge, costs
notices were filed by the parties showing the
husband had incurred about
$382,000 in legal fees and the wife had incurred about $350,000 in legal fees.
The proceedings were only
in their relative infancy, so the legal costs had the
potential to increase exponentially.
mistaken finding was significant because his Honour accepted the wife’s
submission and found the parties could litigate
on an “equal
footing” (at [113] and [116(g)]). His Honour rejected the husband’s
submission of his financial disadvantage,
simply because he had $100,000 in a
bank account (at [145]), but the credit balance in the account would not sustain
him for long,
hence his pending applications for spousal maintenance and
litigation funding.
the wife deposed she had given the husband a line of credit to draw down $20,000
per month and allowed him unfettered access
to an account with a credit balance
of $480,000 (at [126]), first, it was quite unclear whether the wife expected
withdrawals on
the line of credit to be repaid, and secondly, there was nothing
to prevent the wife from terminating such fiscal largesse at her

if this proceeding goes forward in Australia, several consequences will follow.
(c) it is likely to produce additional costs and the potential of duplication of
effort and costs if the litigation were continued
in Australia.
finding was mistaken. At the very least, it assumes the Singaporean proceedings
would continue regardless of what happens to the
Australian proceedings, which
assumption could not be made in the face of the husband’s countervailing
application for an anti-suit
injunction against the wife to restrain her pursuit
of the Singaporean proceedings. None of the wife’s submissions comprised
contention about duplication of effort and costs (at [99], [101], [102], [103],
[105], [107], [109]–[116], [122], [127] and
[129]) as both parties
implicitly accepted that only the Singaporean or Australian proceedings would
continue. Nor was there any
evidentiary premise for the finding, as the wife
said nothing of the sort in either of her two affidavits filed in May 2025. Nor
was the finding the subject of earlier discussion in the reasons for judgment.
the primary judge found this about the Singaporean proceedings:
150. ... If the litigation goes forward in Singapore –
(a) the overwhelming value of assets will be the subject of such order ...
finding was mistaken. If the litigation proceeds in Singapore, most of the
Singaporean assets, said to be worth about $254 million,
will be disregarded in
the process and will not be “the subject of such order” because the
wife contends such assets
were inherited (at [103(a)], [119(h)], [119(o)],
[130(j)] and [130(k)]). She deposed this in her affidavit affirmed on 12 May
have outlined a schedule of my assets below which total approximately AUD$295
AUD$254 million comprises of my inherited assets
which are located entirely in Singapore
majority of my assets are in Singapore. They consist of my gifts and inheritance
and they vastly exceed those located in Australia
(Emphasis added)
husband could still argue for the wife’s inherited Singaporean assets to
be included and considered within the Singaporean
financial cause due to their
“conversion” to matrimonial assets, but the wife has already implied
her resistance to that
approach by putting the husband to proof on the issue.
She submitted this in her Summary of Argument document filed at first instance
on 23 May 2025:
Wife has an advantage in Singapore as pre-marital assets and assets received by
gift or inheritance do not form part of the asset
pool available for division
between the parties. This is unless such assets are ‘converted’ into
matrimonial assets,
by being ordinarily used during the marriage for the family
or being substantially improved during the marriage by the other party.
Accordingly
, the onus will fall on the Husband to persuade the Court that the
assets (or some of them) are to be included in the asset pool
. On the face
of his documents filed in Singapore the Husband is going to make this argument
in respect to some assets in Singapore.

the primary judge found this about the Australian proceedings:
Conversely,
if the proceeding goes forward in this court, most of the assets in value in

finding was mistaken. If the financial cause proceeds in Australia, the Court
must take account of
existing property interests of the parties

Singapore, however she acquired them. While the Australian court could
