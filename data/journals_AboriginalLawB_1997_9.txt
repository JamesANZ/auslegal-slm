recognised in amendments to legislation.
An action plan should be worked out to improve health and social conditions,
including a system of healing centres and lodges under
Indigenous control.
Federal, Provincial and Territorial governments should commit to training
10,000 Indigenous professionals in health and social services.
Adequate housing should be made available over the next 10 years to
Indigenous people on reserves and in rural northern and urban
communities.
An Indigenous-controlled education system should be developed.
Indigenous language programs should be compulsory, and School Boards should
also be required to hire Indigenous teachers and administrators.
The Federal Government should provide $10 million annually for five years to
support Indigenous languages foundations.
An Indigenous arts council should be established.
A Youth policy should be developed.
Governments should be prepared to negotiate with representatives of
self-government and to provide adequate land bases.
Indigenous representatives should be involved in all planning for future
Constitutional discussions and hold a veto over changes to
sections involving
Indigenous rights.
