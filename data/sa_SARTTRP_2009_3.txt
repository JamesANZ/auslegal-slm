Doecke v Evans [2009] SARTTRP 3 (9 February 2009)
Section 83 - Order for possession
Doecke v Evans (RP09/0002)
Order for possession on the basis the tenant caused a serious interference
with the peace, comfort and privacy of the park owner who
resides in the
immediate vicinity of the park.
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON 9 FEBRUARY
Hearing 9 February 2009 at Adelaide
DOECKE v EVANS (RP09/0002)
This is the determination of an application lodged on 4 February 2009 by
Gavin Doecke, the park owner of the Avoca Dell Caravan Park
at Murray Bridge. .
It seeks an order of the Tribunal for “serious misconduct”. In
fact, I am satisfied that Mr Doecke
seeks an order for vacant possession.
Mr Doecke appeared before the Tribunal and gave sworn evidence. There was no
appearance by or on behalf of Ms Evans. I am satisfied
that due notice of the
Hearing was given to Ms Evans. I also heard sworn evidence from Mr
Doecke’s witnesses
Ms Emily Lewis and Mr Peter Barnett.
On the basis of the evidence, I find that from 7 February 1999 a periodic
residential park site agreement within the meaning of the
Residential Parks Act,
(“the Act”) was entered into between Gavin Doecke as park owner
and Wendy Evans as resident in relation to site number
32 at the Avoca Dell
Caravan Park 199/213 Murray Drive, Murray Bridge. Rent payable under the
agreement is currently $80.00 per
week payable fortnightly. No security bond
was payable under the agreement entered into between the parties. I find the
is subject to the Act.
Mr Doecke told me that Ms Evans is the only permanent resident at the caravan
park and she has been a source of ongoing problems over
the ten years in which
she has been at the park. The difficulties have included that she rakes the
rubble near her caravan sometimes
until the early hours of the morning thus
upsetting tourists. She has repeatedly been told to turn down loud music and
not to waste
water. He said that she has painted the concrete on her site and
when paying rent has sometimes put it in a plastic bag and thrown
it to him with
a rock in the bag. He said that he has had to duck to avoid being hit by it.
He said the big issue arose on Friday,
30 January 2009. He said that Ms Evans
had previously requested that he supply her with a wooden ladder. Mr Doecke
said that he
does not have a wooden ladder and so was unable to accommodate her
wish. He said that she then accused him of taking her air conditioner
roof of her caravan.
Mr Doecke said that on Friday, 30 January 2009 his wife went out shopping.
He was at home. He said that his house is within the
park grounds. He said
that someone rang his front door bell. He said that he opened the door. Ms
Evans was there. He said she
barged into his house without being asked and
started accusing him about the ladder and the air conditioner. Mr Doecke told
he continually told her to leave his house. She would not do so. Mr
Doecke said that his daughter, Ms Lewis happened to be visiting
him at the time.
She was out of sight to Ms Evans but after he had told her several times to
leave without success, his daughter
came into view and also told Ms Evans to
leave. Mr Doecke said that Ms Evans ignored his daughter. Mr Doecke then said
would call the police.
Ms Evans said words to the effect that “that would save her a
job”. He then telephoned the police. He said that his
positioned herself in the hallway to prevent Ms Evans going any further but she
went straight past his daughter. Mr Doecke
said that Ms Evan’s manner was
very disturbing. She was continually talking and accusing him. He said that Ms
left shortly prior to the police attending. He said that his
grandchildren were visiting at the time and they were very frightened.
As a result of the incident Mr Doecke said that he sought advice and then
served a Notice of Termination upon Ms Evans. He provided
a copy of the Notice
with his application. It requires that Ms Evans give up possession of the site
at the caravan park by Monday,
2 February 2009. Mr Doecke told me that he was
accompanied by Mr Peter Barnett when he served the Notice of Termination. He
that he went to the caravan occupied by Ms Evans but Ms Evans refused to
answer. He therefore called out to her that he had a Notice
of Termination
which he would leave for her. Ms Evans replied that she would tear up the
Notice. Mr Doecke told me that he then
left the Notice in the same spot where
Ms Evan’s mail is left namely under a stone on her motorbike.
The evidence given by Ms Lewis was that she was at her parent’s house
on Friday, 30 January at the time at which Ms Evans went
to their home. Ms
Lewis confirmed the evidence given by her father. She also confirmed that
despite repeated requests by herself
and her father she refused to leave the
premises until after the police had been called. Mr Barnett confirmed the
evidence given
by Mr Doecke of the service of the Notice of Termination upon Ms
I am satisfied that a Notice of Termination (Form E) was served on Ms Evans
on 30 January 2009. I find the Notice of Termination
to be technically valid
and properly served. I also accept the evidence given by Mr Doecke of Ms
Evan’s conduct in general
and in particular on Friday, 30 January 2009 at
his house. I am satisfied that Mr Doecke’s house does not form part of
residential park within the meaning of the Act. I am however satisfied that
his house is in the immediate vicinity of the residential
I am satisfied that Ms Evan’s conduct on 30 January 2009 was as
described by Mr Doecke and Ms Lewis. I am satisfied that this
behaviour was a
serious interference with the reasonable peace, comfort and privacy of Mr
Doecke. Mr Doecke was therefore at liberty
to serve the Notice of Termination
to terminate the residential park site agreement which he has with Ms Evans. As
Ms Evans has
failed to vacate the site in accordance with the Notice of
Termination it falls to me to consider making an order for possession
rented property under
of the Act.
I am satisfied that the Notice of Termination served by Mr Doecke terminated
the residential park site agreement and that an order
for possession of the
rented property should be made. In the absence of Ms Evans, I shall make an
order that she give up possession
at 11.00 am on Monday, 16 February 2009. If
she does not do so then the order for possession may be enforced by the Tribunal
Pursuant to
the Act, I make an order for possession of site 32
at the Avoca Dell Caravan Park at 199/213 Murray Drive, Murray Bridge at 11.00
am on Monday, 16 February 2009 on condition that if the resident fails to give
up possession then this order may only be enforced
by the Tribunal bailiff.
