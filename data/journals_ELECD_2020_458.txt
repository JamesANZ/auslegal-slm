Abstract/Description:
This chapter briefly explores the relationships between international investment law and EU law. It focuses first on the ‘intra
-EU’ dimension of the issue, which seems to evolve towards a termination of BITs between Member States. The chapter then addresses
the external dimension of the matter. The EU is indeed trying to build a common policy regarding foreign investment, including a
slight reform of substantive rules of protection and an important change in the dispute settlement mechanism which may replace arbitration
in the long run.
