REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
John Davie and Jennifer Ann Davie (“the applicants”) seek an order
with respect to the site agreement that permitted
them to continue to locate
their home on a site situated in the park owned and operated by Claremont Resort
Park Ridge (“the
respondent”).
applicants seek an order that the directors of Claremont Resort advise the
applicants in writing that the terms of the Annexure
to the Mobile Home
Agreement will be honoured and the shed purchased by the applicants in good
faith as part of the property located
at Lot 1 forms part of the chattels of the
property and may be included in any sale of the property which may eventuate in
the future.
issue of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter was
also raised for consideration.
facts in this matter were not in dispute.
applicants are the owners of a manufactured home (“the home”)
situated on site 1 (site 1) of the Claremont Resort
Park Ridge, 431 Park Ridge
Road, Park Ridge Brisbane (“the park”).
Hammond Village
”, was owned by Mr Paul Hampson and
others with Mr Hampson the park manager.
the time they owned the home, Mr Sadlier constructed, with Mr Hampson’s
consent, a 28 x 14 feet lock up shed (the shed),
to the north of the home but
not on designated site 1 land.
or about February 2002 the applicants were negotiating to purchase the home and
shed from Mr and Mrs Sadlier and they knew the
shed was not located on land
within the designated boundaries of site 1. They spoke to Mr and Mrs Sadlier as
to the status of the
shed, who assured them that Mr Hampson had given his
authorization to build the shed where it was erected. They also sought advice
from a solicitor, and this led to the document being drafted and executed by Mr
Hampson saying that the shed was designated as part
of the site.
issue of the shed was of considerable concern to the applicants and it was one
of the deciding factors that persuaded them to
purchase the home as they owned a
large caravan that needed housing in an appropriate sized shed.
applicants entered into a contract dated 8 February 2002 to buy the home from Mr
and Mrs Sadlier (the contract), and this contract
contained a clause stating
that the home, the fittings and the “
28 feet, by 14 feet garage and all
landscaping
” were included in the sale.
document executed by Mr Hampson, also dated 8 Feb 2002 (the Annexure), and
attached to the contract expressly provided, so far
as relevant –
“Management agrees that the occupier:
carport/shed located on the northern side of the premises is designated as part
of ‘the site’. However is
subject to normal council regulations in
respect of building and approvals.
existing residents, Mr and Mrs Sadlier, have approval from management to occupy
the premises subject to agreement with the purchasers.”
four years later and in December 2006 the applicants formed an intention to sell
the home. By this time, Mr Hammond was the
managing director of Hammond Village
and he advised the applicants that the shed could not be included in the sale
because of its
location. Efforts to resolve the matter to the applicants’
satisfaction were not successful. Mr Hammond forwarded a letter,
dated 16 June
2006, setting out the park owner’s position. This letter provided
“In regard to the manufactured home situated upon Lot 1
Hammond Village Park Ridge, we confirm at previous conversation in the
site known as Lot 1 HVPR contains the manufactured home.
garage constructed adjacent to Lot 1 HVPR on the left hand side is not contained
within Lot 1 HVPR, however remains the property
of the present owners of the
dwelling known as Lot 1 HVPR.
garage constructed adjacent to Lot 1 HVPR on the left hand side is not a part of
the chattels of Lot 1 HVPR, shall not form a
part of the sale of the chattels
upon Lot 1 HVPR, and is not and shall not be included in any site agreement
pertaining to Lot 1
garage constructed adjacent to Lot 1 HVPR may remain as is until such as HVPR
management requires use of the land thereupon.
HVPR decide that they require the use of the land adjacent to Lot 1 HVPR which
contains the garage, they shall provide no less
than three (3) months written
notice to the letterbox of the occupier/s of Lot 1 HVPR.”
Hampson admits that he gave approval to Mr and Mrs Sadlier to erect the shed on
the land adjacent to site 1, and after referring
to the sale of the home to the
applicants, he continued:
“Included in the sale was a large 28’ x 14’
lock up shed located on the northern side of the property. I gave approval
Mr and Mrs Sadlier to erect a shed on the land adjacent to the property.
During negotiations for the sale to Mr and Mrs Davie I was made aware of
their concerns regarding the location of the shed. I agreed
to sign a statement
confirming that the shed was designated as part of the site. ‘Annexure to
Agreement’ dated 8/2/02
was therefore prepared and signed by me. As part
Owner/Manager of Hammond Village at that time I was authorised to make this
2007 the park was sold to new owners, its name was changed to the Claremont
Resort Park Ridge, the new manager was Mr Richardson
and Mrs Ingrid Darmadjaja
was a director. After the change of ownership the applicants approached the new
management seeking an
assurance that the terms of the Annexure would be
honoured. Application in the Tribunal.
surveyor, Mr Somerville, a consultant for the original park development has
filed a statement stating that in October 1998
an application was prepared to
expand the then existing park to include relocatable homes. At that time, site
1 was identified as
a problem area as a shed was associated with the residence
but it was not located on the site. Mr Somerville has attached to his
a copy of the original plan showing the location of all the sites in the park
and the facilities, a plan that became the
new plan of development for the park.
According to this plan, site 1 is located on the north east corner of the park
and near designated
parking spaces. Mr Somerville said that the area where the
shed is located was not an area dedicated for residential development
dwellings, but is a buffer zone described as non-development space, and was
designated for future shop and car park development.
Mr Somerville was not
aware if a present intention existed to build a car park and a shop on this
space, but it was expected that
this could occur in the near future as the
growing local population would justify the construction of the shop.
Somerville said that when the application was made in 1998 to expand the park
the shed was in existence on the land near to site
1 but he could not recall
whether it is the structure that presently exists in that same position.
Mr Somerville said that a similar situation recently occurred elsewhere in the
park. After the applicants purchased the home, Mr
& Mrs Sadlier constructed
a new home on site 61 at the park and constructed a shed on land adjacent to
site 61. Subsequently,
Mr Somerville as surveyor was instructed to apply to the
Logan City Council to amend the plan of development 3230-12B and lodge a
building application, so this shed was included in an expanded site 61. The
Council granted this application and approved the increase
in size of site 61.
The park owner did not oppose this application as the land upon which shed was
located was designated as residential
Somerville expressed the view that the owners of the house located on site 1
would need to make an application to amend the plan
of development with the
Logan City Council and also obtain building application approval to enable site
1 to be expanded to include
the land upon which the shed is located. However,
he does not believe this application would be successful as the shed is located
on land that is designated for a proposed shop and car park, whereas the land
near site 61 was designated as residential land.
Applicant’s submissions
applicants seek an order that the land on which the shed is located is part of
the site and the park owners are required to acknowledge
the validity of the
It is submitted that the respondent is bound by the Annexure.
Respondent’s submissions
respondent submitted the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entertain this
submitted that the respondent is not a party to the agreement regarding the site
boundaries.
Furthermore, for site one to be extended, Council approval and building approval
would need to be obtained and this was anticipated
in the Annexure as it
expressly stated that it “
is subject to normal council regulations in
respect of the buildings and approvals
it would oppose any extension of site 1 as it may wish to
construct a new shop and parking facilities in the same location.
Legislation
following provisions of the
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act
(MHRP Act) are relevant:
“19 Terms of site agreement include responsibilities
under Act etc.
The following are taken to be included as terms of a site
(a) the home owner’s responsibilities under

140 Site agreement dispute
If there is a site agreement dispute, either party to the dispute may
apply to the tribunal for an order, and the tribunal may make
any order it
considers appropriate, to resolve the dispute.”
Observations and findings
the hearing a copy of the site agreement was not tendered as an exhibit nor was
it filed as an annexure to the statements, but
it was not disputed that a valid
site agreement was in force between the applicants and the respondent that
permitted the applicants
to continue to locate their manufactured home on site 1
at the park.
It is not disputed that on the 8 February 2002 the applicants purchased the home
located on site 1 from Mr and Mr Sadlier who originally
located the home on site
1 pursuant to a Mobile Home agreement. It was not disputed that the applicants
are home owners, the respondent
is a park owner, the home is a manufactured home
and the applicants and the respondent are the parties to a site agreement as
in the MHRP Act. Finally, it was not disputed that Mr Hampson gave
permission for the shed to be located on park land outside site
1 and that he
executed the Annexure.
is no evidence as to the exact date when the lock up shed was constructed on the
land. The tribunal file contains a tax invoice
dated 1 Nov 2000 for the purchase
by Mr Tom Sadlier of a kit carport but it is not stated whether this kit carport
was erected at
the park or whether it was the structure around which the lock up
shed was constructed. To the contrary, Mr Somerville said a shed
was located in
the same position in 1998 but he could not say if it was the same shed that
presently stands adjacent to site 1.
I do not consider it necessary to make a
finding as to when the shed was constructed but I do find it was constructed by
during the time when he and Mrs Sadlier owned the home and it was
erected with the approval of Mr Hampson.
issue for consideration is whether the land upon which the shed was built is now
a part of site 1.
only provision of the MHRP Act that can give the Tribunal power to consider this
matter is section 140. The power granted by
this section is a general power to
resolve site agreement disputes. A site agreement dispute is defined as a
dispute between the
parties to a site agreement about the rights and obligations
under the agreement or this Act.
140 provides that if there is a site agreement dispute, either party to the
dispute may apply to the Tribunal for an order,
and the Tribunal may make any
order it considers appropriate, to resolve the dispute
issue as to whether site 1 was extended to include the land upon which the shed
is located or whether the site agreement was varied
to include this land is a
site agreement dispute. It is a dispute about the rights and obligations of the
parties under the site
agreement or the MHRP Act.
am satisfied the Tribunal does have jurisdiction to hear and determine this
next question is to determine if the site was extended to include the land upon
which the shed was built.
respondent conceded that the applicants own the shed and that it is not
interfering with the applicants’ right to own the
shed as a chattel. The
respondent maintains site 1 has not been extended and the shed stands on the
respondent’s land designated
for future shop and car parking.
basis of the consent given by Mr Hampson to erect the shed is specified in the
Annexure. It says that the carport or shed located
on the northern side of the
premises is designated as part of the site however it was subject to normal
council regulations in respect
of the building and approvals. In other words,
for the size of site 1 to be extended the Logan City Council must give the
approvals and consents.
accept the evidence of Mr Somerville that the procedure adopted for site 61
should equally be applied to site 1. I accept his evidence
that an application
must be made to the Logan City Council to amend the development plan and obtain
building approval. The Council
must give its approval before the boundaries of
site 1 can be altered.
my view the designated area of site 1 cannot be amended until the necessary
approvals are obtained. This is not only a requirement
of town planning law but
is a requirement of the terms of the Annexure that specified the arrangements
between the applicant and
the then park owner were subject to normal council
regulations in respect of buildings and approvals.
these circumstances I dismiss the application.
application is dismissed.
