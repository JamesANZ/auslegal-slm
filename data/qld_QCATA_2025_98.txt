APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
REASONS FOR DECISION
an Application for leave to appeal or appeal filed on 31 January 2025
(‘the Appeal Application’), the Applicants
seek leave to appeal, and
to appeal, a decision of Adjudicator Murphy made on 4 December 2024 in relation
to a residential tenancy
Applicants had sought orders from Adjudicator Murphy requiring the Respondent
tenant to pay them $3,055.72 as rent arrears,
together with $302.50 for
cleaning, and a further amount of $759 as a ‘break lease’ fee.
However, the effect of the
orders made by Adjudicator Murphy on 4 December 2024
was to dismiss the Applicants claim for rental arrears and for payment of the
break lease fee, and to allow only the $302.50 claim for cleaning costs.
[3] Also on 31
January 2025, the Applicants commenced a related Application, seeking an
extension of time for the filing of the Application
for leave to appeal or
appeal (‘the extension of time application’).
[4] The learned
Adjudicator’s decision was made orally on 4 December 2024, and on 5
December 2024 the Applicants had requested
a transcript of those oral reasons,
which was provided to them on 7 January 2025. Pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(Qld) (‘QCAT
Act’), an application for the Appeal Tribunal’s leave to appeal must
be filed in the registry ‘within
28 days after the relevant day’.
Where (as here) a person requests written reasons of the decision s 143(5)(c)
provides that
the ‘relevant day’ becomes the ‘day the person
is given written reasons for the decision being appealed against’;
meaning that it was always permissible for the Applicants to file an Application
for leave to appeal or appeal within 28 days
after 7 January 2025. As the
Appeal Application was received by the Tribunal on 31 January 2025 it was filed
within time, thus making
an extension of time application unnecessary.
Leave to appeal is required
[5] Although an
extension of time within which to file the appeal application was unnecessary,
leave obtained from the Appeal Tribunal
to bring the appeal is however required,
because of s 142(3)(a)(i) of the QCAT Act.
[6] Leave to
appeal is not automatic, and nor will it be easily granted. In accordance with
longstanding principles, findings of
fact made at first instance with evidence
to support them and free from glaring
improbability
will seldom be
disturbed on appeal.
Judicial Member D J
McGill SC observed:
....As a general proposition, when leave to appeal to the Appeal Tribunal is
required, it will be granted only where there is a reasonable
argument that the
decision was attended by error and an appeal is necessary to correct a
substantial injustice caused by that error,
or where the appeal raises a
question of general importance upon which further argument and a decision of the
Appeal Tribunal would
be to the public advantage. In deciding whether grounds
for leave to appeal have been shown, it is relevant to consider that the
proceeding was a minor civil dispute, and the obligation on the Tribunal was to
make orders it considered to be fair and equitable
to the parties to the
proceeding in order to resolve the dispute: the QCAT Act s 13(1). The Tribunal
was also required to comply
with the QCAT Act s 28 and s 29.
determining whether to grant leave, the Appeal Tribunal must be satisfied
(a) There is a reasonably arguable case of error in the primary
(b) There is a reasonable prospect that the Appellant will obtain substantive
(c) Leave is needed to correct a substantial injustice caused by some
(d) There is a question of general importance upon which further argument, and a
decision of the Appeal Tribunal, would be to the
The grounds of appeal
matter determined by Adjudicator Murphy on 4 December 2024 involved a
residential apartment located near the Mater Hospital,
and complaints by the
tenant about helicopter noise from the hospital helipad disrupting her quiet
enjoyment of the premises, resulting
in her issuing a Notice to Remedy Breach
(RTA form 11) on 13 May 2024; and subsequently, on 20 May 2024, a Notice of
Intention to
Leave (RTA form 13). The learned Adjudicator accepted the validity
of the form 13 and refused the Applicants’ claim for rent
beyond 27 May
2024, allowing only the claim for a cleaning fee of
Applicants now express their grounds of appeal in the following terms:
Error in Law – Acceptance of Notice to Remedy Breach
The adjudicator wrongly accepted the Notice to Remedy Breach (13/05/2024) for
helicopter noise, which is beyond the landlord’s
control and not a breach
of the RTRA Act.
Error in Fact – Acceptance of Notice of Intention to Leave
The adjudicator incorrectly accepted the Notice of Intention to Leave
(27/05/2024) based on an unremedied breach. Helicopter noise
was not a valid
breach, nor was the landlord at fault.
Failure to Consider Lease Obligations & Compensation
The adjudicator failed to recognise that the tenant had a fixed-term lease until
21/02/2025 and improperly classified the termination.
The tenant should be
liable for $3,814.72 in compensation for loss of rent and reletting costs.
Decision Contrary to Law & Evidence
The 04/12/2024 decision ignored evidence that the tenant was not entitled to
terminate the lease due to an unremedied breach, resulting
in financial loss to
the landlord.
Grounds of Appeal Elaborated
[10] Subsequently,
in submissions filed before the Appeal Tribunal by the Applicants on 12
September 2025, the Applicants submit that:
(a) Although
and (2) of the
Residential Tenancies and Rooming
Accommodation Act 2008
(Qld) (‘RTRA Act’) require that a lessor
take reasonable steps to ensure the tenant has quiet enjoyment of the premises
and not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort and privacy of a tenant in
using the premises, the fact of noise emanating from
a nearby hospital helipad
is not an act or omission of the lessor capable of any remedy or a matter
affording any basis for a tenant
to issue a Notice to Remedy Lessor’s
Breach under s 301 of the RTRA Act. Consequently, the Applicants submit that
the learned
Adjudicator also fell into error for accepting the tenants Notice of
Intention to Leave dated 27 May 2024.
(b) The learned Adjudicator fell into error for having failed to consider the
tenant’s fixed-term obligations, claiming that
s 277 of the RTRA Act
provides that such agreements may only end in specific ways, including that a
written agreement has been made
to end it as between landlord and tenant (s
277(2)) or if a Tribunal makes an order terminating the agreement (s 277(5)(a)).
(c) During the hearing below, the Respondent tenant had raised mental health
concerns as a reason for vacating, yet these do not
form specific grounds for
early termination, as set out in the RTRA Act in ss 302, 305 or 308–310.
(d) The learned Adjudicator fell into error for having not made an order for
compensation in the sum of $3,814.72 to the Applicants
under s 420(1)(e) of the
Respondent’s Contentions
submissions received by the Appeal Tribunal on 6 October 2025 the Respondent
submits (here paraphrasing):
(a) The Lessor’s duty to ensure the Tenant’s quiet enjoyment extends
beyond refraining from deliberate interference,
and also requires that a
landlord investigate any conditions within their control that substantially
interfere with a tenant’s
peace and comfort.
(b) When the Respondent complained in March 2024 about severe noise and
vibration from helicopters landing at the hospital, the building
manager refused
to inspect the apartment and investigate whether triple-glazing fitted in other
apartments in the complex was either
missing, or defective, in this
(c) Section 185 of the RTRA Act requires the lessor to ensure that the premises
are fit for habitation, and that the premises remain
in good repair. Therefore,
the Applicants’ failure to inspect the apartment, in light of the
Respondent’s complaint
(d) Failure by the Applicants to respond to the form 11 Notice to Remedy Breach
meant that the Respondent was thereafter entitled
to issue a Form 13 Notice of
Intention to Leave. The learned Adjudicator had found that the Form 13 was
(e) The Applicants’ arguments in relation to the effect of s 277 of the
RTRA Act are not to the point, because one of the ways
in which a residential
tenancy agreement may be brought to an end is by way of an order of the
Tribunal. Here, the learned Adjudicator
had found that the Notice of Intention
to Leave had been validly issued, and terminated the agreement.
(f) The learned Adjudicator having considered the impact of helicopter noise on
the mental health of the Respondent was relevant
to an assessment of
habitability for purposes of s 185 of the RTRA Act, and does not amount to an
error of law.
(g) The Applicants’ claims for unpaid rent and re-letting costs overlook
that the power to order compensation (RTRA Act s 420(1)(e))
is discretionary.
The learned Adjudicator correctly exercised the discretion not to order
compensation, in circumstances in which
the Applicants were found to have been
in breach of s 183 and s 185 of the RTRA Act.
Appeal Tribunal Consideration
[12] In oral
reasons given on 4 December 2024, the learned Adjudicator said:
She [the Respondent] soon found out that the helicopter traffic to the Mater
Hospital was such that it was impacting her sleep patterns
and her mental
health, and she did eventually raise this with the applicant. The applicant did
nothing to actually validate her
concerns or her complaints about the noise and
was instructed by the owner not to do anything in relation to that matter.
...it seems to me that she validly signed a Form 13, which raised an issue which
would, in my view, require the owner to look at
the issue of the right of a
tenant to have peace – a peaceful – occupy the premises in such a
way as it wouldn’t
be disturbed by that sort of a noise on a regular
basis. The lessor could’ve, for instance, have looked at the issue of
the apartment or the location of the apartment or some further
improvements could be done in relation to the complaint made by the
respondent.
The agents did nothing in that regard at all.
It seems to me that – therefore that the respondent has given a valid form
of notice, which means that the claim for rent past
to be refused. On the basis of the material placed before me, I find that the
applicant is entitled to a cleaning fee
of $302.50. So, the orders will be that
the RTA is to pay the sum of 302.50 to the applicant, and the remainder to the
respondent.
Thank you, ladies.
[13] Although
reasons given by the learned Adjudicator at the immediate
conclusion of the hearing are very brief, these are nonetheless
accepting the very
practical strictures imposed on Adjudicators in a busy, high-volume jurisdiction
such as minor civil disputes.
To this end, in
Smart State Vehicle Rental Pty
Ltd v Tri Asset Protection Systems Pty Ltd
ex-QCAT President Justice Wilson
In the Tribunal’s minor civil disputes jurisdiction, giving immediate oral
reasons accords with the spirit and purpose of the
QCAT Act. The Appeal
Tribunal should be slow to criticise oral reasons for decision without
acknowledging the circumstances in which
they are given, or the pressure of the
learned Magistrate’s
[14] From the
reasons excerpted, it is sufficiently clear to the Appeal Tribunal that the
learned Adjudicator accepted that the Applicants
were dismissive of the
Respondent’s Form 11 noise complaint, without any efforts at investigation
to ascertain whether any
noise attenuation features within the unit were
sufficient for purposes of their lawful obligations arising under s 183(1) and s
185(2)(b) and (c) of the RTRA Act. Having ignored the Form 11, it is further
clear that the learned Adjudicator determined that
the Respondent had grounds to
issue the Form 13 Notice of Intention to Leave, and that the form 13 was
‘valid’. The
learned Adjudicator was always entitled to form that
view. To have done so does not constitute legal error.
Applicants’ arguments regarding the effect of s 277 of the RTRA are
entirely misconceived. Although s 277 of the RTRA
Act once had subsections such
as s 277(2) and s 277(5)(a) as now relied upon by the Applicants, s 277 of the
RTRA Act in that form
was repealed by
Housing Legislation
Amendment Act 2021
which received Royal assent as long ago now as 20 October 2021. Since that
date, the operative
277 have provided:
of residential tenancy agreements
A residential tenancy agreement ends only in 1 of the following ways—
(a) the lessor and tenant agree, in a separate written document, to end the
residential tenancy agreement;
(b) the lessor gives the tenant a notice to leave under section 326 and the
tenant hands over vacant possession of the premises on
or before the handover
day for the notice;
(c) the tenant gives the lessor a notice of intention to leave under section 327
and hands over vacant possession of the premises
on or before the handover day
for the notice;
(d) if there is only 1 tenant for the agreement—
(i) the tenant gives the lessor a notice ending tenancy interest, and hands over
vacant possession of the premises, in accordance
with division 3, subdivision
(ii) the tenant dies;
See section 324A in relation to the death of a sole tenant.
(e) the tenant vacates, or is removed from, the premises after receiving a
notice from a mortgagee or appointed person under section
(f) the tenant abandons the premises and the period for which the tenant has
paid rent has ended;
See division 8 for alternative procedures the lessor needs to follow in relation
to abandonment of the premises.
(g) the tribunal makes an order terminating the agreement.
See division 6 for the making of termination orders by the tribunal.
[16] Again, it
is sufficiently clear from the circumstances that, by his having accepted the
validity of the Form 13, the learned
Adjudicator has accepted the ending of the
residential tenancy agreement arose under s 277(c) – by the Respondent
tenant giving
the lessor a notice of intention to leave under s 327 and handing
over vacant possession of the premises on or before the handover
day for the
notice. Having made that finding, and because the awarding of compensation
under s 420(1)(e) is discretionary, the learned
Adjudicator was entitled not to
award any compensation for loss of rent or to defray any re-letting fee. Had
the tenant left the
premises early on invalid grounds the outcome may have been
Bricks 2 Pty Ltd v Averill & Anor
, Member Dr J R Forbes
Applications for leave to appeal are not occasions for a retrial on the merits,
but rather are reviews for reasonably arguable errors
of law. No such error is
apparent here. No error of law occurs simply because the judge prefers one
version of evidence to another.
Reasonable minds may differ, but that is not a
proper ground of appeal. It is not the function of a tribunal of appeal to
its own view for reasonable findings of a primary judge, even if
disposed to do so.
Disposition
[18] In this
case there is no reasonably arguable case of legal error in the primary
decision. The Applicants do not have any reasonable
prospect of obtaining
substantive relief if leave to appeal were now to be granted. No substantial
injustice caused by some error,
or any question of general importance now
warranting further argument and a further decision by the Appeal Tribunal for
benefit can be discerned by the Appeal Tribunal.
Application for leave to appeal is refused.
