REASONS FOR DECISION
[1] Complete
Prospecting Pty Ltd has applied for the grant of prospecting licences
P 20/2532 and P 20/2536, each of which the State
of Western Australia
considers to be an act attracting the expedited procedure under the
Yugunga-Nya
Native Title Aboriginal
Corporation RNTBC, being the relevant native title party, objects to the
application of the expedited procedure.
Tribunal’s role is to conduct an inquiry and determine whether or not the
expedited procedure applies:
Native Title Act
hearing from the parties at a conference on 20 February 2025, I made directions
for the conduct of an inquiry in both matters.
Yugunga-Nya’s contentions
and evidence were initially due on 22 April 2025, but the due date was later
extended by request
to 20 May 2025.
[3] Yugunga-Nya
did not comply by 20 May 2025, nor did it seek any further extension of time. On
27 May 2025, the Tribunal advised
the parties that the applications were at risk
of dismissal and allowed Yugunga-Nya until 3 June 2025 to provide reasons for
failure to comply and request any further time. On 23 June 2025, following a
change in representative for Yugunga-Nya, the Tribunal
informed the parties that
no comments had been received and advised that the applications had been
referred to me to consider dismissal.
No response was received.
[4] The Tribunal
may dismiss an objection application at any stage of the inquiry in
circumstances where the native title party fails
within a reasonable time to
proceed with the application or to comply with a direction of the Tribunal:
Native Title Act
I am satisfied on the facts of these matters
that each of Yugunga-Nya’s applications should be dismissed.
expedited procedure objection applications in relation to P 20/2532 and P
20/2536 are dismissed under
Native Title
