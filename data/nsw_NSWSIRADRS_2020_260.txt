Merit Reviewer’s Reasons for Determination
Claimant, ARH, was injured as a pedestrian in a motor accident on 24 January
2020 at Rathmines, NSW. There was a dispute between
the Insurer and the
Claimant in respect of the amount of weekly payments of statutory benefits
payable to him under Division 3.3
Motor Accidents Injuries Act
2017 (weekly payments of statutory benefits to injured
17 July 2020 QBE advised the Claimant that his Pre-Accident Weekly Earning
(PAWE) rate was $251.75 gross (the original decision).
On 20 July 2020 the
Claimant’s legal representative requested an internal review of that
original decision stating that the
Claimant’s PAWE rate should be $545.63
gross per week. A copy of the Claimant’s income tax return
(1/7/2018-30/6/2019)
was submitted with that request.
Insurer conducted an internal review of the original decision and on 4 August
2020 issued a Certificate of Determination varying
the original decision of 17
July 2020. The Claimant’s weekly payments of statutory benefits were
calculated on the basis that
his PAWE rate is $262.33 (varied up from $251.75).
The Insurer set out that the following documents were considered in the internal

$262.33 gross per week.
The revised PAWE figure I have determined, $262.33, will be used to
calculate your
weekly benefit entitlements.
Determination and Next Steps
The original decision is varied:
• You are entitled to a PAWE of $262.33 gross per week.
internal review decision increased the rate of Pre-Accident Weekly Earnings
benefits payable to the Claimant to $262.33 gross
per week. The Insurer
determined the decision had effect from 4 August 2020.
Claimant disputed the PAWE rate of $262.33 in the Insurer’s decision of 4
August 2020 and lodged an application for Merit
Review with SIRA’s Dispute
Resolution Service on 7 August 2020. The application was made in accordance
with section 7.12(1)
of the Act and the
Motor Accident Guidelines
(the Guidelines).
Documents and Information
have considered the documents provided in the application and the
Insurer’s response and any further information provided
by the parties.
This includes the Claimant’s written submissions dated 7 August 2020 and
accompanying annexed documents, as
well as the Insurer’s Reply dated 14
August 2020 and any attachments.
Submissions
Claimant submits as follows (in part):
“Submissions
7. Schedule 1, clause 4 (1) of the Motor Accident Guidelines
(‘MAG’) defines
pre-accident weekly earnings as:
“... the average of the gross earnings
earner as an
earner during the 12 months immediately before the day on which
motor accident occurred...”
[emphasis added]
8. The subject accident occurred on 24 January 2020, thus the insurer is
required to look at the claimant’s earnings for the period between 24
2019 to 23 January 2020.
9. The claimant was involved in a work-related accident on 14 June 2019.
to this injury, he was deemed unfit to work.
10. The most recent payslip in the claimant’s possession is dated 19
The claimant has not worked since this date.
11. In accordance with the MAG, the average of the claimant’s earnings
January 2019 and 19 July 2019 is to be calculated.
12. The claimant refers to the payslips annexed hereto and labelled
indicate the claimant’s earning during this time.
13. The claimant’s gross earnings for the period between 24 January
July 2019 is $13,640.75.
14. The insurer is required to calculate the
of the gross
by the earner in the year immediately preceding the
motor vehicle
15. The claimant was an earner for only 25 weeks of the year immediately
preceding the subject accident. Therefore, in order to calculate the average
an income earned over 25 weeks, the figure is to be divided by 25, being
period during which he received any earnings.
16. The insurer has made a significant error in their calculation to obtain
average figure, which has resulted in a PAWE that is effectively only half
what it should be.
17. The insurer recognises that the claimant did not earn an income after 19
2019, however instead of isolating that period of time from the entire 12
months pre-accident period, they have divided the claimant’s earnings
almost 6 months, by a whole year.
18. The insurer has made a material error in their calculation of the
19. Had the calculation been carried out correctly, the claimant’s PAWE
as follows:
$13,640.75 ÷ 25 = $545.63 gross per week.
20. Therefore, the claimant is entitled to a PAWE of $545.63 gross per
21. Accordingly, it is respectfully submitted that the insurer has made a
significant
error in their calculation, and that respectfully the DRS is empowered to
revise the insurers decision.
22. The claimant’s legal representatives seek the maximum regulated
this application.” ...
Insurer’s written submissions in Reply are set out (in part)
“... The claimant has failed to produce evidence of earnings for the
6-month period immediately preceding the motor accident,
but has confirmed
supplying all payslips for the 52 weeks preceding the motor vehicle accident.
The insurer submits that the claimant's
PAWE should be calculated using an
average of earnings for the 52 weeks preceding the motor vehicle accident. This
has been affirmed
by QBE's internal review specialist.
We note that all documentation relevant to the dispute has been supplied with
the application.”

conducting the Merit Review, I have considered the various submissions or

their written submissions.

Guidelines (the Guidelines).
find the dispute for Merit Review is a reviewable decision under Schedule
2(1)(a) of the Act.
regard to the circumstances of this case and the various payslips provided and
the 2019 Income Tax return relating to the Claimant,
I accept that for the
purposes of calculation of PAWE, the Claimant is
‘an earner who was
injured as a result of a motor accident’
at least for part of the
material period discussed further below.
I have considered the basis for
calculation of the weekly average of the gross earnings received by the Claimant
as an earner during
the relevant period spanning 12 months immediately before
the day on which the accident occurred on 24 January 2020 (the material
Insurer has assessed the Claimant’s income based on the gross earnings
received between 17 January 2019 and 19 July 2019
with reference to the
Claimant’s payslips provided. The total earnings for this period were
$13,641.25. I rely on the actual
payslips provided in preference to the 2019
Income Tax return which covers some earnings outside of the material period. In
Reply, the Insurer submits that the Claimant failed to produce evidence of
earnings for the 6-month period immediately preceding
the motor accident but did
confirm supplying all his payslips for the 52 weeks immediately prior to the
motor vehicle accident.
This covers the period 23 January 2019 to 23 January
2020. The Insurer considers that the Claimant's PAWE should be calculated using
an average of earnings for the 52 weeks preceding the motor vehicle accident.
The Insurer therefore, made the calculation by dividing
the total earnings of
$13,641.25 by 52 weeks to derive the PAWE figure of $262.33 gross (as varied up)
on the internal review.
Pre-Accident
Weekly Earnings (PAWE) is defined by clause 4, Schedule 1 of the Act.
Sub-clauses 1 and 2 are in the following terms:
1) Pre-accident
weekly earnings, in relation to an earner who is injured as a result of a motor
accident, means the weekly average
of the gross earnings received by an earner
as an earner during the 12 months immediately before the day on which the motor
occurred, unless subclause (2) applies.
2) In the following cases, pre-accident weekly earnings, in relation to
an earner (other than a self-employed person) who is injured
as a result of a
motor accident, means:
(a) If, on the day of the motor accident, the earner was earning
continuously, but had not been earning continuously for at least
12 months - the
weekly average of the gross earnings received by the earner as an earner during
the period from when the earner started
to earn continuously to immediately
before the day of the motor accident,
(a1) If the earner was employed or self-employed during a period or
periods equal to at least 26 weeks during the first year of the
pre-accident
period, but was not obtaining earnings from any source at any other time during
the pre-accident period - the average
weekly gross earnings received by the
earner as an earner during the first year of the pre-accident period,
(b) If subclause (3) applies - the weekly average of the gross earnings
received by the earner as an earner during the period from
when the change of
circumstance referred to in that subclause occurred to immediately before the
day of the motor accident,
(c) If the earner is an earner by reason of having entered into an
arrangement with an employer or other person to undertake employment
commence business as a self-employed person - the average weekly gross earnings
that the earner could reasonable have been
expected to earn, but for the injury,
in employment under that arrangement.
4, Schedule 1 of the Act is construed such that earnings from self-employment do
not attract the exceptions listed in subclause
Claimant’s payslips demonstrate that he earned $13,641 from his work with
Judy Stahmer Tiling during the material period
of 12 months prior to the motor
accident. Although the period for these payments is submitted as commencing
from 17 January 2019
and extending to 19 July 2019, I note the first payslip
provided is dated 23 January 2019. This payslip covers the pay period, 17
January 2019 to 23 January 2019 inclusive. I therefore, accept the payslip
dated 23 January 2019 falls within the relevant 12-month
period immediately
before the day of the motor accident on 24 January 2020 (being 23 January 2019
to 23 January 2020). The last payslip
is dated 19 July 2019 being 25 weeks and 3
days after the date of the first payslip of 23 January 2019. Accordingly, I
payslips cover an aggregate period of earnings of less than 26 weeks as
submitted by the Claimant.
is no evidence before me of any other earnings in the material 12-month period
before the motor accident from any other source.
I note the submission that the
Claimant has confirmed supplying all payslips relating to the 52 weeks
immediately prior to the motor
accident. Accordingly, I am satisfied the total
gross earnings received by the Claimant as an earner during the relevant period
immediately
before the day on which the accident occurred is $13,641 (rounded to
the nearest whole dollar). I find this covered the period of
25 weeks (to the
nearest whole week) during the material 12-months before the motor
point of difference regarding the calculation of PAWE between the parties is
that the Insurer has averaged the Claimant’s
gross earnings over 52 weeks
to derive PAWE of $262.33 whereas, the Claimant submits the gross earnings
should be averaged over 25
weeks for a PAWE figure of $545.63. I accept that
Clause 4(2)(a1) of Schedule 1 of the Act does not apply here as the Claimant was
not employed during a period or periods equal to at least 26 weeks in the 12
months immediately before the motor accident.
Claimant’s written submissions state that he was an earner for only 25
weeks of the year immediately preceding the subject
accident. His submission is
that in order to calculate the average of weekly income earned over 25 weeks,
the figure of $13,641 (rounded)
is to be divided by 25, being the period during
which he received earnings, as an earner, not 52 weeks.
is common ground that the Claimant did not earn income after 19 July 2019. I
note the submission that the Claimant was involved
in a work-related accident on
14 June 2019 and that due to this injury, he was deemed unfit to work and has
not worked after that
have considered the definition of Pre-Accident Weekly Earnings relevant to the
Claimant’s particular circumstances. Schedule
Motor Accident
Injuries Act 2017
provides the definitions relating to earnings for the
purposes of calculating weekly payments.
the calculation, Clause 4(2)(a) of Schedule 1 applies to particular
circumstances where a person had not been working continuously
over at least the
12 months immediately before the motor accident. In these circumstances PAWE
“if, on the day of the motor accident, the earner
was earning continuously, but had not been earning continuously for at least
months - the weekly average of the gross earnings received by the earner as an
earner during the period from when the earner started
to earn continuously to
immediately before the day of the motor accident.”
this has no application in the circumstances of this case, because the Claimant
was not earning continuously on the day of
the motor accident given no evidence
of any income earned after 19 July 2019 because he had ceased working.
Relevantly,
Schedule 1, Clause 4 (1) defines PAWE as
“... the average of the gross
earnings received by the earner as an earner during the 12 months immediately
before the day on
which the motor accident occurred ...”
The Claimant
emphasises the reference to earnings
as an earner, so as to
average his gross earnings over the 25 weeks worked in the material 12-month
basis of calculation of the gross earnings received over the period
, requires the Claimant to satisfy the definition of
‘earner’. Schedule 1, Clause 2 defines a person (of at least 15
years of age) as an ‘
’ if the person (i) ‘
employed or self-employed (whether or not full-time) ... at any time during the
8 weeks immediately preceding the motor accident’
(cl.(2)(a)(i)) which
is not the case here; or where (ii)
during a period or periods
equal to at least 13 weeks during the year immediately preceding the motor
at the date of the motor accident, had not retired
permanently from all employment:
(cl.(2)(a)(ii)).
is nothing before me to suggest the Claimant had retired permanently from all
employment as at the date of the motor accident.
There is also no evidence
presented that the Claimant continued on in employment after he ceased work from
19 July 2019, but what
is clear is that he received no income after that time to
the date of the motor accident injury, sustained on 24 January 2020.
find the Claimant worked at least 13 weeks during the year immediately preceding
the motor accident. I accept therefore, under cl.(2)(a)(ii))
of Schedule 1, the
Claimant was an earner when he was working and that for a period, he received
gross earnings
as an earner
during the 12 months immediately before the
accept the Claimant’s written submissions at paragraph 15, that in his
case, he was an earner for only 25 weeks of the year
immediately preceding the
accident. As the last employment payslip is dated 19 July 2019 with no evidence
of any ongoing earnings
after that time, it follows that the Claimant’s
gross earnings were earnings received by him as an earner for 25 weeks during
the material 52 weeks before the accident. For this reason, unless the Claimant
satisfies an exception under the legislation, I will
average his earnings over
the period he received gross earnings,
as an earner
, being 25 weeks.
none of the exceptions in sub-clause 4(2) apply for reasons already discussed
above, the Claimant’s PAWE is calculated on
the basis of the weekly
average of the gross earnings received by him as an earner, during the 12 months
immediately before the day
on which the motor accident occurred (Schedule 1,
sub-clause 4(1)). Having regard to the wording adopted by the section and the
actual language employed, I have concluded the relevant period over which the
earnings are to be averaged is the aforementioned 25
weeks of gross earnings the
as an earner
the material
12-month period. This is the approach in
AAC v NRMA Insurance
NSWDRS MR 003 (formerly Merit Review MA02/18) in relation to the earner’s
earnings, which at paragraph 14, posits adopting:
The ordinary and
grammatical sense of the words in this provision ...
interpretation of the provision must be within the confines of the
actual language employed.”
Accordingly,
I conclude the correct or preferable decision is to average the Claimant’s
gross earnings of $13,641 attained during
the 12-month period immediately before
the day of the motor accident by the 25 weeks he was earning the gross earnings
as an earner.
The sum of $13,641 / 25 weeks equates to $545.64 per week. I find
the Claimant is entitled to Pre-Accident Weekly Earnings (PAWE)
at the rate of
$545.64 gross per week.
Accordingly,
the reviewable decision is set aside and remitted to the Insurer for
reconsideration in accordance with the findings

Claimant was represented by legal practitioners in these proceedings. Under
section 8.10
Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017
a Claimant for
statutory benefits is (subject to that section) entitled to recover from the
Insurer against whom the claim is made,
the reasonable and necessary legal
costs, and other costs and expenses, incurred by the Claimant in connection with
the claim. Other
costs and expenses may include cost of medical and other tests
and reports. However,
section 8.10
only permits payment of these legal costs
incurred as follows:
The Dispute Resolution Service
can permit payment of legal costs incurred by a claimant but only if satisfied
(a) the claimant is under a legal disability, or
(b) exceptional circumstances exist that justify payment of legal
costs incurred by the claimant.
note the Claimant’s legal representatives seek the maximum regulated costs
for this application. There is no dispute presented
between the Claimant and the
Insurer in respect of recovery of legal costs under section 8.10 of the Act.
There is no submission
that the Claimant is under a legal disability or that
exceptional circumstances exist that justify legal costs incurred in this case,
beyond regulated costs.
Accordingly,
I make no order as to costs, but note the Claimant seeks the maximum regulated
costs for this application.
Determination
My determination of the Merit Review is as follows:
