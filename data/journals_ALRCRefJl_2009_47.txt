Appealing to the Future Michael Kirby and his Legacy
Edited by Ian Freckelton and Hugh Selby Reviewed by Rosalind Croucher
This mega-tome was published to coincide with the 70th birthday of the Hon
Michael Kirby AC CMG on 2 February 2009, the day he retired
from the High Court
of Australia. Co-edited by Ian Freckelton and Hugh Selby, the book contains 35
chapters, preceded by an introductory
chapter as well as a preamble; a prefatory
tribute; notes about each of the 43 contributors; a lengthy index; an extensive
bibliography;
and eight pages of photographs.
The book’s intended audience is a broad one, and its object, as Selby
remarks, is to present Justice Kirby and his ideas ‘through
lenses’. Selby’s preamble begins: ‘None of us can be all
things to all men but a select few can set an example
that inspires the rest of
us. Michael Kirby is such a man.’
With such an opening there
may be an anticipation that one was about to read a collection in the style of a
hagiography—the
life of a saint. As the co-editor, Freckelton, says in his
introductory chapter, rather that they had ‘done [their] best to
adulatory and the sycophantic’, while also acknowledging that ‘there
are many in this volume who are unfeigned
admirers of Kirby’.
The preamble provides a guide to reading the edited essays. Given the
daunting task of having to review the collection—because
of its size, its
subject, and the aura which surrounded the timing of its appearance—I was
rather glad to see ‘sat-nav’
like directions as to how to proceed.
This I followed dutifully, except that two chapters were not referred to at
The arrangement of the chapters puzzled me nonetheless and it
was only when I had almost fi nished this review that I realised—of
course, it was alphabetical! On refl ection, perhaps the chapters could have
been grouped differently, so that one could read sequentially,
or in themed
sections. There are included in the contributors—as many authors freely
admit—many fans. But many chapters
do include a critical eye, especially
the large set of chapters that examine Kirby J’s judgments in particular
areas of law.
These chapters, in the main, exhibit a clear, critical, albeit
often still affectionate or admiring, eye and form the core of the
book. While
the chapters examining various slices of ‘Kirby jurisprudence’ are
quite formal, as would be expected, the
style of others, in contrast, is more
anecdotal, or interlaced with amusing stories.
Kirby’s contributions to law reform—he was the foundation Chair
of the Australian Law Reform Commission from 1975 until
recurring theme and highlighted in particular in the impressive chapter by David
Weisbrot (the current President
of the ALRC), ‘Law Reform,
Australian-Style’;
Murray Wilcox’s short refl ective
note on ‘The Law Reformer’;
in CG Weeramantry’s
chapter, ‘The Internationalist’;
and in the section of
Freckelton’s introductory chapter dubbed ‘Kirby the
What is clearly evident through the pages of this vast work are the many
intersections that Justice Kirby has had with so many people,
in so many walks
of life, over his lifetime, and his great courtesy and its effect on individuals
and institutions. The impact Kirby
had as President of the Court of Appeal of
New South Wales is particularly mentioned in David Ipp’s chapter on
‘Intermediate
Appellate Judges’
Barker’s witty chapter on ‘Judicial Practice’ and his
celebration of ‘the phenomenon of tea and
raisin toast’ as a means
of building collegiality and consensus among his fellow judges.
There are a few typos in the book, mostly forgivable in a work of this size
and its obviously immovable publication deadline. The
repetition of certain
elements of Michael Kirby’s life and judgments is also not surprising for
the same reasons. A case table
is a useful addition in this regard so that the
reader can fi nd each occasion an author has reviewed or mentioned the same
The book is written and titled as an ‘appeal to the future’,
the nature of which is captured
‘Kirby’s thinking is guided by an unshakeable conviction that
human dignity and human rights are the gravitational centre
of any civilised
society; and that a legal system which escapes the insistent pull of human
rights will produce law without justice.
Kirby is writing for a future which
honours that role of law in society. ‘His appeal to the future ages will
come ... from
that central idea. His place in history will depend in part on
whether or not we acknowledge the centrality of human rights in our
law. That idea provokes hostility in some quarters and indifference in others.
It is by no means certain that we will end
up with a legal system based on the
notion that law should produce a just result consistent with the principles of
human rights.
‘If Michael Kirby writes for the future, it is a future I would wish to
share. It may be diffi cult to attain. But he has shown
us the way, and he has
shown that it is worth striving for.’
In so far as the editors seek to present ‘Michael Kirby and his
ideas’ through many lenses, they have accomplished their
goal with great
distinction. It is a monumental achievement and the book is indeed a rich read.
It will provide an excellent resource
particularly for those fascinated by the
jurisprudence of the High Court, on which it provides a very distinct and
distinctive lens.
