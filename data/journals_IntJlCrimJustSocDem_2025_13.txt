Societies emerging from periods of mass violence
and repression face profound challenges in addressing the legacies of their
Over the last few decades, fields like transitional justice and human
rights have developed robust frameworks to confront historical
injustices, from
truth commissions and war crimes trials to reparations programmes and
memorialisation initiatives (Ketelaars, 2018;
Zschirnt & Menaldo, 2014).
Criminology, traditionally focused on crime and punishment in stable settings,
has increasingly turned
its gaze to these post-violence transitions (Fiedler
& Mross, 2023). This special issue,
Criminology in Post-Violence
Transitions: Exploring the Intersections between Human Rights, Grassroots
Activism, Transitional Justice,
Memory, and Criminology
, brings together 11
contributions which illuminate how criminological inquiry can enrich our
understanding of societies moving beyond
conflict and authoritarianism. Through
an academic yet accessible voice, the collection addresses a broad scholarly
audience about
the intersection of criminology with processes of justice,
memory, and social change in transitional contexts.
As guest editors, we situate this issue at the nexus of criminology and
transitional justice. We argue that criminology, with its
insights into the
causes of violence, the operation of justice systems, and the experiences of
victims and survivors, has much to
offer to the study of post-conflict
societies. Conversely, engaging with transitional contexts pushes criminology
beyond its traditional
bounds, demanding interdisciplinary approaches and a
willingness to centre voices and epistemologies often marginalised in mainstream
discourse. The contributions in this issue span diverse geographical regions and
cultural contexts, with a particular focus on the
Global South. Case studies
range from Latin America (Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Argentina) and Africa (The
Gambia, Nigeria, Cameroon,
South Africa) to Europe (Spain) and international
justice fora (the International Criminal Court). Each article reflects unique
realities, from Indigenous struggles in Colombia and Guatemala to
post-authoritarian memory struggles in Spain, Argentina, and The
Gambia, while
collectively speaking to universal themes of justice, accountability and healing
after violence.
Methodologically, the issue showcases how researchers are innovating to study
these transitions. Ethnographic fieldwork, participatory
research with victims
and activists, archival analysis of legal records and testimonies, and
interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks
(from feminist and decolonial theory to
social psychology and psychoanalysis) all feature prominently. The result is an
is empirically rich and conceptually bold, pushing the boundaries of
criminological research. In what follows, we first outline the
key thematic
intersections that frame the special issue. We then provide a detailed
discussion of the 11 articles, highlighting how
each contribution advances our
understanding of criminology’s role in post-violence transitions. Finally,
we conclude with
conceptual reflections and directions for future research,
considering how criminology can continue to engage with human rights,
activism, transitional justice and memory in the pursuit of a more just
post-violence world.
Thematic Framing: Intersections of Violence, Justice and Memory
In post-violence contexts, addressing past atrocities is not only a legal or
political challenge, but also a social, cultural, and
epistemological one
(Cohen, 2020; Gready & Robins, 2014; Hoddy, 2021). This special issue
engages with five key themes that emerge
at the intersection of criminology and
transitional justice. The first is concerned with
the legacies of violence
and the politics of memory
; the shadow of past violence looms large in
transitional and post-conflict societies (Briony, 2021). The call of
“Nunca Más”
(“Never Again”) that emerged
in Latin America encapsulates a commitment to prevent the recurrence of
atrocities by remembering
and learning from the past. Memory is a double-edged
sword: it can be a tool of empowerment and truth-telling or, conversely, a site
of contestation when powerful actors seek to deny or distort history (Tamayo
Gomez, 2022a). Several contributions in this issue examine
how societies
remember mass violence, through truth commissions, oral histories,
commemorations, and archival efforts, and how these
memories inform justice.
Criminological perspectives on state crimes and victimisation enrich these
discussions, recognising that
what is remembered or forgotten can shape both
policy outcomes and community healing.
The second key theme addresses
grassroots activism and justice “from
. A recurrent thread in this special issue is the vital role of
civil society and grassroots movements in pursuing justice and reform
post-conflict settings. While states and international bodies often establish
formal transitional justice mechanisms, much of
the impetus for accountability
and change comes “from below”: survivors’ groups,
women’s associations, Indigenous
communities, and youth movements (Tamayo
Gomez, 2022b). Grassroots activism serves as a catalyst for truth recovery and
legal action,
especially when official processes fall short. The articles in
this special issue illustrate how community-based actors organise
to document
abuses, keep memories alive, and pressure authorities to act. By examining these
efforts, we see criminology intersecting
with social movement studies and
community justice, highlighting how social mobilisation can challenge impunity
and contribute to
safer, more just societies.
The third key theme presents
feminist and decolonial critiques
Post-violence transitions do not occur on a level epistemic playing field, power
dynamics of gender, race, and colonial history
profoundly shape whose justice is
prioritised. A number of contributions here apply feminist and decolonial lenses
to critique traditional
approaches to justice. Feminist perspectives draw
attention to sexual and gender-based violence, long under-acknowledged in war
atrocity narratives, and question whether conventional courts or truth
forums adequately address the needs of women and LGBTQ+ survivors
(Ketelaars,
2018). Decolonial approaches, similarly, question the dominance of Western legal
norms and highlight Indigenous and local
concepts of justice that may conflict
with state-centred models. By foregrounding these critiques, this special issue
interrogates
how transitional justice can be more inclusive and responsive to
those most marginalised, and how criminology can engage with alternative
knowledge systems (for example, Indigenous cosmologies or community dispute
resolution practices) in understanding harm and repair.
The fourth key theme engages with
challenges to state-centred justice
Many articles reveal the limitations of state-centric justice mechanisms in
delivering meaningful accountability and reconciliation.
Courts may prosecute a
few high-level perpetrators but fail to capture the broader structures of
violence; truth commissions may
document abuses yet lack the power to enforce
reparations or prosecutions. In some cases, states themselves become obstacles,
instituting
amnesties, or as seen recently, electing leaders who roll back
previous human rights gains (Roht-Arriaza & Mariezcurren, 2012).
Our special
issue highlights how state inaction or resistance often necessitates alternative
pathways: community tribunals, social
protest, artistic memorialisation, or
transnational advocacy. Criminologists are thus called to consider justice not
only in formal
institutions like courts and police, but also in informal,
hybrid, and insurgent forms of justice that arise in transitional periods.
The final key theme underpinning discussions is about
emerging approaches
to human rights in transitional contexts
. Some contributions point to
innovative approaches to human rights and justice emerging from transitional
contexts. These include
conceptual frameworks like transformative justice and
abolition feminism that seek to move beyond punitive paradigms; the use of
forensic science and archaeology as truth-telling tools in service of human
rights; and notions of human dignity, spiritual healing,
and community
rebuilding as integral parts of justice. Such approaches broaden the scope of
criminology and justice studies, integrating
mental health, ecology,
spirituality, and other dimensions into the conversation on what it means to
recover from violence. They
demonstrate a trend towards interdisciplinarity and
holistic understanding, recognising, for instance, that rebuilding social trust
or restoring dignity to victims can be as important as legal verdicts in a
transition out of violence (Moffett, 2023).
The thematic framing of the special issue underscores that criminology in
post-violence transitions is necessarily pluralistic and
critical. It must
account for historical harms and power imbalances, engage with actors beyond the
state, and remain adaptable to
emerging challenges and ideas. We move on now to
present the specific contributions of the special issue’s 11 articles,
how each exemplifies and enriches these themes.
Insights from the Special Issue Contributions
Truth, Memory and Grassroots Justice
One core focus of this special issue is how truth-seeking processes and
memory work unfold in transitional societies, often propelled
by those most
affected. In

Gambia’s Transitional Justice Process

powerful examination of a formal truth-seeking body, the Gambian Truth,
Reconciliation, and Reparations Commission (TRRC),
and the community activism

the disappeared in The Gambia navigated mourning and memory during and after the

as they ask,
“What is the Government going to do about these victims?” Post-TRRC,
with the commission’s hearings,
concluded victims’ relatives in The
Gambia found themselves asking “What next?”, and Ndow demonstrates
legacy of the TRRC will depend on sustained civil society advocacy to
carry forward its recommendations.
Drawing on critical theorists (Derrida, Ricoeur, Foucault, Arendt), Ndow
analyses how truth, power and collective memory interact
in the Gambian context.
The key argument, highly relevant to criminology, is that formal truth-telling
must be complemented by grassroots
activism and victim-centred approaches to
achieve justice. State-led efforts alone (especially ones without prosecutorial
as the TRRC lacked) are insufficient. This contribution highlights how
victims’ voices and community mobilisation become crucial
in holding the
state accountable to the Truth Commission’s findings and ensuring that the
truths uncovered translate into real
change. It situates criminology in dialogue
with transitional justice by centring the experiences of victims of state
violence and
showing how memory activism (families speaking out and preserving
the stories of atrocities) forms a foundation for ongoing justice
efforts in a
post-authoritarian transition.
Where formal mechanisms falter or leave gaps, informal initiatives often rise
to fill them, especially in the realm of truth recovery
and memory.
Transitional Justice and Forensic Exhumations: Reconciling Post-Conflict
Violence in Spain
by Natalia Maystorovich Chulio transports us to a very
different context, Spain, which nonetheless shares strikingly similar dynamics
of grassroots justice. Maystorovich Chulio examines the surge of mass grave
exhumations that have taken place in Spain in recent
years as a means of
confronting the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and
Francoist dictatorship. In Spain’s
transition to democracy after 1975, a
state policy of amnesia (enshrined in a 1977 Amnesty Law) meant that tens of
thousands of victims
of Franco’s repression remained buried in unmarked
graves, their stories suppressed. The article demonstrates how, decades
families of the disappeared and civil society associations spearheaded a social
movement to exhume the dead and reclaim historical
These exhumations, often initiated privately by victims’ families in
the absence of robust state action, have become acts of
grassroots transitional
justice. Maystorovich Chulio details how forensic specialists, together with
local communities, have collaborated
in open exhumation sites, blending
scientific methods with oral testimonies. This collaborative and transparent
process has allowed
families to actively participate in recovering their loved
one’s remains, thereby merging forensic truth with communal healing.
article compellingly argues that such bottom-up efforts serve a dual purpose: on
one hand, they produce evidence and historical
truth-telling about past
atrocities (even when formal courts are barred by amnesty laws); on the other,
they foster reconciliation
and acknowledgement by revising collective memory.
As regards criminology, this study is instructive in illustrating how justice
can be pursued outside the courtroom, and how forensic
science becomes a tool of
memory and human rights activism. It underscores the notion that, even in
so-called “established”
democracies like Spain, grassroots
initiatives, digging literally into the past, are crucial to reckon with
historical violence,
thereby complementing or substituting for state justice
processes. The Spanish case is a reminder that transitions can be long and
ongoing, requiring persistent societal efforts to achieve a measure of justice
Memory, Activism and Resistance Movements
Beyond formal truth institutions, this special issue highlights broader
social movements as carriers of memory and agents of justice.
Imaginations: Mnemonic Frames Against Extractivism in Guatemala
Masek Sánchez
, the focus shifts to post-conflict Guatemala, where the
scars of a decades-long civil war and genocide (culminating in the 1990s)
continue to influence contemporary struggles. Masek Sánchez’s
article explores an innovative concept of “temporal
imaginations”
the self-reflective, historical frames that Indigenous Maya Q’eqchi’
activists use to situate their
present-day environmental struggle in the
continuum of past injustices. Through 18 months of participant observation with
organisations (such as Defensoría Q’eqchí)
fighting against the Fénix nickel mining project, and dozens
interviews and testimonies from genocide survivors, the article reveals how
collective memory of past violence is weaponised as
a tool of resistance.
Indigenous activists in El Estor, Guatemala, draw direct parallels between
the current extractivist exploitation of their lands and
the legacies of settler
colonialism and state violence that their communities endured during the civil
war. By invoking memories
of historic injustices and framing their fight against
a mining company as part of a much longer struggle for dignity and autonomy,
they cement group loyalties, articulate grievances, and rally support across
generations. Masek Sánchez shows that these “temporal
imaginations” enable activists to project both backwards and forward in
time: they remember the brutalities of the past to
prevent their recurrence, and
they envision a future free from oppression.
For criminology, the Guatemalan case exemplifies how crime and conflict are
narrativised by communities in resistance, linking environmental
harms to prior
human rights violations. It also demonstrates the potency of memory as a
mobilising force, essentially, a form of
knowledge-power that grassroots
movements deploy against state and corporate impunity. This perspective broadens
criminological inquiry
to include not only the study of harms (such as
ecological destruction linked with violence) but also the study of how affected
communities
construct meaning and justice claims over time.
Collective memory and activism are also at the heart of
Social Movements
as Triggers of Transgenerational Transmission of Trauma and Memory in Chile
Karla Henríquez, Nicolás Pinochet, Geoffrey Pleyers, and
Fedra Cuestas
. This article delves into post-dictatorship Chile, nearly 50
years after the 1973 coup that ushered in the Pinochet regime. Chile’s
transition to democracy in 1990 did not immediately erase the deep traumas of
torture, disappearance and repression inflicted on
its people. Henríquez
and colleagues investigate how social movements in contemporary Chile serve as
conduits for processing
and transmitting the unresolved trauma of state terror
across generations. Moving beyond the work of dedicated human rights NGOs,
authors highlight the role of broader movements, student protests, feminist
rallies, and anti-neoliberal demonstrations, in reopening
and reframing
discussions about the dictatorial past.
Using qualitative data and interdisciplinary lenses from social psychology
and psychoanalysis, the article illustrates that within
these movements, spaces
often organically emerge where latent or “unspoken” trauma surfaces.
For example, young protesters
who did not directly experience the dictatorship
nonetheless inherit its memory through stories in their communities and the
symbols of protest, such as photographs of the disappeared held aloft in
marches. The authors pay particular attention to the gendered
dimension of
memory: women survivors of sexual political violence under Pinochet, whose
suffering was long marginalised as a “lesser”
form of torture, have
found in the feminist movements a platform to demand recognition of these
gender-specific atrocities. By articulating
silenced histories, such as rape and
sexual torture, within the context of contemporary gender equality struggles,
Chilean activists
link past and present, insisting that the personal and
political traumas of yesterday be acknowledged today. The article’s
findings underscore that Chilean society, decades on, is still indelibly shaped
by the violence of the dictatorship and that social
movements act as a vital
form of justice-seeking.
For the field of criminology, this work is a testament to the idea that the
aftermath of state crime is lived not only legally or
politically, but
culturally and psychosocially. The Chilean case encourages criminologists to
engage with concepts of collective
trauma and memory transmission, recognising
that social activism can function as an alternative mechanism of truth and
reparation,
one that operates in streets and public discourse, parallel to (and
sometimes in tension with) formal transitional justice measures.
A cautionary counterpoint to the positive power of memory activism is
provided by
Rosario Figari Layus
Never again? The
Institutionalisation of Far-Right Negationism and Shrinking Space in Argentina:
Impacts on Transitional Justice Trials
and Memory Politics
. Argentina has
long been seen as a transitional justice success story in Latin America: since
the return of democracy in 1983, it
pursued truth (the 1984 Nunca Más!
report), justice (extensive human rights trials for the 1976–1983
dictatorship’s
crimes), and memory (numerous memorials and
commemorations), largely due to the tireless efforts of human rights
organisations like
the Madres de Plaza de Mayo. Figari Layus’s article,
however, sounds an alarm about recent reversals in this hard-won progress.
With the rise of far-right political forces, exemplified by the election of
populist outsider Javier Milei in 2023, Argentina has
institutionalisation of negationist discourse at the highest levels of
government. This article documents how denial and
revisionism regarding the
dictatorship’s human rights abuses, once fringe, have moved into
mainstream policy: funding for human
rights institutions has been slashed,
public officials openly question the established historical truth of state
terrorism, and victim
groups face new stigmatisation and threats. Crucially,
Figari Layus illustrates that such rhetoric is not harmless speech, it has
“concrete consequences that undermine the functioning and scope of
transitional justice and memory actors and spaces”.
We see attempts to
obstruct ongoing trials of perpetrators, a reduction in public access to
archives and information, and the curtailing
of commemorative events and
activism through both formal means and intimidation. This Argentine experience
provides a sobering lesson
that transitional justice gains are not irreversible:
the progress made over decades can be eroded when political will shifts
dramatically.
For criminology, which often examines power dynamics and the politics of law
enforcement, this case highlights the importance of political
context in shaping
justice outcomes. The Argentine case urges scholars and practitioners to
consider how to safeguard truth and justice
processes against backlash, and how
to respond when the state itself becomes an agent of historical denial and
impunity. In a broader
sense, it reinforces one of the special issue themes: the
need for constant vigilance and sustained activism. Even in a country whose
slogan “Never again” became synonymous with transitional justice,
the struggle over memory and accountability continues,
reminding us that
post-violence transitions can face new waves of contestation long after the guns
have fallen silent.
Decolonising and Localising Justice
Several contributions examine transitions through the lens of local knowledge
systems and decolonisation, asking how post-violence
justice can become more
culturally attuned and emancipatory. In
Attempts from the Transitional
Justice in Strengthening Indigenous Justices in Colombia
Marcela Olarte Delgado
, the author confronts the interface between a formal,
state-led transitional justice process and Indigenous conceptions of justice.
Colombia’s peace process after its decades-long armed conflict (officially
ending with the 2016 peace accord with FARC guerrillas)
led to the creation of
the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), a transitional justice tribunal tasked
with addressing war crimes.
Olarte Delgado’s article critically examines
to what extent this mechanism has managed to strengthen Indigenous justice
in Colombia, or conversely, how it might perpetuate what she terms
“epistemic violence.” Indigenous peoples in Colombia,
communities most impacted by the armed conflict’s massacres, displacement,
and abuses, have their own ancestral forms
of justice and concepts of harm and
The article finds that while Colombia’s JEP has made efforts to
incorporate interculturality (for instance, by recognising Indigenous
authorities and considering ethnic perspectives in its proceedings), tensions
abound. Certain JEP legal orders and frameworks still
operate on Western
assumptions about wrongdoing and reparation, which can clash with Indigenous
ontologies of justice and reconciliation.
For example, Indigenous cosmologies
may see land, community harmony, and spiritual balance as central to justice,
which is not easily
translated into the JEP’s legalistic remedies. Olarte
Delgado demonstrates that “strengthening Indigenous justice is
on understanding its ontology”, meaning that the Colombian transitional
system can only truly support Indigenous
communities if it respects their ways
of defining and resolving harm. This might require decolonising the legal
process itself: allowing
space for Indigenous law (perhaps through autonomous
Indigenous justice processes running in parallel to the JEP) and ensuring that
transitional justice does not inadvertently impose the very colonial logic that
marginalised Indigenous peoples in the first place.
The argumentation put forward in this Colombian case is a vivid example of
the need to expand our concept of justice beyond the state
Eurocentric norms within the field of criminology. Olarte Delgado invites
criminologists to engage with legal pluralism
and to consider how formal justice
systems interact with community-based justice in post-conflict societies. The
article also resonates
with broader calls to decolonise criminology by valuing
Indigenous and local epistemologies when analysing crime, victimisation,
What Do We Do With all This Dying?”: South African Time,
Space, and Place in Forensic Evidence
Robyn Gill-Leslie
, the focus
on local epistemologies takes a different form, through an exploration of how
cultural conceptions of time and place intersect
with forensic practices in the
aftermath of violence. Gill-Leslie examines the Marikana Commission of Inquiry
in South Africa, which
investigated the tragic 2012 Marikana massacre (where
police shot and killed dozens of striking mineworkers). This article is
distinctive
in weaving in a theoretical gesture of ukwakumkanya, a term drawn
from an Indigenous (isiXhosa or related) concept meaning, in context,
bring light” or enlightenment, framed through transcorporeality (the idea
that bodies, living or dead, are interconnected
with their environment and
social context).
By analysing medico-legal evidence from the commission with these lenses,
Gill-Leslie surfaces how forensic truth is not purely universal
and scientific,
but also local and relational. International human rights norms often emphasise
universal “rights” such
as the right to dignity in death or the
right for families to know the fate of their loved ones. While crucial,
Gill-Leslie argues
that focusing only on such universal frames can occlude local
understandings of death and justice. In the Marikana case, forensic
ballistics, autopsy reports, and crime scene reconstructions, did more than
serve legal accountability; it became part
of a narrative that communities used
to make sense of loss. The article shows that South African notions of time and
space, rooted
in the country’s specific historical and cultural landscape,
offer alternative interpretations of forensic findings: For instance,
communities understand the transformation of the body after death, or the
spiritual significance of the place where someone dies,
can imbue forensic
evidence with different meanings than a court-centric view would.
Moreover, Gill-Leslie points out that empowering local communities to engage
with forensic processes can challenge the state’s
monopoly on truth
production. In Marikana’s aftermath, there were efforts by activists and
victims’ families to bring
in independent pathologists and to question
official narratives, reflecting a desire to reclaim the truth process. For
criminologists,
this piece is a reminder that evidence and truth are not
objective facts revealed in a vacuum; they are interpreted through cultural
frames. It urges criminology to integrate perspectives from anthropology and
indigenous knowledge when examining forensic and investigative
practices in
post-violence settings. In essence, justice after atrocity must account for
multiple realities, the legal-scientific
reality and the lived cosmological
reality of communities, and criminological work should strive to bridge these,
rather than privileging
one to the exclusion of the other.
Post-conflict reforms aimed at peace and security can also benefit from
localised, context-sensitive approaches, as illustrated in
National Ownership
Flaws and Promises: A Critical Analysis of DDR Program for Ex-Boko Haram
Combatants in Cameroon
Lydie Christelle Belporo
. This article
addresses a different facet of post-violence transition, the Disarmament,
Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) of
ex-combatants, in the context of
Cameroon’s struggle against the Boko Haram insurgency. DDR programmes are
common in the aftermath
of wars and are crucial for turning fighters back into
civilians and preventing cyclical violence. Belporo provides a critical
criminological
analysis of Cameroon’s DDR initiative for former Boko Haram
members, uncovering challenges in its design and implementation.
A key concern
identified is the issue of “national ownership”: while in principle
DDR should be led and tailored by the
affected nation (rather than imposed
externally), in practice Cameroon’s programme has faced difficulties truly
embedding in
local contexts.
Through qualitative research including interviews with ex-combatants and DDR
officials, the article finds that a top-down approach
and the lack of
involvement of “middle-range actors” (such as local community
leaders, traditional authorities, and grassroots
organisations) have hampered
the reintegration process. Ex-fighters often return to communities that are
fearful or resentful, and
without local intermediaries to facilitate
reconciliation and provide support, DDR centres risk becoming isolated camps
rather than
bridges back to society. Belporo proposes a conceptual framework of
dissociation and national appropriation, essentially calling
for DDR programmes
that dissociate from one-size-fits-all models and are creatively appropriated at
the national and local level.
This means empowering local actors in the Lake
Chad Basin region to adapt reintegration strategies to their cultural and
socio-economic
reality (for example, involving religious leaders in
deradicalisation, or designing livelihood training that fits local economies).
The findings emphasise an interdisciplinary understanding of DDR: not only a
security measure, but a social and psychological process
trust-building, community engagement, and attention to trauma. For criminology,
which often examines desistance and reintegration
of offenders, the Cameroon
case extends these concepts to the realm of political violence and terrorism. It
highlights that even
in dealing with extremist violence, a community-centred,
context-aware approach is key, aligning with the issue’s broader theme
that post-violence justice must move beyond rigid state-centred frameworks. The
article ultimately argues for more nuanced, context-sensitive
DDR policies that
recognise ex-combatants as a diverse group with varied motivations and
reintegration needs, and that harness local
resources to address the root causes
of radicalisation. This contributes to a criminological understanding of how
societies can break
cycles of violence through inclusive, locally grounded
strategies.
Gender and Transitional Justice
Gender justice emerges in this special issue as both a crucial domain of
transitional justice and a lens that challenges prevailing
practices. In
Hapless Victims to Collaborators: Exploring the Janus Voices of Women in the
Aguleri-Umueri Conflict in Igboland, Southeast Nigeria
Daniel Olisa
Iweze and Mary Nkechi Okadigwe
, we are confronted with a narrative that
defies the conventional portrayal of women in conflict solely as passive victims
or as natural
peacebuilders. The authors examine a protracted inter-communal
conflict between Aguleri and Umueri communities in Southeastern Nigeria,
uncovering the “Janus-faced” roles of women, Janus being the
two-faced Roman deity, which here symbolises the dual and
contradictory
positions women held during the conflict. Drawing from historical and
qualitative analyses, Iweze and Okadigwe detail
how women were indeed among the
most vulnerable and victimised by the violence (facing displacement, sexual
violence, loss of family
members), yet some women also took active parts in
fuelling the conflict, whether as instigators, spies, or logisticians for
factions. At the same time, other women were pivotal as peacemakers,
engaging through traditional institutions like the Umuada (a
daughters of the community) to negotiate ceasefires and mediate disputes. This
multifaceted involvement – which
places women as victims, perpetrators,
and peacebuilders – has often been underexplored in scholarly discourse,
which tends
to place women into a single category.
The article challenges criminologists and transitional justice practitioners
to abandon one-dimensional gender stereotypes. Understanding
that women can
simultaneously occupy positions of agency and victimhood complicates how we
assign responsibility and design post-conflict
interventions. For example,
demobilisation programmes and truth commissions must account for female
ex-combatants or collaborators
(who might otherwise be overlooked for
reintegration support or even accountability) just as they address female
survivors. The Nigeria
case also brings in a cultural context: Igbo
society’s gender complementarity meant women had their own avenues of
(like the Umuada) which could either dampen or escalate conflicts.
This suggests that effective peacebuilding must engage these indigenous
institutions. In broad terms, Iweze and Okadigwe’s contribution pushes
criminology to better integrate gender analysis,
recognising women’s
complex roles in violence beyond simplistic victim-perpetrator binaries. It
aligns with feminist criminological
insights that neither glorify nor ignore
women’s agency but rather seek to understand it in context.
Addressing gender in post-violence transitions inevitably involves
confronting sexual and gender-based violence, which has historically
marginalised as an “inevitable” by-product of war. Two articles in
the special issue tackle this difficult subject
head-on, proposing new
frameworks for justice for survivors of sexual violence. In
Restoring Sexual
Dignity: Sexual Violence, Human Dignity, and Transitional Justice in
Sandra Rios Oyola
, the focus is on Colombia’s armed
conflict and the women who suffered sexual and reproductive violence within it.
introduces the concept of “sexual dignity” to analyse how
transitional justice policies in Colombia have addressed (or
failed to address)
the harms of rape, forced pregnancy, and other gender-based crimes committed
during the conflict. Drawing on interviews
with stakeholders, from
victims’ organisations to officials in the Colombian Truth Commission and
the Special Jurisdiction
for Peace, as well as content analysis of reports and
legal documents, the article identifies a pattern of “dignity
and “dignity restoration.”
In essence, the perpetration of sexual violence is seen as a deliberate
stripping away of a victim’s dignity and agency, not
just a physical
violation. Accordingly, justice efforts must aim at restoring that dignity in
multiple dimensions. Rios Oyola proposes
four key binary dimensions where loss
must be countered with restoration: body violation versus body autonomy; lack of
control over
the future versus control over one’s future; denial of the
past versus authorship of one’s narrative, and shame versus
honour. This
framework is a powerful tool for policymakers, as it suggests that reparations
and programmes for survivors should not
only provide material or medical aid but
also address these existential and social injuries. For instance, ensuring a
survivor can
reclaim control over her future might involve educational
opportunities or supporting her in having children by choice, countering
sense of powerlessness imposed by rape. Enabling survivors to tell their stories
and thus take on an authorial role in official
histories or memorials can
counteract the silencing once endured. Importantly, the article also touches on
non-material forms of
healing, like spiritual ceremonies and community rituals,
as part of dignity restoration, acknowledging that for many survivors justice
as much about emotional and spiritual repair as it is about courts and
In the context of Colombia’s transitional justice process, Rios
Oyola’s insights bring to light both progress and gaps:
while sexual
violence was eventually included in the agenda of truth-telling and reparations
(thanks largely to feminist advocacy),
there remains a risk that these crimes
are sidelined, or their redress is superficial. This contributes a new dimension
within criminology
as the article illustrates a human-rights-centred approach to
violence that moves beyond seeing sexual assault in war as merely a
crime to be
prosecuted. Instead, it sees it as a profound violation of personhood requiring
a transformative justice approach, one
that aims to change societal attitudes
(removing stigma from victims, placing it on perpetrators) and to empower
survivors in rebuilding
their lives.

Justice for the Invisible, Unspeakable and
Inevitable: An Abolition Feminism Analysis of Sexual Violence and the
International Criminal
Natalie Hēni Maihi
sweeping critique of how global justice mechanisms deal with conflict-related
sexual violence. Maihi begins by acknowledging
the increased visibility of
sexual and gender-based violence in the 1990s (after atrocities in Rwanda and
the former Yugoslavia shocked
the world). This visibility, paradoxically, often
reduced victims to a faceless mass of the “victimised” and cast
perpetrators
as monsters, narratives that can strip away the individual agency
of victims and the complex motives of offenders, replacing them
stereotypes. The establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002
was supposed to be a triumph for ending impunity
for such crimes, yet as Maihi
notes, the ICC has managed only two convictions for SGBV in its two decades of
By examining court transcripts and records from two landmark ICC cases,
Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba
(which involved rape committed by
Congolese rebels in Central African Republic) and
Prosecutor v. Dominic
(which included charges of sexual slavery and forced marriage by a
Ugandan LRA commander), the article exposes the limitations of
approach. Maihi applies an abolition feminism lens, a perspective that is
sceptical of carceral and punitive solutions
and instead advocates for
transformative justice focused on survivor healing and perpetrator
accountability outside traditional prisons.
The analysis reveals that despite
the ICC’s intentions, its proceedings often subject survivors to
retraumatization (through
invasive questioning and the slow pace of trials) and
fail to address the broader contexts that enabled sexual violence. Moreover,
ICC’s focus on individual perpetrators can ignore the systemic, often
racialised narratives, for instance, depicting African
perpetrators as
embodiments of evil, that absolve structural forces (like militarism or
patriarchy) from blame.
Maihi’s abolition feminist critique points out the violence innate to
the ICC’s own operations: a court that promises
justice but delivers it
sparingly, and in doing so may inadvertently perpetuate the idea that legal
punishment is the only form of
justice. The article suggests transformative
justice as a meaningful alternative, one where the emphasis is on meeting
needs, involving communities in reconciliation, and preventing
future violence by transforming social conditions, rather than simply
incarcerating a few leaders. For criminology, especially critical criminology,
Maihi’s work is a call to re-imagine justice
for sexual violence in
conflict. It challenges us to question whether international trials, as they are
currently conducted, truly
serve survivors or deter crimes, and to consider
complementary or alternative models that prioritise healing, restorative
and the dismantling of harmful power structures. By bringing
abolitionist thought (often applied to domestic criminal justice) into
of transitional justice, the article bridges fields and asks difficult questions
Is it to punish the guilty, to
restore the dignity of victims, or to reshape society to prevent such
atrocities? Ideally, it should
be all three; achieving this requires innovative
thinking and the courage to critique established institutions, as this article
exemplifies.
Conclusion: Towards a Criminology of Transition and Transformation
Altogether, the 11 articles of this special issue advance a coherent
argument: criminology has a vital role to play in understanding
and facilitating
post-violence transitions, in partnership with human rights, memory studies, and
transitional justice scholarship.
The contributions demonstrate that moving a
society from a past marked by violence towards a future grounded in justice and
is a multifaceted process, one that involves not only courts and truth
commissions, but also social movements, cultural interventions,
and grassroots
innovations. In engaging with contexts from the Global South and beyond, the
special issue also emphasises the importance
of epistemological diversity: we
have seen Western legal norms conversing with Indigenous traditions in Colombia,
South African spiritual
concepts illuminating forensic science, feminist
frameworks challenging international tribunals, and local activists in various
transforming or supplementing state-led initiatives.
A key reflection emerging from this collection is the concept of
“criminology in transition.” Just as societies undergo
transitions,
criminology itself is transitioning, expanding its scope beyond conventional
crime and punishment to address questions
of mass violence, historical
injustice, and human rights. This expansion requires criminologists to be in
dialogue with other disciplines
and with practitioners on the ground. It also
requires comfort with critically interrogating a given state, since in many
transitional
scenarios the state (or its agents) has been the primary
perpetrator of violence. The special issue presents criminology as engaging
state crime, as seen in analyses of dictatorships and civil war atrocities and
also exploring how communities respond to such
crime when formal justice is
inadequate.
Another insight is the significance of memory and narrative in post-violence
contexts. Several authors highlighted that how society
remembers violence -
whose stories are told, whose are silenced, and what lessons are drawn - can
either bolster or undermine justice.
Memory can empower survivors (as in
Guatemala and Chile) or be manipulated by those who would return to repression
(as cautioned
by the Argentina case). For future research, criminologists could
deepen engagement with memory studies, for instance by studying
the impact of
memorials, museums, or education reforms on violence prevention and community
resilience.
The issue also underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary methods and
participatory approaches. Ethnography and interviews gave
voice to victims and
activists (Ndow, Masek, Iweze & Okadigwe), legal analysis unpacked
institutions (Olarte Delgado, Figari
Layus, Maihi), and theoretical syntheses
offered new concepts like temporal imaginations and sexual dignity (Masek, Rios
Going forward, scholars should continue to blend methods, perhaps
combining quantitative data on conflict with qualitative testimony,
historical archival work with contemporary observation, to build a richer
picture of transitions. Importantly, researchers should
strive to involve local
communities in the knowledge production process, mirroring the participatory
spirit that many articles herein
advocate in practice. Collaborative research
with survivors, ex-combatants, and grassroots groups can yield insights that
more extractive
research might miss, and it embodies the very ethos of
empowerment that transitional justice champions.
Looking to the future, we identify six directions for further inquiry and
practice that build on the findings of this special issue.
The first direction
for further inquiry and practice would address
safeguarding transitional
justice gains
. As shown in Argentina’s current predicament,
backsliding is a real threat. Researchers and practitioners should investigate
strategies to protect truth and justice measures from political reversal, for
example, the legal entrenchment of human rights policies,
or international
support networks that can bolster domestic activism when local space closes. The
second direction for further inquiry
and practice would consider
integrating
local and indigenous justice mechanisms into Western-centric approaches
importance of legal pluralism is a topic which features heavily in this special
issue. Future work could explore models for
hybrid courts or community tribunals
that operate alongside national systems, ensuring that Indigenous concepts (like
reconciliation
ceremonies or communal reparations) stand on equal footing with
formal legal approaches. Comparative studies between different countries
yield best practices for genuine intercultural justice.
The third direction for further inquiry and practice is related to
transformative gender justice
. Despite progress, gender-based harms often
remain inadequately addressed. A forward agenda includes transformative justice
for sexual violence survivors, greater inclusion of women (and LGBTQ+
individuals) in peace negotiations and post-conflict planning,
and continued
feminist critique of institutions to make them more survivor-centric.
Criminology can contribute by evaluating the
efficacy of such programmes and
highlighting gendered experiences of justice. The fourth direction for further
inquiry and practice
expanding the notion of accountability
Traditional prosecutions target individual perpetrators, but many authors in
this issue ask an implicit question: how do we hold
systems accountable? Future
research might look at mechanisms like truth commission follow-up units, vetting
of abusive officials,
or reparative initiatives aimed at institutions (police,
military, corporations) that enabled violence. This has the potential to
accountability from individuals to structures, a space where criminology’s
understanding of organisational crime and
corruption can be very
influential.
The fifth direction for further inquiry and practice deals with
and psychosocial support as justice
. Several studies included in this
special issue touched on trauma and healing. There is room for criminologists to
collaborate with
psychologists and public health experts to measure the impact
of justice interventions on community healing. For instance, do truth-telling
processes reduce trauma symptoms? Does involvement in activism improve
survivors’ well-being? By treating healing as a core
component of justice,
not an incidental by-product, transitional processes can be designed to be more
trauma-informed and supportive.
The final direction for further inquiry and
practice that we have identified is
linking more strictly the nexus between
environmental and transitional justice
. Masek’s article on Guatemala
hints at a burgeoning area: the intersection of environmental harm and past
political violence.
In many conflict-affected regions, disputes over land and
resources are both causes and consequences of violence. Future research
examine how transitional justice could incorporate environmental justice, for
example, restoring lands to Indigenous communities
as a form of reparation, or
addressing climate change as part of guarantees of non-recurrence in war-torn
This special issue illustrates a criminology that is engaged, critical, and
hopeful. The challenges of post-violence transitions are
immense: impunity,
trauma, distrust, and inequality do not disappear overnight. Yet, articles in
this special issue also document
remarkable resilience and innovation: mothers
banding together to seek the disappeared; communities digging up the truth with
own hands; social movements reinventing collective identity, and scholars
proposing new lenses to understand dignity and harm. Our
conceptual reflections
have led us to view transitional contexts not just as sites of tumult and
fragility, but as laboratories of
social change where new forms of justice can
emerge. The epistemological field of criminology, especially in its critical and
interdisciplinary
incarnations, is well-positioned to learn from and contribute
to these processes.
We reiterate that the intersection of criminology with human rights,
grassroots activism, transitional justice, and memory is a fertile
ground that
demands continued exploration. By embracing complexity, the intersectional
truths of survivors, the interplay of formal
and informal justice, and the
coexistence of hope and backlash, criminologists and practitioners can better
support societies aiming
to break cycles of violence. We hope this special issue
serves as a step in that direction, encouraging further scholarship that
only analyses post-violence transitions but actively engages with them, in
pursuit of a more just and peaceful world.
