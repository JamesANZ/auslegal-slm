The applicant is unrepresented
This is an ex parte application for leave to issue or file an application for a
constitutional or other writ against the
Attorney‑General for Western
Australia. The relief that the applicant seeks in the proposed application for
a constitutional
or other writ is, relevantly, "[t]hat the [Court] quash
for jurisdictional error ... a) Decision and orders of Master Russell dated
31 January 2025 in CIV 2150 of 2023; b) Decision and orders of the Court of
Appeal (Jackson v NAB
[2025] WASCA 80)
dated 23 May 2025" ("the decisions

the application for a constitutional or other writ against
the Attorney‑General for Western Australia, nor any of the
applicant's supporting affidavits, discloses any rational legal argument that
could support the relief sought. The claims set out
in the proposed application
against the Attorney‑General for Western Australia are manifestly
hopeless. Moreover, to the extent
the proposed application for a
constitutional or other writ seeks to quash the decisions and orders, it is
inappropriate for the
original jurisdiction of this Court to be invoked as
an alternative to remedying allegedly erroneous judgments by way of an
