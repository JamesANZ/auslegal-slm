THE YOUTH JUSTICE COURT
AT DARWIN IN THE NORTHERN
TERRITORY OF
Claim No. 22208515
REASONS FOR DECISION
(Delivered 3 October 2022)
Judge Macdonald
is a decision in relation to 4 charges brought against RS on 18 March 2022,
following an unlawful entry by a number of youths
at premises in Driver Avenue
(the premises), Palmerston, on 14 March 2022. The charges alleged are; trespass,
damage property, unlawful
entry of a dwelling house and stealing, contrary to
Trespass Act 1987
(NT), and sections 241(1), 213(1) and
(4) and 210 of the
Criminal Code
(NT), respectively.
28 September 2022 RS pleaded not guilty to each of the four charges and a
contested hearing ensued.
to the nature, depth and importance of her relationship with RS, his mother was
excused from giving oral evidence under
Evidence (National
Uniform Legislation) Act 2011
(NT) (ENULA). The owner of the premises then
gave evidence, followed by investigating member Senior Constable Clifford
from the premises recorded on 14 March 2022, together with photographs of a
Chicago Bulls cap, a tricolour T-shirt and a pair
of red and black puma runners,
jewellery and a bundle of Indonesian rupiah seized by police at RS’s
residence on 15 March 2022,
were also tendered into evidence. Due to

understood RS was cautioned in
the presence of his mother prior to the attending members conducting any
investigation at his residence
(which investigation was, I understand, with the
clear consent of his mother and, in due course, with RS’s cooperation and
assistance), it appeared that a requirement prescribed by

is quite conceivable that some other youth known to RS was wearing the clothes
seized, then left them in RS’s bedroom. Knowledge
of the existence and
location of the jewellery and rupiah would be equally explicable given the real
possibility that RS could have
been given that contraband by some other
relevant youth at the premises had, for most of the footage, covered the
majority of his face with black fabric, appearing to
be a T-shirt. Nonetheless,
the apparent height, slim physique, and shoulder-length brown hair of the youth
bears a very definite
resemblance to RS. Of most significance is that, over the
period 2 minutes 10 seconds to 2 minutes 23 seconds on the third item of
footage comprising exhibit P2, the youth’s face covering falls almost
entirely away, such that only the youth’s
chin and bottom lip are
obscured. In addition, the youth looks in the direction of, albeit not directly
at, the camera, enabling

Although from a distance of
more than 5 metres, that footage depicts a narrow, well-defined and noble face,
with distinctive eyes,
bearing a striking similarity to RS. Although reasonable
minds may differ, it is possible some reasonable doubt might subsist on
basis of that portion of the CCTV alone.
Regardless,
the combination of the physical evidence seized at RS’s home together with
the CCTV referred to leaves no reasonable
doubt that RS is the youth depicted on
the CCTV from the premises. I note that a significant and material difference
exists between
