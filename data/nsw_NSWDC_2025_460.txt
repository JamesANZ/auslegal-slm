Plaintiff proceeds by Statement of Claim for an unpaid portion of an amount owed
under a Payment Claim served on the Defendant

Payment Claim 31
”), the unpaid portion being $200,485.12
(inclusive of GST). The Plaintiff makes its claim pursuant to
s 15(2)(a)(i)
Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999
”). There is no dispute that sum remains unpaid.
Without more, the Plaintiff would ordinarily be entitled to sue for the debt

of the Act.
is agreed that Payment Claim 31 was a valid Payment Claim in accordance with
of the Act and clause 37.1 of the Contract. It is agreed that the Defendant
did not serve a Payment Schedule in response to Payment
Claim 31 within 10 days:
of the Act.
Amended Defence (leave was granted on the second day of hearing for the
Defendant to amend its defence), the Defendant denies that
the Plaintiff is
entitled to proceed on the basis of Payment Claim 31. The Defendant says that
communications by email between the
parties over the two days of 12 and 13
December 2024 and, in particular, the Tax Invoices then conveyed, evidenced an
implied agreement
between the parties that Payment Claim 31 was withdrawn.
Defendant does not positively contend that, and makes no admission as to
whether, the Plaintiff's Tax Invoices issued on 12 and
13 December 2024 (or
either of them) were valid Payment Claims made under the Act: Exhibit A; further
and better particulars of the
original Defence; particulars of the Amended
understand that the parties agree that the issue for determination is whether
their dealings on 12 and 13 December 2024 infer that
an implied agreement was
struck between them that Payment Claim 31 was withdrawn. The Defendant argues
that this is the case. Conversely,
the Plaintiff argues that the 12 and 13
December 2024 dealings reflect mere commercial accommodations to the Defendant
for a small
reduction of the amount owed under Payment Claim 31. The Plaintiff
argues that the Defendant was required to pay the amount owed
under Payment
Claim 31 within 15 business days of it being served or it would breach its
obligations under the Contract (clause 37.2)
and the statutory regime
of the Act).
is not contested that, but for the Defendant being successful in its argument
that the parties agreed over 12 to 13 December 2024
that the Payment Claim
served 22 November 2024 was withdrawn, the Defendant became liable to pay the
claimed amount to the Plaintiff
from 15 business days after the service of
Payment Claim 31 on 22 November 2024, that date being 13 December 2024:

closing submissions, the Defendant clarified that it relied only on principles
of contract law and did not advance any defence
of estoppel.
payments were made by the Defendant to the Plaintiff after the dispute arose
over Payment Claim 31, leaving the balance at $200,485.12,

either argument because performing the payments after the dispute is an action
equally consistent with Payment Claim
31 having been withdrawn, as the Defendant
submits, as it is with the Tax Invoice being a mere accommodation, as the
Plaintiff submits.
dispute arises between substantial and sophisticated builders. The parties
entered a construction contract on 22 March 2022 (“
”) for the construction of a development at 3 Wiston Gardens,
Double Bay, Sydney at a "Target Trade Cost" of $16,102,599 (excluding
Contract Item 15. Pursuant to the Contract, the Plaintiff was to carry out
design and construction of the development.
15 August 2024, the parties varied the Contract by Deed (“
”). The parties did not make any submission of fact or law arising
out of the terms of the Deed, by which they effectively terminated
the Contract
and entered into mutual releases from prior accrued liabilities. The subject
claim falls within “Excluded Claims”
according to the Deed.
relation to Payment Claim 29, issued 30 September 2024, the parties exchanged
emails regarding information within the claim prior
to the Defendant serving a
Payment Schedule on the 10th business day following service. The
Defendant’s covering email stated
that the only difference between the
Payment Claim and the Payment Schedule was the Defendant’s rejection of
$17,121 in relation
to a Shotcrete item. On 18 October 2024, at the behest of
the Defendant, the Plaintiff forwarded a Tax Invoice in the sum of the
Schedule, being the sum of Payment Claim 29 less the sum of the disputed
shotcrete item.
relation to Payment Claim 30 issued on 31 October 2024, the parties exchanged
emails between 13 and 14 November 2024 that commented
on inclusions within the
Payment Claim and, on the 10th business day following service, the Defendant
served its Payment Schedule
noting that the only change was a reduction of
$58,424 for construction insurance. The next day, being 15 November 2024, the
issued its Tax Invoice to the Defendant in the sum of Payment Claim 30
less the sum of the insurance item.
regard to both Payment Claims 29 and 30, the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoices bore
the identical statement, “This is a payment
claim made under the...
Act” which appears at the conclusion of the Plaintiff’s Tax Invoice
forwarded to the Defendant
on 13 December 2024, which invoice is at the centre
of the contest.
Claim 31 claimed the sum of $521,207.41 (excluding GST), comprised of the value
of works carried out by the Plaintiff in March
2024 in the sum of $339,515.77
(excluding GST) and retention monies due to be released by the Defendant to the
Plaintiff, pursuant
to clause 4.4 of the Deed, in the sum of $181,691.64
(excluding GST).
Payment Claim 31 was withdrawn, the time for the Defendant to issue a Payment
Schedule in response to it had lapsed on 6 December
2024: Contract clause 37.2;
of the Act. The period for payment by the Defendant to the Plaintiff of
Payment Claim 31 expired on 13 December 2024: Contract clause
s 11(1A)(a)
of the Act.
The 12 – 13 December 2024 Conduct
12 December, the penultimate day for payment of the Payment Claim 31, the
Defendant emailed the Plaintiff at 9:45 AM claiming that
there were “some
small claims” for glazed windows, fly screens, glazed balustrades, render
and carpentry which the Defendant
“assumed... are errors”:
“Contractors Tax Invoice-Can you please kindly remove the above mentioned
minor amount
and issue the Tax invoice dated 30th November $338,948.21 plus
GST”. The email was headed “Subject: Re: Progress Claim
November 2024...” The email referred the Plaintiff to comments of the
Defendant’s quantity surveyor. The assertion
of “errors” and
the email subject recital make connection to Payment Claim 31.
compliance with the Defendant’s request, the Plaintiff issued a Tax
Invoice on the same 12 December 2024 at 2:38 PM for an
amount only reduced by
$567.56 from the value of the work performed, claimed in Payment Claim 31. The
email simply stated, “Please
find attached invoice as requested”.
The Plaintiff dated the invoice 9 December 2024. The “Due Date” was
as 20 December 2024.
13 December 2024, at 9:04 AM, the Defendant emailed the Plaintiff making the
request: “can you lease (sic) chance (sic) the
invoice date to November
please” [the parties agree the email should be read:
please change the invoice date to November please”]. Thirteen minutes
later, at 9:17 AM, the Plaintiff emailed
the Defendant a fresh Tax Invoice in
the same adjusted sum and giving the same due date for payment of 20 December
2024, but with
the covering email stating: “Invoice date changed to the
date we issued the claim”. The attached Tax Invoice was dated
22 November
2024, being the date of Payment Claim 31. The email was headed, “Subject:

CONSIDERATION
Defendant submits that a contractual agreement to withdraw Payment Claim 31 is
to be inferred from the emails on 12 and 13 December
do not understand it to be disputed that Payment Claims can be withdrawn.
Defendant argues that the contractual agreement arises not from a formal offer
and acceptance but, rather, argues that the Court
would “infer... [a
contractual agreement from] a real intention express[ed] through, or to be found
in, a body of conduct,
including... communications...”:

v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd
(2001) 117 FCR 424 at [369].
bear in mind that the subjective understanding or intention of the parties as
they corresponded over 12-13 December 2024 is not
important. The construction of
the documents is to be determined by answering the question: what would a
reasonable bystander in
the position of the parties have understood them to
mean. This requires consideration not only of the documents on their face, but
also of the surrounding circumstances of which the parties were aware of and the
purpose and objective of their commercial engagement:
Pacific Carriers Ltd v
BNP Paribas
[2004] HCA 35
(2004) 208 ALR 213.
Defendant sought to highlight one of those surrounding circumstances as the
legislative backdrop of
of the Act which provides that a complainant may
only serve one Payment Claim in any particular month for construction work
out or undertaken to be carried out in that month.
Defendant does not positively contend that, nor makes any admission as to
whether, either of the two Tax Invoices issued over
the 12-13 December 2024
correspondence were valid Payment Claims for the purposes of the Act.
no more assists the Defendant than the Plaintiff in determining
the central question of whether an agreement to withdraw Payment
Claim 31 was
reached because of the 12-13 December 2024 correspondence. Neither party submits
that the re-issued invoices provided
on 12 and 13 December 2024 were actually
valid Payment Claims, and I find no good reason to find otherwise; accordingly,
no necessary withdrawal of the prior Payment Claim due to the operation

”) at [4] (per Hammerschlag J).
argument submitted by the Defendant is that the reasonable objective
bystander, knowing the legislative backdrop of
, and that a revised
Payment Claim would necessarily withdraw Payment Claim 31, would conclude that
the parties evinced an intention
to issue a new Payment Claim for the same works
and so, even if that attempt were unsuccessful, it must have been their
to withdraw the 22 November 2024 Payment Claim 31.
question remains whether the parties by their conduct on 12 and 13 December 2024
objectively evinced an intention for the withdrawal
of Payment Claim 31.
Defendant submitted that the principles espoused by Hammerschlag J in
Refractories v Consultant Bricklaying
support its argument. The Defendant
drew attention to his Honour’s observations at [39] that:
“The Plaintiff’s statement that it would pay a different rate was an
offer to the defendant, which it accepted by issue
of the second invoice.”
relevant facts in
NC Refractories v Consultant Bricklaying
After receiving
the first defendant’s payment claim, the Plaintiff sent the following
I am very disappointed with the out come (sic) of this project.
This as significant monetary burden on us and effect (sic) our reputation as
supplier and installer.
Regardless of above, the guys have to paid (sic). I expect you to provide me
actual costs incurred by you + 10% (not @$70 per hour).
I do not intend to drag on the issue but you have to be realist (sic) under the
We will pay @$50 for Ord Hour, @$60 for OTI.5 and @70 for OT2.
Await your response.”
defendant responded to the plaintiff the next day with the following
“Attached revised invoice reflecting reduction in rates. Would ask that
this be settled as a matter of urgency.” (underlining
added for emphasis)
those communications show, the plaintiff in that case made plain that it had no
intention of paying the Payment Claim enumerated
by the first defendant’s
invoice. The plaintiff clearly stated that it was not going to pay at the rate
of 70$ per hour (for,
presumedly, ordinary hours worked). The rejection of the
calculation for the invoice was followed by an offer made by the plaintiff,
“We will pay @$50 for Ord Hour, @$60 for OTI.5 and @70 for OT2.” In
response, the first defendant provided an invoice
which was referred to as a
“revised” invoice. The word revised strongly inferred that the first
defendant had accepted
the plaintiff’s offer of an hourly rates basis for
calculation of payment due.
facts in the instant case distinguish it from
NC Refractories v Consultant
Bricklaying
. The correspondence in evidence in this case bears the hallmarks
of a commercial party engaging in an administrative method of commercial
goodwill or compromise in a minor sum to facilitate payment, as the Plaintiff
properly submits at [34(l)].
arguing that a shared intention for withdrawal was evinced, the Defendant
firstly relied on the email from Ryan Khatri (for the
Defendant) on 12 December
2024, at 9:45 AM, asking for the Contractor's Tax Invoice to have minor amounts
removed and the Tax Invoice
to be issued for $338,948.21 plus GST and dated 30
November 2025. Neither party was able to explain why the request was for the
to be dated “30 November 2024” as opposed to 22 November
2024 (the date of issue of Payment Claim 31). Counsel for the
Plaintiff rightly
pointed out that the Plaintiff never provided an invoice dated 30 November 2024,
only an invoice dated 22 November
2024: T 16.38-40. As I already observed, the
email referred to Payment Claim 31 in its subject line. I find as a matter of
and common-sense that the reference to “30 November” in the 12
December 2024 email at 9:45 AM was a typographical error
or a lax reference to
the “November” Payment Claim, being Payment Claim 31. I note that
Payment Claims were issued monthly.
my opinion, the request by the Defendant for the re-issued Tax Invoice to bear
the same date as Payment Claim 31 leads to a reasonable
assumption that the
parties displayed an intention that Payment Claim 31 be still operative and not
be withdrawn. This is particularly
so since there was no explicit request by the
Defendant for Payment Claim 31 to be withdrawn, or to vary the statutory
requirement
of payment within 15 days:
of the Act. I find these facts
compelling. I also think it significant that the amount of the adjustment which
the Defendant requested
in the invoice, and to which the Plaintiff agreed to,
was very minor.
Defendant, unlike how it had previously practised in relation to Payment Claims
29 and 30, did not serve a Payment Schedule.
I reject the Defendant’s
submission (at [29(d)]) in respect of the Affidavit evidence of Mr Scarf that
his observations of
the parties’ dealings with Payment Claims 29 and 30 is
equally consistent with “the alternative inference that there
general practice under which the Plaintiff reissued and varied its earlier
payment claim following dealings.” The submission
does not meet with the
facts set out at [11]-[13] above.
Plaintiff submitted, and I agree, that the due date for payment provided by the
13 December 2024 Tax Invoice at 9:17 AM is best
characterised as showing an
agreed intention held by the parties for there to be a 5-business-day extension
from the due date for
payment of 13 December 2024, that date being the original
due date for payment owed as a result of the service of Payment Claim 31
November 2024.
to standard notations on the Tax Invoices issued on 12 and 13 December 2024, the
Defendant put in oral submissions that:
“It can’t be in contest that the basis for the resolution in
relation to the proper construction of the parties’
dealings in respect of
this issue is the objective theory of contract. What would a reasonable person
have inferred, observing this
exchange of correspondence between the partes?
And, of profound significance to the defendant’s case is that the
has explicitly, in bold, very prominently, asserted that this
constituted a payment claim under the Act.” (T 15.35).
both Tax Invoices bore the bolded notification that the invoice was a
“payment claim made under the
Building and Construction Industry Security
of Payment Act 1999
”, I do not think that this would lead an objective
bystander to presume that the parties intended for those tax invoices to
Payment Claims that necessarily withdrew Payment Claim 31. On the whole of the
evidence and, most importantly, the face of
the Tax Invoices, I think a
reasonable bystander, being aware of the prior mode of dealing of the parties as
experienced industry
participants, would see the familiar statutorily required
notifications as no more than confirmation that they are tax invoices related
Payment Claim 31.
Ultimately,
it is my opinion that the 12-13 December 2024 correspondence is more consistent
with the Tax Invoices conveying no more
than a commercial compromise for slight
adjustment of value and extension of time to pay. That is to say, an agreement
was reached
that the Plaintiff would not proceed on the basis of its
statutory rights for debt as long as $338,948.21 plus GST was paid by 20
December 2025. I do not find, on the balance of probabilities,
that a reasonable
person observing the conduct of the parties would infer that there was a
bilateral or even unilateral (from the
Plaintiff’s behest) intention for
the Plaintiff to have disabled (even temporarily) its rights under Payment Claim
determined the submissions going to there having been an implied contract
between the parties I have, in essence, dealt with
the Defendant’s
submission that the Plaintiff would be inviting an abuse of process by enforcing
a statutory debt arising from
Payment Claim 31. I reject that submission by the
for the Plaintiff in the sum of $200,485.12 (including GST).
