REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Applicant, Mr David John Reed, seeks review of the decision of the Queensland
Building and Construction Commission (‘QBCC’)
dated 15 July 2022
refusing his application for a Builder – Restricted to Structural
Landscaping Licence (‘BRSL Licence’).
[2] The sole
issue in dispute is whether the Applicant has demonstrated four years'
experience in the scope of work for the BRSL Licence
class as required by the
Queensland Building and Construction Commission Regulation 2018
(Qld) (‘the Regulation’).
Applicant's technical qualifications are not in issue, nor are the financial
requirements. The QBCC accepts that the Applicant's
qualifications exceed the
qualification requirements for the
Legislative Framework
objects of the
Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act 1991
(Qld) (the ‘QBCC Act’) are set out in section 3, which relevantly
The objects of this Act are—
(a) to regulate the building industry—
(i) to ensure the maintenance of proper standards in the industry;
[5] Section
31(1)(b) of the QBCC Act provides that a person is entitled to a contractor's
licence if the QBCC is satisfied that:
the applicant has the qualifications and experience required by regulation in
relation to a licence of the relevant class
[6] Section
34(1) provides that if the QBCC is satisfied that an applicant is entitled to a
licence, it must issue a licence of the
appropriate class.
[7] Section 35
of the QBCC Act deals with the imposition of conditions on licences and is
relevant to the interpretation of experience
requirements. Section 35(2)
provides that the QBCC may only grant a licence subject to a restrictive
condition (restricting the scope
of work) if the licence is a new class and the
QBCC is satisfied the applicant does not have adequate experience in all of the
of work for the licence. This provision suggests that, ordinarily, an
applicant must have adequate experience across the scope of
[8] Schedule 2,
Part 10 of the Regulation sets out the requirements for a BRSL Licence:
Builder restricted to structural landscaping.
(1) Prepare, fabricate and erect carports, decking, fences, gates, gazebos,
ornamental structures, pergolas, ponds and water features,
prefabricated sheds
(including associated concrete slabs with a floor area of not more than
10m²), and retaining walls and structures.
(2) Construct artificial landform structures requiring a fabricated internal
(3) Prepare site, excavate, lay paving or concrete associated
with landscaping.
(4) Install irrigation for landscaping works.
(5) Install, erect and construct playground equipment.
(6) Prepare plans and specifications that are—
(a) for the licensee’s personal use; or
(b) for use in building work to be performed by the licensee personally.
(7) Construct, maintain and repair a tennis court or another sporting court,
including, for example, the following—
(a) prepare or excavate the site;
(b) concrete for the construction, maintenance or repair of the court;
(c) apply materials or treatments to the surface of the court.
requirements
(b) otherwise—4 years experience in—
(i) the scope of work for the class; or
(ii) other work the commission is satisfied is at least equivalent to experience
in the scope of work for the class.
Statutory Construction
central issue is the proper construction of the phrase "4 years experience in
the scope of work for the class" in Schedule
2, Part 10, section 5(b)(i) of the
Regulation.
Applicant submits that this does not require demonstrated experience in each and
every item within the scope of work. The
QBCC submits that, viewed practically,
an applicant must demonstrate experience across the entirety of the scope of
subordinate legislation, the Regulation must be construed in accordance with
ordinary principles of statutory construction.
The task requires consideration
of the text, context, and purpose:
Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian

the nature of works and advising potential applicants of criteria

licence. It is addressed to practical people skilled in particular trades and

Relevant Tribunal Decisions
Saunders v QBCC
Gardiner stated:
The granting of a builder's licence allows the builder freedom to build
unsupervised. The objects of the QBCC Act include ensuring
the maintenance of
proper standards in the industry. It follows that the standard of experience and
the breadth of experience required
to licence a builder who seeks to be
responsible to the Queensland community should be higher than the learning phase
of a builder's
[16] To similar
Phillips v QBCC
’), Member Holzberger stated:
... The maintenance of proper standards requires in my view more than merely
demonstrating employment as a tradesman or labourer
on building sites for the
requisite period. Rather it requires an applicant to demonstrate that he has
over that period carried out
under supervision of a licensed person the types of
tasks and responsibilities that he will be permitted to undertake without such
supervision should his licence be granted.
’) Member Olding addressed the experience requirement
for a Building Design licence:
... I take the view that the Tribunal must ask whether, viewed practically, the
experience as a whole would be properly characterised
as at least two years of
experience across the entirety of the specified scope of work.
The Proper Construction of the Experience Requirement
accept the Applicant's submission that Schedule 2, Part 10 does not expressly
state that an applicant must demonstrate experience
in each and every item of
the scope of work. If the legislature had intended to impose such a requirement,
it could have done so
explicitly.
[19] However, I
also accept that the task is not merely to count years of employment in the
building industry. The question is whether
the Applicant has demonstrated
experience that, viewed practically and as a whole, properly constitutes four
years' experience in
the scope of work for the BRSL Licence class.
construction is consistent with:
(a) The objects of the QBCC Act, particularly ensuring maintenance of proper
(b) The practical approach required by
(c) Section 35(2) of the QBCC Act, which contemplates that ordinarily an
applicant should have adequate experience across the scope
(d) The provision in section 5(b)(ii) for "equivalent" experience, suggesting
some flexibility.
experience requirement must be assessed having regard to the fact that, once
licensed, the holder may undertake any work
within the scope without
supervision. The Tribunal must be satisfied that the Applicant has sufficient
breadth and depth of experience
to competently and safely undertake the range of
work encompassed by the licence.
[22] Significantly,
Mr Klemm's own evidence supports a flexible approach. When asked whether failure
to build a pergola would disqualify
an applicant, he stated that if the
applicant had the knowledge to supervise other trades in building that pergola,
it would not
preclude them from holding the

Playground Equipment
is uncontroversial that the Applicant has extensive and superior experience in
installing, erecting, and constructing playground
equipment. Mr Klemm accepted
this. This represents a significant component of the scope of work.
Site Preparation, Excavation, and Concrete Work
Klemm accepted that the Applicant has demonstrated experience in preparing
sites, excavating, and laying concrete associated
with landscaping work. The
evidence supports this finding.
Retaining Walls and Structures
Applicant relies on three retaining wall projects to demonstrate experience in
this aspect:
Parkinson Avenue (2003).
This was a keystone block retaining wall
approximately 22 metres long and 1.2 metres high, constructed at the Applicant's
own property.
The work was undertaken with the assistance of Simon Barker and
David Grzegorczyk. While the Applicant could not produce the council
his evidence that approval was required and obtained was not challenged and I
accept it. The Applicant stated he believed
it was built to the relevant
Australian Standard, and he was not challenged on this point.
[28] The absence
of documentary evidence is concerning, particularly given the work was
undertaken 22 years ago. However, there is
supporting affidavit evidence from Mr
Gantis and Mr Purdy who observed the construction. Mr Baker provided technical
oversight and
was present when the works were carried out. While this was unpaid
work at the Applicant's own property, it, nonetheless, constitutes
experience in constructing a substantial retaining wall.
[29] Jindalee
State School (2018–2019).
I reject the QBCC's submission that the
sandstone blocks at Jindalee were merely "garden edging." The photographic
evidence clearly
shows sandstone blocks forming a wall line retaining earth
behind it. The Applicant gave detailed evidence about site preparation,
concreting/asphalting to create a stable surface, and calculations to assess
whether the sandstone was suitable for the forces from
the grade and material
[30] Mr Klemm's
position that this was not a retaining wall because it does not conform to the
by AS4678 (which covers structures up to
15 metres in height) is unpersuasive. Retaining walls come in various scales,
and this work
demonstrates practical experience in constructing a retaining
structure appropriate to the forces involved.
Saltwater Avenue (2007).
This was a two-tier timber sleeper retaining wall
constructed at the Applicant's investment property with assistance from Mr
The Applicant's evidence was that no building approval was required as
it was under the relevant height requirement. While documentary
evidence is
limited, the photographic evidence and the Applicant's uncontested evidence
[32] Across
these three projects, spanning different construction methods (keystone blocks,
sandstone blocks, and timber sleepers),
I am satisfied the Applicant has
demonstrated adequate experience in constructing retaining walls and structures
for the purposes
of the BRSL Licence scope.
Applicant relies on one carport project at Dunbogan, NSW, where he assisted Mr
Barker with an insurance rebuild. The Applicant's
evidence was that he rebuilt
the carport structurally (excluding steel posts), including new rafters, beams,
and roof sheeting.
[34] Mr Klemm's
concerns centered on the lack of documentary evidence and his view that this was
only a repair to an existing carport
attached to a house, rather than
construction of a standalone carport. He also expressed concern about compliance
with the National
Construction Code and Australian Standards, though this
appeared to be based primarily on insufficient photographs rather than evidence
of actual non-compliance.
[35] I accept
the Applicant's evidence that building approval was in place for the insurance
The distinction Mr Klemm
sought to draw between repairing a carport attached to a house versus
constructing a standalone carport
is not mandated by the scope of work, which
simply refers to "prepare, fabricate and erect carports." The Applicant's work
structural rebuilding, not merely cosmetic repairs.
[36] However, I
am concerned about the reliance on a single project for this scope item,
particularly given the limited documentary
evidence and the fact it was 19 years
ago. Mr Klemm conceded he was "more satisfied" about the work being done
correctly but remained
This is a weak area
in the Applicant's experience profile.
Applicant relies on three deck projects:
[38] Mossman
Public School (2019
Applicant's evidence was that he repaired and resurfaced an existing raised
deck, reinforcing it and covering it with synthetic
grass. While Mr Klemm,
initially, expressed concerns about the lack of engineering certificates or
building approvals, these concerns
appear to have stemmed from his mistaken
belief the work was in Queensland rather than New South Wales.
significantly, Mr Klemm accepted that "a certain level of experience...
particularly in trade skills would be necessary"
for this work. However, this
was repair and resurfacing work, not construction of a new deck from the ground
Saltwater Avenue (2007).
This deck was constructed at the Applicant's
investment property with Mr Barker's involvement. The Applicant provided design
order lists, and photographs. Mr Klemm raised concerns about the bearer
sizing, relying on AS 1684.2
Timber Framing Manual for residential
timber-framed construction.
Applicant criticizes Mr Klemm for importing standards applicable to house floor
construction.
I do not accept
this criticism. Mr Klemm is the only expert witness before the Tribunal
qualified to express an opinion on appropriate
construction standards. His
evidence was that floor system componentry in house design is very similar to
that of a deck, and he
applied the standards
accordingly.
[42] However, Mr
Klemm conceded: "the construction of the deck seems to be indicative of general
tradecraft" and "I'd have to concede"
that the Applicant demonstrated experience
in building a deck, setting aside the bearer sizing issue. Given this concession
fact that the bearer sizing concern related to an abundance of caution
in applying house-floor standards, I am prepared to accept
this project
demonstrates relevant experience, albeit from 18 years ago.

This deck was constructed at the Applicant's home
more than 20 years ago. Three photographs were produced during the hearing.
is minimal documentary evidence about plans, specifications, or building
approvals. There is no evidence from Mr Barker about supervision
Applicant's role.
[44] While I
accept this represents some historical experience, its evidentiary value is
significantly diminished by its age and the
paucity of supporting
documentation.
[45] Across
these three projects, the Applicant has demonstrated some experience with
decking. However, the experience is limited
– one repair project, one deck
built 18 years ago (where expert concerns about sizing were raised), and one
deck built over
20 years ago with minimal documentation. This is an area where
the breadth and currency of experience is concerning.
Prefabricated Sheds
Applicant relies on a single shed project – a prefabricated garden shed on
a concrete slab constructed at his home
at 10 Parkinson Avenue in 2004, more
than 20 years ago.
This work was
not carried out under licensed supervision. The only photographic evidence is an
aerial photograph.
[47] Mr Klemm
accepted that constructing this shed would fall within the scope of work for the
BRSL Licence. However, the question
is not whether one shed falls within the
scope, but whether the Applicant has demonstrated sufficient experience.
[48] Reliance on
a single prefabricated shed built at the Applicant's own property over 20 years
ago, without licensed supervision
or substantial supporting documentation,
represents a significant gap in demonstrated experience.
Fences and Gates
Applicant relies on two projects:
[50] 4 Sunset
Beach Avenue, Yaroomba.
This was a short prefabricated glass pool fence with
associated glass gate at the Applicant's home. Mr Barker was present only for
pouring the slab. The fence involved core drilling for spigots and erecting
glass panels.
[51] Kawana
Shoppingworld.
This was a pool-grade fence of approximately 30 linear metres
around a playground the Applicant had built, with a single outward-opening
[52] Mr Klemm
accepted these fences and gates appeared to be constructed in accordance with
manufacturer specifications and provided
examples of the Applicant constructing
fences and gates within the scope of work. However, he raised concerns that
these were prefabricated
items bought off-the-shelf and simply installed on
site, rather than fences constructed from raw materials requiring greater trade
Applicant correctly notes that the scope of work does not distinguish between
prefabricated and custom-built fences and gates.
However, as noted in
, the licence permits unsupervised work
across the scope, and the experience should demonstrate competence in the types
of tasks and
responsibilities to be undertaken without supervision.
[54] I accept
that the Applicant has demonstrated experience in preparing, fabricating, and
erecting prefabricated fences and gates.
While the experience is limited to
prefabricated items, this, nonetheless, represents practical competence in fence
and gate construction
within the scope of the licence.
Gazebos and Pergolas
Applicant candidly acknowledges he has no experience in constructing gazebos or
pergolas. This represents a clear gap in
experience across the scope of
Ornamental Structures
Applicant relies on one example – a stainless steel sheet ornamental
structure at his home at 4 Sunset Beach Avenue,
Yaroomba. Mr Klemm accepts this
is one example of construction of an ornamental structure within the scope of
work. However, it is
the only example, and there is no evidence from Mr Barker
(the licensed builder noted as responsible) about supervision or the Applicant's
Ponds and Water Features
Applicant relies on one water feature constructed at 10 Parkinson Avenue in
2006. In oral evidence, Mr Klemm accepted this
was a water feature (not merely a
bird bath as he initially thought). However, he emphasized it was a
pre-manufactured item brought
to site and plugged

documentary evidence or detail about the extent
and nature of this work beyond
the Applicant's oral testimony.

noted that tennis and sporting courts are a recent addition to the scope of work
and many structural landscapers would

courts, but the ability would be paralleled in other tasks. He noted aspects
such as site preparation

[66] While the
Applicant's evidence is limited, given this is a recent addition to the scope
and Mr Klemm's acknowledgment that parallel
experience may suffice, I am
satisfied the Applicant has demonstrated adequate foundational experience in
site preparation and concreting
that is at least equivalent to experience in
this scope item.
Prepare Plans and Specifications
Applicant's evidence concerns preparation of plans and specifications for
playgrounds.
The Applicant
stated: "you cannot construct playgrounds or decks without a drawing or a plan
or a guide or dimensions, and those
elements have all been constructed on the
basis of a plan, a set out plan, a dimension plan."
[68] Mr Klemm
reviewed plans referred to in the Applicant's second affidavit and considered
they did not contain sufficient dimensions
and detail to comply with Australian
Standards for technical
He described them as
providing a rudimentary understanding but not being in accordance with the
Australian Standard.
Applicant criticizes Mr Klemm for requiring compliance with Australian Standards
when the Regulation does not mandate this.
The QBCC responds that it would be
inconsistent to require other aspects of work to comply with standards but not
plans and specifications,
and that licensing concerns maintenance of standards
in the industry.
[70] I accept
that Australian Standards provide an objective benchmark for assessing
competence and that building work should generally
comply with relevant
standards to maintain proper standards in the industry (consistent with s 3 of
the QBCC Act). However, the scope
of work refers to plans and specifications
"for the licensee's personal use" or "for building work to be performed by the
personally" – this suggests a more practical, worksite-oriented
approach rather than formal architectural drawings.
Applicant has demonstrated practical experience in preparing plans and
specifications for playground construction that have
been successfully
implemented. While these may not meet formal Australian Standard requirements
for technical drawings, they demonstrate
competence in translating design
concepts into buildable plans for his personal use. I am satisfied this meets
the requirement for
this scope item.
Overall Assessment
each component of the scope of work above reviewed practically and as a whole,
demonstrated the requisite four years' experience
in the scope of work for the
BRSL Licence class?
Applicant has clearly demonstrated:
(a) Extensive and superior experience in playground equipment installation and
construction;
(b) Adequate experience in site preparation, excavation, and concrete work
associated with landscaping;
(c) Adequate experience in constructing retaining walls and structures across
different construction methods;
(d) Some experience in prefabricated fence and gate construction;
(e) Limited experience in artificial landform structures (through playground
(f) Limited experience in tennis courts/sporting courts (through parallel site
preparation and concreting work);
(g) Practical experience in preparing plans and specifications for his own use.
Applicant has demonstrated limited or minimal experience in:
(a) Carports (one project, 19 years old, repair nature);
(b) Decking (repair work, projects 18-20 years old, expert concerns raised);
(c) Prefabricated sheds (one project, 20+ years old, no supervision);
(d) Ornamental structures (one example);
(e) Ponds and water features (one pre-manufactured water feature, 19 years old,
no pond experience);
(f) Irrigation (very limited modification/repair work).
Applicant has no demonstrated experience in gazebos and pergolas.
following criticisms can be made about the applicant’s
experience:
(a) Many projects relied upon are 18–22 years old, raising questions about
currency of experience;
(b) Several projects were at the Applicant's own properties under informal
"reciprocal" arrangements rather than paid commercial
work under licensed
supervision;
(c) Documentary evidence is often sparse, with limited plans, specifications,
approvals, or verification;
(d) There is no evidence from Simon Barker, who was involved in many projects,
(e) Many projects involve installation of prefabricated items rather than
construction from raw materials;
(f) The Assessment Manual (while not binding) indicates experience should be
verifiable, under licensed supervision, and of a competent
standard – much
of the evidence falls short.
[77] The QBCC's
submission that the Applicant has experience primarily in playground equipment,
with very limited experience across
most other scope items, and no experience in
some items, is largely correct.
question is whether this is sufficient. The Applicant's case essentially rests
on the proposition that experience need not
be demonstrated across every item of
the scope, and that significant expertise in one major area (playgrounds)
combined with some
limited experience in various other areas is
sufficient.
must construe the experience requirement having regard to:
(a) The text of the Regulation (which does not expressly require experience in
every scope item);
(b) The objects of the QBCC Act (maintaining proper standards in the
(c) The practical approach required by
(d) The principle that licensing permits unsupervised work across the scope
(e) Section 35(2) of the QBCC Act (suggesting adequate experience across the
scope is normally required);
(f) The availability of equivalent experience under s 5(b)(ii) of the
Regulation.
approach in
asking whether, viewed practically, the experience as a
whole properly constitutes the required years of experience across the entirety
of the scope - provides useful guidance. However, "entirety" must be read with
the practical approach in
and the flexibility for equivalent
experience.
[81] Mr Klemm's
evidence is particularly instructive. He accepted that if an applicant lacked
experience in an item (such as pergola
construction) but had trade knowledge and
the ability to supervise others in that work, it would not preclude licensing.
This suggests
(a) Experience need not be personally hands-on in every scope item;
(b) Trade knowledge and supervisory capability across the scope are relevant;
(c) The key question is whether the applicant can competently and safely
undertake or supervise the work.
[82] However, Mr
Klemm's flexibility was premised on the applicant having trade qualifications
and knowledge. The Applicant in this
case does not have carpentry or building
trade qualifications (though his qualifications exceed the minimum requirement).
His knowledge
and competence must be demonstrated through actual
experience.
critical flaw in the Applicant's case is not that he lacks experience in one or
two scope items (such as gazebos and pergolas),
but rather:
(a) His experience across many scope items is minimal, outdated, poorly
documented, or of questionable quality;
(b) Much of his work was not under licensed supervision in a commercial
(c) Key projects lack verification from the supervising licensed builder (Mr
(d) He has not demonstrated the breadth of experience necessary to safely
undertake unsupervised work across the scope;
(e) Currency concerns arise where significant reliance is placed on work from
18–22 years ago.
[84] While the
Regulation does not specify a time limit for when experience must be obtained,
currency is relevant to whether experience
demonstrates current competence.
Relying heavily on work from two decades ago, without substantial recent
reinforcement, undermines
confidence that the Applicant can currently
competently perform the work.
principle in
at [34] is particularly apt:
The granting of a builder's licence allows the builder freedom to build
unsupervised. ... It follows that the standard of experience
and the breadth of
experience required to licence a builder who seeks to be responsible to the
Queensland community should be higher
than the learning phase of a builder's
career. Evidence of actual experience in such matters as, for example, dealing
with clients,
planning and drawings, actual higher order building skills and
supervision of staff and subcontractors in more than a cursory way
is integral
to the granting of a licence.
Applicant's experience profile suggests someone with deep expertise in one area
(playgrounds) and scattered limited experience
in various other areas, much of
it gained informally on personal properties many years ago. This does not
demonstrate the breadth
and standard of experience necessary to safely undertake
unsupervised structural landscaping work across the scope of the
[87] Applying
a practical approach to the construction of the experience requirement, I am not
satisfied that the Applicant has demonstrated
four years' experience in the
scope of work for the BRSL Licence class.
[88] While the
Applicant has extensive experience in playground construction and adequate
experience in some foundational aspects
(site preparation, excavation, concrete
work, retaining walls), his experience across the broader scope is:
(a) Too limited in many areas;
(b) Too dated in key areas (particularly carports, decking, sheds);
(c) Too poorly documented and verified;
(d) Insufficiently demonstrates the breadth of competence required to safely
undertake unsupervised work across the scope.
[89] The objects
of the QBCC Act require maintenance of proper standards in the building
industry. Granting a licence on this experience
profile would not adequately
serve that object.
[90] This is not
to diminish the Applicant's undoubted expertise in playground construction.
However, the BRSL Licence encompasses
a significantly broader scope of
structural landscaping work, and the Applicant has not demonstrated adequate
experience across that
[91] I note that
the QBCC has discretion under s 35(2) of the QBCC Act to grant a licence with
restrictive conditions where an applicant
does not have adequate experience in
all of the scope of work, but only where the licence is a "new class of licence
under section
42A(1)(a)." There is no evidence before me that the BRSL Licence
meets this criterion, and accordingly, the Tribunal does not have
power to grant
a licence with restrictions on the scope of work.
