FORENSIC REVIEW:
[2019] NSWMHRT 3
Mental Health Inquiry
Mental Health Act 2007
Mr Richard Gulley
Deputy President
DATE OF HEARING:
13 March 2019
XR Hospital
1. Ms Sullivan is in her early forties and has a history of bulimia nervosa
and anorexia nervosa. She presented to ED following a
collapse at home and was
then admitted to the medical ward for assessment. Blood tests showed hypokalemia
and deranged liver enzymes.
The treating team considered her condition to be
life threatening and scheduled her.
2. The cause of the collapse was most likely a cardiac dysrhythmia, secondary
to low potassium caused by Ms Sullivan poor nutritional
Sullivan’s continued to restrict food intake on the medical ward, binged
and purged. Attempts to feed her via a
naso-gastric tube were unsuccessful as Ms
Sullivan pulled the tube out.
3. At the mental health inquiry the treating team requested a six week
involuntary patient order on the basis that Ms Sullivan’s
beliefs around
her weight, that is, that she is at a healthy weight, are of delusional
intensity and her condition is deteriorating
and she is at imminent risk of
death. Ms Sullivan, is in renal failure and is at risk of cardiac arrest
due to low potassium. She
has gained two kilos since admission and the team aim
for Ms Sullivan to gain one kilo a week.
4. The Tribunal determined under
Mental Health Act 2007
that Ms Sullivan:
is a mentally
ill person, and
must be detained
in or admitted and detained in in XR Hospital for further observation or
treatment, or both, as an involuntary patient
unless discharged until a date no
later than 24 April 2019.
REASONS FOR DECISION OF MEMBER
5. (Ms Sullivan) is a 41 year old lady. She has a history of bulimia nervosa
and anorexia nervosa. Following a collapse at her home
she was admitted to the
medical ward of XR Hospital on 2 February 2019 and remained there for treatment
until the 26 February 2019.
On one occasion she absconded from the ward. She is
now an involuntary patient on the Y ward where she was admitted for treatment
2 March 2019. The collapse at home was, it is suggested, as a result of Ms
Sullivan’s poor nutritional intake which caused
her potassium levels to
fall which again placed her at serious risk to herself. During admission Ms
Sullivan has demonstrated a poor
insight into her condition. She would binge on
food brought to the hospital by relatives, she would purge herself and NG tube
was difficult as she would remove the tube placing herself again at
risk. Generally she has not been receptive to educational programs
treatment. However there have been signs of weight gain and increase in her BMI.
Weight gain since admission has been two kilos.
Her BMI is currently 16.
Desirable would be 18. She is 42 kilos. Desirable would be 49 kilos.
6. The Tribunal was satisfied that the patient was suffering from a
condition, namely anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, and that
seriously impairs her mental functioning. It is characterised by a serious
disorder of thought. Her beliefs about her weight
are of delusional intensity.
Her condition without treatment, is one of deterioration. She is at severe risk
to herself due to that
condition. She requires treatment and care and control
for her own protection. There is no other less restrictive alternative.
