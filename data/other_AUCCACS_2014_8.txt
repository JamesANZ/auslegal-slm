Appeal Outcome
Appeal upheld and the respondent to be re-sentenced.[86]
The offending
Between 10:50 and 11:40 pm on 3 November 2012 police observed the offender,
Ms Devine, disobeying a street sign direction to turn
left and then driving the
wrong way down a busy street against the flow of traffic, forcing several other
vehicles to stop suddenly
to avoid a collision. The offender was traveling at 99
kilometres per hour in a 60 kilometres per hour zone. A breath test revealed
that the offender had a blood alcohol content of 0.189, well above the legal
limit of 0.05. As a result of her high BAC, her licence
was suspended
immediately for a period of 90 days.[7]
The offender pleaded guilty and was referred to the Galambany Court for
circle sentencing, a sentencing procedure presided over by
a Magistrate and
involving a ‘hearing panel’ of members of the Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Community,[11] whose
aim is to provide ‘culturally
relevant sentencing option[s] for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
who have offended.'[14]
The offender was sentenced on 12 June 2013. The panel recommended a $1000
fine to cover all the offences, which the Magistrate then
divided among the
particular offences.[11]
The offender also received a two-year licence disqualification and was given
a six-month good behaviour order, which required the
offender to attend
‘educational, vocational or psychological training, particularly in
relation to alcohol.’[12]
The offender’s subjective circumstances
The offender had two previous drink driving offences; the first a low level
offence in 2003 where she exhibited a Blood Alcohol Level
of 0.04, and the
second in 2004 a high level offence with a BAL of 0.16.[9] It was acknowledged
that the offender had 'drug and alcohol
issues'[56] and was currently
participating in counselling sessions.[11]
The Court recognised that the offender looked after her grandmother, who had
dementia, including by driving her to medical appointments.
The Court also
referred to the fact that the offender had left an 'abusive relationship' some
years before the commission of the
offence.[11]
The offender was acknowledged as being 'remorseful' for her actions,[11] and
had ceased drinking after the commission of the offence,
but before the original
sentence was imposed.[80] The hearing panel pointed out the offender’s
need to develop strategies to
maintain abstinence.[11]
The Court found it relevant that, while the offender was employed, she was
not a ‘person with a substantial disposable income.’[83]
Aboriginal Customary Law issues raised
The hearing panel on the original decision raised the importance of
‘spiritual law, cultural law, emotional law, how we take
care of each
other’[54] in relation to the offender’s alcohol abuse. The panel
also mentioned ‘the significance
of Aboriginal law, and the need for the
respondent to find her truth, to find where the pain is in her body and to
become relieved
of it so that she could heal.’[54]
However, on appeal, the Court noted that it was unclear how these
considerations affected the sentence recommended by the panel.[59]
Aboriginal Cultural Practice or kinship issues raised
The hearing panel considered the offender's family network in its, noting the
offender's role in taking care of her grandmother,[11]
and stating that the
offender's mother wanted her to 'sort out her life.'[55]
Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and / or indicators of disadvantage
The hearing panel on the original decision discussed factors including the
offender's drug and alcohol issues,[56] the high rates
of mortality of
Aboriginal people,[55] the significance of Aboriginal law to the offender's
addiction and behaviour,[54] and the
impact on the offender's family, including
her mother[55] and her grandmother.[11] However, on appeal the Court noted that
unclear how these considerations impacted on the sentence the panel
recommended,[59] and held that the sentencing Magistrate did
not, in fact,
exercise her discretion at all when pronouncing the sentence, but merely adopted
the recommendation of the panel.[76]
The main consideration in the appeal was, therefore, the nature of the circle
sentencing process itself. The Court referred to arguments
that the intensive
nature of the circle sentencing process itself was a basis for imposing a more
lenient sentence, with His Honour
noting that the offender was subject to more
personal pressure than is usually the case in a sentencing hearing.[82] Panel
told the offender they would be seeing her ’in community‘
and would be ’looking at her.’[55] His Honour noted
process subjected the offender to pressures from the elders in her community
that were 'more substantial, and, one might
hope, more effective' than an
ordinary offender would face, and accepted that this was a factor that would
lead to a reduced sentence
for those offenders that choose to be sentenced this
The Court rejected the submission by Counsel that the circle sentencing
process places more weight on rehabilitation and less on deterrence
conventional courts.[65] In this regard, his Honour reiterated the principle in
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
that the principle of individualised
justice requires Aboriginal offenders to be sentenced according to their
individual personal
circumstances, including the aspects of those circumstances
that reflect the experience of Aboriginal people, not by reference to
Aboriginality.[68]
The Court noted that the purpose of the panel was to ensure that the
sentencing judge had a proper understanding of the background,
circumstances and
particular disadvantages suffered by the Aboriginal offender, but did not change
in any way the ordinary sentencing
considerations according to the principles of
individualised justice.[67]
Relevant passage:
The circle sentencing process is intended to engage members of the Aboriginal
and Torres Strait community in the sentencing of Aboriginal
and Torres Strait
Islander offenders. This should contribute to the engagement of that community
with the justice system and, even
more important perhaps for the individual
offender, should ensure that the sentencing officer has a proper understanding
of the offender’s
background and circumstances, of the difficulties he or
she has faced and perhaps of the ways in which he or she might be motivated
engage in serious rehabilitation.
On the other hand, the process clearly does not confer the sentencing
discretion on the panel. It is explicit that the offender is
sentenced by the
Magistrate exercising his or her sentencing discretion, and the courts have made
it clear in a succession of cases
that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
offenders are not to be sentenced according to different principles.[67-68]
Grounds of appeal:
the sentence was manifestly inadequate;
the learned Magistrate erred in failing to give reasons for the sentence
imposed; and
the learned Magistrate erred in failing to determine the appropriate sentence
for each offence before considering totality.[6]
Appeal outcome:
finding manifest inadequacy the Court held that the sentences imposed were
inappropriately low and that a new sentence should
be imposed. In making this
decision, the Court took into account a number of aspects of the offences and
the offender’s circumstances
including the offender's prior convictions
for the same offence, aggravating factors such as the high level of intoxication
a significant number of people were put at risk; and the fact that the
sentence imposed was a small fraction of the maximum penalty
for each offence,
at 25 per cent of the maximum for the drink driving offence, and 10 per cent of
the maximum for the other two offences.[80]
This decision was reached despite
the increased pressure inherent in the circle sentencing process and the
relatively low income
of the offender.[82]
The Court found that the Magistrate failed to give reasons, and additionally,
that this was the result of a greater failure to exercise
her sentencing
discretion at all.[27] His Honour noted that there is nothing in Chapter 4C of
Magistrates Court Act 1930
(ACT), the legislation setting up the
Galambany Court and the circle sentencing process, that frees the Magistrate
from the duty of
exercising her own discretion according to normal
principles.[36] His Honour noted that s 291M of the Magistrates Court Act states
that the Galambany Court is simply the Magistrates Court by another name,[33]
and that s 291L defines circle sentencing as merely
a ‘step’ in the
sentencing proceeding.[34] Additionally, Paragraph 49 of the Magistrates Court
Practice Direction 1
of 2012, issued under s 291N(1) of the Act, states that at
the end of the sentencing hearing, the defendant must be remanded to the
Magistrates Court for sentencing.[41] These provisions confirm that the
Magistrate must exercise her normal sentencing discretion,
but with the benefit
of the panel’s input.[35] In this way, the Court held that sentencing
discretion is not delegated to the
hearing panel. The Magistrate must exercise
her discretion properly and give adequate reasons, without merely acting as a
stamp' to a decision actually made by the panel.[74]
Unsuccessful
The Court cited
Johnson v the Queen
[2004] HCA 15
as authority
for the proposition that, while the preferred approach was to set each
individual sentence first, it is also permissible
to accumulate shorter
sentences to achieve an appropriate total sentence.[22] His Honour noted that,
as the concept of 'concurrency'
cannot be applied to fines, the second approach
is the only one that could be applied in this case, and that this approach
necessarily
must mean the total is considered before the individual
sentences.[23] His Honour noted that while the hearing panel expressly did
consider each individual sentence, the Magistrate clearly did apportion the fine
among the three offences.[26]
