Judgment of
Senior Warden Dr Cannon
1 September
Private mine

[2009] SAWC
I note that this private mine
produced in the order of 15,000 tonnes according to Departmental records but
nothing has been done since
resource as to make it important from a mineral resources point of
The private mine has re-vegetated by
natural process rather than an effort of the private mine holder. The private
mine ownership
is separate from the freehold ownership. There are some
outstanding rehabilitation issues and in particular some old sand screen
some old infrastructure, some rubbish and a car body. Clearly, these need to be
removed in a sensitive way that does not
disrupt the re-vegetation that has
occurred. This court has always regarded adequate rehabilitation as a relevant
factor before
a declaration is made that proper grounds exist for a private mine
to be revoked. This has had legislative force since 2001 when
Mining Act 1971
imposed a specific obligation on the holders of private
mines to avoid undue damage to the environment. Proper grounds do not exist
here whilst these environmental issues are not resolved.
I now adjourn this matter out of the list
with liberty to call it back on once I can be assured that the rehabilitation
issues identified
by Senior Rehabiliation Officer, Rino Matiazzo, have been
attended to.
