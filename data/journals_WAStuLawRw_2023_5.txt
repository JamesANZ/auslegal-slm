body’s structure (private or public), or by the function of the power

years since the High Court

review, the scope and reach of quasi-public functions are
broader than ever, particularly in areas such as public cyber security
government data sharing. However, the extension of judicial review to private
bodies in Australia is controversial and uncertain
in its application. This
article argues that the uncertainty regarding the best approach to extending
judicial review to private
bodies is a reflection of varying political and
economic ideologies surrounding the relevance of the Welfare State and what the
of government action should entail. Australian Courts should be empowered
to review quasi-public functions by moving away from a
strict binary
public/private distinction in favour of a faded approach to exercising public
I INTRODUCTION
The High Court in
NEAT Domestic Trading Pty Ltd v AWB Ltd
stated that access to judicial review should be confined to public bodies,
meaning that a person aggrieved by the decision of a private
body exercising
public functions will not be able to rely on public law remedies such as
judicial review.
Almost 20 years
since that decision, important issues of justiciability and jurisdiction remain
unresolved, with academic literature
and case law continuing to consider a
recurring question: what makes a decision justiciable under judicial review? Is
it the public
or private character of the body making the decision or is it the
function of the power being exercised by that body?
Three schools of thought exist when considering what is the function of the
power exercised by a relevant body and what determines
a body’s public or
private character. Firstly, the evolution of case law following
demonstrates that there is a lack of transparency and public accountability for
private companies that perform public
This ‘undoubted
uncertainty’ surrounding the extension of judicial review to private
bodies under the
Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977
’) has not been clarified by Australian
Secondly, it is argued that
this extension reflects, to a degree, a different idea of the Welfare State,
meaning the form of government
that promotes and protects the well‑being
of its citizens. In the case of private bodies exercising public functions, the
is whether or not it would be appropriate to extend a state’s
judicial review powers into the operations of a private company.
Therefore, the
decision in
might be reconsidered soon, given that it reflects an
arguably outdated idea of state functions which are not correlated with the
private or public character of the body. Thirdly, an analysis of the reasoning
shows that courts are well equipped to determine whether a
body’s function falls within a public or private sphere, however,
not the most appropriate forum to decide whether judicial review should be
extended to private bodies. Such an extension
of power is a political decision
and, as such, should be exercised by the executive power of government. This
article argues that
a rigid division between public and private spheres is
inadequate for determining the judicial reviewability of decisions. Instead,
less liberal approach that considers solely the functions performed by private
bodies, rather than relying on their legal form
as well, allows for a more
flexible and adaptive framework in addressing issues of governance and
accountability. This article provides
a summary of the facts of
the Court’s reasoning, before analysing the decision’s impact in
light of the three schools of thought identified.
: AN OVERVIEW
Facts: A Wheat Problem
NEAT Domestic Trading Pty Ltd (‘NEAT Pty Ltd’) was a domestic and
international grain trader, engaged in the business
of exporting durum
In order to export wheat,
NEAT Pty Ltd had to obtain authorisation from the Wheat Export Authority (the

its own wheat.
AWBI operated as a
pool company that would negotiate the sale of wheat overseas that had been sold
to AWBI by other growers, and
consequently, operated as a ‘single
desk’ for the marketing of export wheat from
However, the
Parliament had ‘left open the possibility’ of individual traders
being allowed to export outside of AWBI’s
pools, meaning NEAT Pty Ltd was
AWBI’s competitor.
order to maintain its market share, AWBI applied a strategy of withholding its
consent for NEAT Pty Ltd to export wheat, described
as a ‘blanket policy
of refusal’.

The Context: Privatisation of Public Functions
The primary question for the High Court was essentially whether the
AWBI’s decision would fall within the scope of judicial
In deciding this, the
Court had to consider whether it was the public or private character of the body
that would determine whether
the decision made is of an administrative character
or whether the type of functions exercised by that body are more relevant. This
was a significant question, given that many of the powers and services that were
historically the responsibility of the Australian
government had become
privatised, meaning the implications of this decision affected a number of
private entities exercising public
The question facing
the Court can arguably be considered as a complex one, as the Court had to
decide whether AWBI, a private entity
that was exercising a power given by
statute, was subject to judicial
In determining this issue, the Court in
had to decide which
reviewability consideration should prevail when private bodies exercise public
functions; namely, whether it
is the legal form of the decision-making body, or
the function of the power being exercised that determines whether the decision
can be subject to judicial review. NEAT Pty Ltd contended that AWBI’s
decision was of an administrative character, made under
and thus would have
been reviewable under the
. Ultimately, the Court decided that
the body’s legal form is the correct test in
for two main reasons:
the legal form of the body and the way the statute operates. By examining how
the statute functions, one can
determine the ultimate body accountable for the
decision. By looking at whether the ultimate body accountable for the decision
public or private, it determines whether its decision could be reviewable
. This approach ensures a baseline framework for
evaluating the potential for judicial review of decision-making bodies. These
will be considered in greater detail in the following section.
The Judgment: A Private Body Operating in the Public

, both academic literature and case law have continued to
query whether justiciability should be based on the distinction between
and private bodies or on the function of the power exercised. The main
development to come from the decision in
is that the principle

which states that the reviewability of a decision is determined by whether the
relevant private body’s function is public or
not, has not been applied in
The result is that
multiple private bodies that exercise public functions have been protected from
public scrutiny.
At the same time, Australian courts, with few exceptions, have avoided
deciding whether the
principle could still apply in
This has generated
confusion, as the current Australian position, that the legal form of the body
determines reviewability, is different
from the principle that
suggests ought to apply, being that public function determines
reviewability.

proposed counterargument to this statement is that the High Court in
had an opportunity to adopt this principle in Australia and declined to do so.
Therefore, at the time of writing, judicial review
is not a remedy available for
private bodies, even in the event that they exercise public functions.
The position differs, however, in the context of examination of
Australia’s protection obligations, given the High Court’s

have stated that wherever
there is an alternative source of power, such as a contractual one, it would be
difficult for a court to
justify the extension of its judicial power into the
supervision of private bodies. However, this argument fails to acknowledge that
Australian contract law might not be the best tool to protect rights of parties,
especially when ‘public’ rights are

such as health, education or the environment are considered. Contracts protect

between parties, but third parties may also have
their rights affected without being parties to the relevant contract. One
could be the sublease of a mine site between private companies. It is
unlikely that a private contract between the two companies
could provide broader
protection regarding public environmental and health risks associated with the
exploitation of the mine. A
second issue with this argument is that it is not
clear why it is acceptable for a private body that pursues the commercial motive
of ‘maximising returns’ to be capable of making decisions that may
affect the general public, despite its decisions not
being subject to public
scrutiny through judicial review.
What is undeniable is that there is still uncertainty in the courts. Some

is certain is that the
application of these principles is controversial and depends on the source of
power and the identity of the
body making the decisions.
Judicial Review in a Welfare State: Is the NEAT Decision
Too Liberal?

over the other needs to be weighed with reference to whichever

In that period, the
executive started withdrawing from some governmental functions to the advantage
of private corporations. Therefore,
extending the scope of judicial review into
these types of private bodies would seem a reasonable way to keep a standard of
accountability for the
decision-makers.
However, the
problem with the
principle is that it does not explain what a
public function is and, thus, it relies on judicial comment to determine when a

Therefore the rejection of this principle in
could arguably be seen
as allowing increased government efficiency as these decisions are freed by
review from Courts.
The argument
is that private companies can operate better in fulfilling their designated
functions if they are not burdened with
additional checks and controls that
government agencies have. This approach recognizes that the
decision‑making process can
be streamlined, allowing for quicker
implementation and potentially reducing bureaucratic hurdles, leading to more
efficient outcomes.
The underlying assumption in this argument is that private
companies are capable of carrying out their designated work competently
responsibly, without the need for ongoing judicial oversight, which could be
true if other types of controls, such as auditing,
are in place.
Looking to the future, it is likely that the question left unresolved by the
High Court’s decision in

should be extended to private bodies that exercise public functions, will be
reconsidered. For example,
