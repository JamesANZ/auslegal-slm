REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
1. This is the determination of an application dated 22 October 2010,
pursuant to
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act
(“the Act”), seeking a review of a decision assessing the
applicant’s levy rate for the financial year 2010-2011,
embodied in
correspondence from WorkCover dated 4 June 2010.
, at the relevant time, provided as follows:
(1) Where an employer considers that a decision of the Corporation as
(aa) the estimate of remuneration that is to be used for the calculation of a
(a) the fixing or assessment of a levy; or
(b) the imposition of penalty interest or a fine; or
(c) the imposition or variation of a condition of a kind that may lead to the
imposition of a supplementary levy,
is unreasonable, the board must, on application by the employer, review the
(2) An application for review does not suspend a liability to pay a levy,
penalty interest or a fine.
(3) The review will be conducted, in accordance with procedures determined
by the board, by the board itself, or by a committee or
person to whom the board
has delegated its powers of review under this section, and the board has an
absolute discretion as to whether
it will permit the employer or a
representative of the employer to be heard orally on the review.
(4) On review, the board may—
(aa) alter an estimate;
(a) alter a levy or an assessment;
(b) quash or reduce penalty interest or a fine;
(c) direct the repayment of amounts overpaid;
(d) quash or vary a condition imposed by the Corporation.
(5) An application under this section for review of a decision of the
Corporation—
(a) must, if the decision relates to a class of employer, be made within four
months after notice of the decision was given;
(b) must, if the decision relates to an individual employer, be made within
two months after the employer was given notice of the
unless the Board (or its delegate) allows an extension of time for making the
application.
3. It appears that the application for review was somewhat out of time,
judging by a comparison of the dates of the reviewable decision
application for review. This was not adverted to by the employer in its
application or by WorkCover in its reconsideration
of the disputed decision or
subsequently. It may be that no objection was taken to the time point by
WorkCover, or perhaps no one
noticed. In any event, it is evident that the
application was lodged out of time by a fairly short time (by comparison with
we have considered), and well within the levy year the application
referred to. In other words, the application refers to the levy
the employer was
still paying month by month (unless it is an annual payer, as to which we are
not informed). We do not see any prejudice
to WorkCover in extending time; it
has been perfectly well able to argue its case. In any event, it is a tradition
in the law that
if the respondent to an out of time proceeding does not take the
point, neither does the court. We should not dwell on the matter
further. We
extend time to any extent necessary.
4. Section 67 of the Act, on which the application focuses, at the relevant
time provided (so far as is relevant):
67—Adjustment
of levy in relation to individual employers
(1) The Corporation may, in relation to a particular employer, having regard
to all or any of the following matters—
(a) the adequacy or inadequacy of measures taken by the employer to reduce
the incidence of work related traumas;
(b) the incidence or costs of claims for compensable disabilities suffered by
the employer's workers (disregarding claims of a class
excluded from the ambit
of this paragraph by regulation);
(c) the rehabilitation facilities or services for disabled workers provided
by the employer, or the absence or inadequacy of such
facilities or services
provided by the employer;
(ca) the employer’s practices and procedures in connection with the
appointment and work of a rehabilitation and return to work
co‑ordinator
under Part 3 (including with respect to compliance with any relevant guidelines
published by the Corporation for
the purposes of section 28D);
(d) the employer’s practices as to the retention, employment or
re-employment of disabled workers (and, in particular, any failure
employer’s part to provide, in accordance with this Act, employment to a
worker who has suffered a compensable disability
in the employer's
employment);
(e) such other matters (whether similar or dissimilar to those referred to
above) as the Corporation considers relevant,
grant to the employer a
remission of the levy that would be otherwise payable or impose on the employer
a supplementary levy (as the
case may require). …
5. Broadly stated, the applicant’s ground for its belief that the
assessment in question was unreasonable was that it had not
received an
appropriate remission of levy under section 67(1) as it had enjoyed in previous
years. It was simply charged the base
industry levy for its SAWIC (South
Australian WorkCover Industrial Classification) category. The final levy payable
was therefore
greatly in excess of the total in previous years. This followed
the closure from 1 July 2010 by WorkCover of its former automatic
“bonus/penalty scheme” under the consolidated scheme for the
granting of remissions of levy and imposition of supplementary
levies, known as
the Levy Adjustment Scheme (see
South Australian Government Gazette
August 2009, p.3712), which we will refer to as “LAS09” to
distinguish it from earlier versions of the Levy Adjustment
Scheme and to
provide consistency with references in the case of
SouthLink v.
[2009] SASC 175
(2009) 104 SASR 172
(2009) 184 IR 72.
A preliminary question
6. In accordance with her instructions, Ms Emmett contended at the outset
that there was no reviewable decision, because no decision
under section 67 had
been made. Because of the closure of the bonus/penalty scheme, those responsible
for issuing levy notices for
2010-2011 simply had not turned their minds to
section 67, and in particular to section 67(1)(b), at all.
7. Ms Emmett’s argument was the same as that mounted by her in the case
Salisbury Private Nursing Home v. WorkCover
[2012] SAWLRP 4
which is also published today. Several cases in which aggrieved employers sought
consideration under section 67 were heard over
a short period.
8. The situation in the present case was exactly the same as in
Salisbury Private Nursing Home
, and the arguments mounted by Ms
Emmett were, as we have said, the same. Our view is the same as in that case,
and we need not repeat
it in detail. It is sufficient to say that the decision
under consideration is the “fixing or assessment of a levy”,
the levy notice of 4 June 2010, of which any employer professing a belief that
the decision is unreasonable is entitled to
a review. Such a review necessarily
entails consideration of any discretion that might or might not have been
exercised in the course
of the assessment, and its exercise “afresh and
unimpeded by the manner in which the Corporation exercised the discretion”
— or, in this case, refrained from exercising it: see King CJ,
Santos v. Saunders
[1988] SASC 960
(1988) 49 SASR 556
at 559, in reference to a
different but analogous power of review in the 1986 Act.
9. Accordingly, we proceed to conduct a review of the decision.
Background facts
10. There was no real dispute about any of the facts of this matter. The only
dispute was the conclusions to be drawn from them for
the purpose of exercising
(or not exercising) the discretion. A great deal of documentary evidence was
before us, and sworn evidence
was given by Luke Dominic Foreman, HSQE Manager of
the applicant, and Stefan John Ahrens, Managing Director. We take the basic
from the documents before us and from the helpful outline of argument
prepared by Ms Ashton.
11. The applicant is a business with construction and engineering operations
throughout Australia
particular, at two locations north of Adelaide. The 2009-2010 levy notice shows
location 1 at Sheaoak Log as engaged predominantly
in the SAWIC category
314101 Structural Steel Fabricating
, and location 2 at Mawson Lakes as
411301 Non-residential Building Construction NEC
(not elsewhere counted).
By the time of the 2010-2011 levy notice, the Sheaoak Log location was engaged
316601 Boiler and Plate Work
, while the Mawson Lakes location had been
replaced by a location at Kingsford, near Gawler, with the 411301 coding.
12. Levy notices for the decade from 2001-2002 to 2010-2011 are before us.
These give us an indication of the record of the remissions
previously enjoyed
by the employer under the former bonus/penalty scheme, and in turn this gives a
rough indication of the employer’s
safety record. Because of alterations
from time to time in SAWIC codes and locations, it is convenient to summarise
these in a table.

13. It is to be noted that in 2004-2005 and again in 2006-2007, 2008-2009 and
2009-2010, the employer was a participant in WorkCover’s
“SafeWork Incentive” scheme and the higher adjustment in those years
reflects that incentive. (The SafeWork Incentive
scheme was also closed on 30
June 2010: LAS09, p.3714, item A3.) An earlier levy notice for 2006-2007
indicates that the original
bonus for that year was 20%, reducing the base levy
by 1.5%, and in 2008-2009 15% (-1.125%) applicable to location 1 only. The
rate for location 1 was reduced part-way through the year, but with
retrospective effect, so we have shown the final rate. We are
also bound to
observe that the industry rate of 7.5% for location 3 in 2009-2010 seems to
result from a reclassification on 17 September
2009 (initially
Structural Steel Fabricating
, which carried the 7.5% rate) and is subject to
a further adjustment described as an “interim levy adjustment of change
code/levy rate)” of 2.05%.
14. Ms Ashton said that the employer over many years has strived for
excellence in the fields of occupational health and safety and
management. She said that they have been successful participants in both the
Safety Achiever Bonus Scheme (SABS) and, as we
have noted above, the SafeWork
Incentive Programme for large employers (SWI), earning a bonus of 50% on their
levy calculations.
She said that for the levy year 2004-2005, after successfully
participating in SABS, the employer was invited to participate in SWI
continued to participate successfully in both until those programmes were
15. She said the minimisation of claims costs has been an essential
requirement for participation in SWI since 2004. In this programme,
targets and conditions had to be achieved. Features of the programme, she said,
 All the employer’s business locations must have achieved
conformity with all five SABS performance standards to Level
 Less emphasis was placed on the performance of individual locations
and more on the totality of operations;
 Base levy must exceed $100 000;
 The employer could not withdraw from the agreement during the
agreement period;
 All claims costs, including those for secondary
disabilities, were included in calculations (while other employers had secondary
disability claims excluded from levy calculations), ensuring the employer strove
even harder to achieve the desired results.
16. She said the employer is also independently certified for Australian
Standards 4801 and 14001 and International Accreditation
Standard 9001, in
addition to being highly commended in the National Health and Safety Excellence
Awards in 2010.
17. She said the employer had invested a great deal of time and resources to
ensure the following:
 Policies and procedures are in place to prevent, wherever possible,
workplace injuries;
 All staff have been inducted with these policies and procedures;
 There is ongoing reinforcement at weekly staff meetings, and
“tool box” meetings;
 Monthly communications meetings for all staff occur on site.
OH&S and injury management are addressed at every meeting
by the managing
director, demonstrating the commitment of the company;
 All incidents, whether resulting in injury or not, are promptly
investigated and corrective action put in place immediately
when necessary;
 Staff are surveyed on their knowledge of OH&S and suggestions
are welcomed
 OH&S committee and representatives are in
 Effective hazard management system is in place; risk
assessments and inspection activities are conducted on a regular basis.
18. She said all claims have been managed proactively with emphasis put on a
safe and timely return to work, and the average cost
per claim attests to this.
The early return to work philosophy has been developed and refined over a number
of years to the extent
that it is a “living” ethos within the
19. A bar chart tendered with Ms Ashton’s submission purports to
compare the applicant’s actual claims costs with “industry
claims costs”. It appears to take as “the industry” the
Boiler & Plate Work
classification, although the labelling of the
chart is a little unclear. The source of the figures is not stated, but as
did not object, we will assume they are authentic, perhaps sourced
from WorkCover itself. The vertical axis seems to show dollars,
but the lower
axis is labelled only 1-10. We think these might be intended to represent years.
If our assumptions are correct, years
1 and 3 show the claims costs of the
employer to exceed the industry average significantly (in year 1, massively) but
are very low
in the other years. The chart does not lend itself easily to the
extraction of dollar results. It does seem to emerge that the industry
has also been declining steeply through the period, but not (apparently) as
steeply as that of the employer.
20. On rehabilitation, Ms Ashton said that rehabilitation and return to work
is a commitment from management to all staff. Any injured
staff are provided
with assistance to return to work from either the in-house rehabilitation and
external provider. If necessary, a workplace
assessment or job analysis is conducted. Early contact is made with treating
practitioners
to ensure awareness of suitable duties. A job dictionary has been
compiled to assist with the management of return to work on suitable
duties. She
said a rehabilitation and return to work co-ordinator has been appointed and is
in fact the Manager HSQE (Mr Foreman),
who works closely with management,
workers, the claims agent and providers to make certain a proactive approach is
taken with the
management of claims to ensure that workers are supported during
a claim and in their return to work, and that further aggravations
do not occur.
She said the employer always provides duties within a worker’s capacity
and is active in ensuring a safe and
timely return to full duties wherever
possible. If full duties are not possible, alternative duties are provided
within the worker’s
21. Mr Ahrens told us that the applicant is a family company dedicated to
keeping its people safe. Mr Foreman, as the person with
the most direct
responsibility as national return to work co-ordinator, reinforced this, saying
that during the ten years he had
been with the company he had found it very
focused on safety. This was said to extend beyond WorkCover obligations. Mr
Ahrens told
of one worker who had suffered a motor cycle accident (not
compensable) of whom it was said he would not walk again. He had been
boilermaker. Mr Ahrens said he bought him a computer and the worker is now a
wheelchair basketball player and has qualified as,
and is working as, a
22. Mr Foreman said that one of WorkCover’s SABS auditors had commented
that she had never passed anyone at level 3 before.
23. In response to a question from the Panel as to how many workers have not
been able to be returned to work, Mr Foreman said that
in ten years, all have
returned, except one with a disease who eventually took a redemption of his
24. Mr Ahrens said his family were proud SA people. He lives in the Barossa,
but he regrets opening the Kingsford location. He spoke
of bringing people in
from China to work in other states. He said he was SA Businessman of the Year
two years earlier and a member
of the board of SA Great. He said WorkCover
needed an overhaul and he was “fighting for the whole state”. He
spoke repeatedly
of expanding operations interstate and reducing employment in
this state, and drew attention to a schedule showing rates paid in
25. In answer to cross-examination by Ms Emmett, Mr Ahrens conceded that he
would have done nothing differently in terms of his approach
to occupational
health and safety without the bonuses that had been granted in the past. He said
“We’re not changing,
our investment decisions are.” Money was
still being spent on safety, but this is about being competitive: why should
who treats people poorly get the same deal?
26. Mr Foreman said that the savings from SABS had been used to purchase a
scissor lift. In response to a question from the Panel
reporting, Mr Foreman said the employer tried to focus on both. He regarded a
near-miss as an opportunity to improve.
In response to another question from the
Panel, he said that the company had participated in the RISE (Re-employment
Incentive Scheme
for Employers) scheme some years before, but not currently. He
said even people with disabilities not in the scheme had been employed.
Consideration
27. We note that we were not assisted by the statements, mainly made by Mr
Ahrens, that were political or ideological in nature. This
Panel is a creation
of the system instituted by current Act, and is not in a position to change that
system. Only Parliament can
do that. We are not in a position to take into
account threats to reduce, or cease expanding, the applicant’s workforce
this state or to shift or expand operations into states thought to have
WorkCover schemes more favourable to employers.
28. As we have indicated, our only task in these proceedings is to consider
whether circumstances exist where it is appropriate that
the discretion
conferred by section 67 of the Act be exercised.
29. WorkCover has provided us (book of documents, tabs 36 and 37) with
information enabling comparisons over time and within the industry
classifications (SAWICs) of injury rates and claims costs. The accuracy of the
figures we have extracted may be a little out of synchronisation
because some
figures are expressed as “FinYr” (which we take to mean financial
years running from 1 July to 30 June)
while the claims numbers are expressed in
“AccYr” (which we take to mean accident year, which we assume runs
from 1 January
to 31 December), but we think meaningful trends can be

supplied by WorkCover, no injuries were sustained or claims costs incurred
there. However, the 2010 data refers to the newer location 3 (Kingsford), where

$2 424 327/227 = $10 680
33. A few observations emerge from the three tables. Firstly, the number of
claims per annum have frequently exceeded industry averages,
but the costs
associated with those claims rarely have, particularly in the more recent years
that we regard as the most relevant
years. Secondly, the comparisons could be
considered with greater confidence if we knew whether the operations carried on
applicant were comparable in size with average operations in the relevant
industries.
34. As it happens, WorkCover’s data also includes totals of leviable
remuneration for each of the applicant’s locations
and for the relevant
SAWICs as a whole, which enables a rough comparison of the size of operations.
For example, taking
411301 Non residential building construction
2010, it is possible to calculate that the applicant’s operation at
Kingsford was about 7.3 times the size of the industry
average location,
although in 2009, when that activity was conducted at Mawson Lakes, leviable
remuneration declared for that location
was 5.2 times that for the average
industry location. The operation at Sheaoak Log, which was classified as
316601 Boiler and plate work
in 2010, paid less than half the leviable
remuneration of the average location in that industry. In 2009, when the
operation at Sheaoak
Log was classified as
314101 Structural Steel
fabricating
, its leviable remuneration at that location was 4.6 times that
of the average location in that industry.
35. It is also noted that the applicant’s declared leviable
remuneration at Sheaoak Log in 2009 (under the old classification)
was 9.3 times
the declared leviable remuneration at that location a year later, after the
change of activities, suggesting a sharp
reduction in the workforce at that
location. It may be that many of them were moved to Kingsford, where the
declared leviable remuneration
for 2010 was more than double that for Mawson
Lakes the year before.
36. With this contextual information, it is possible to make further
tentative observations (we say tentative because leviable remuneration
rough indicator of size, and we are not to know the average level of ancillary,
e.g., administrative, staff included in
the leviable remuneration totals). For
example, if the applicant’s
411301 Non residential building
construction
business was five to seven times the size of the industry
average location, the below-average claims rate looks even more impressive.
316601 Boiler and plate work
business was less than half the size of
the industry average location, the claims numbers look worse, but the
below-average claims
costs still look good. If the
314101 Structural Steel
fabricating
business conducted at Sheaoak Log until 2009 was four to five
times the size of the industry average location, context is provided
above-average claims numbers, and the (mostly) below-average claims costs look
even better.
Conclusions
37. We acknowledge that the applicant had been receiving remissions, of
various magnitudes, for many years under the bonus/penalty
scheme and under the
SABS and SWI schemes. It is important to note that these schemes, the
bonus/penalty scheme in particular, were
designed for mechanical application to
a large number of employers on an automatic basis, according to a formula set
out under the
consolidated scheme. Absent these features, there is only the bare
discretion contained in the legislation. Such a discretion cannot
mechanically or automatically. For such a discretion to be exercised in favour
of an applicant, the decision-maker must
feel an “actual
persuasion”
that exercise
of the discretion is appropriate in the circumstances established by the
38. In our respectful view, the applicant in this case is, on balance, a good
employer. Its policies and procedures, and the priority
it seems to give to
occupational health and safety seem impressive, and we would not wish for
anything we say to discourage the applicant
from continuing that approach.
However, we are not satisfied that those policies, procedures and priorities
exceed those that would
be employed by any good employer.
39. The applicant’s claims record (particularly regarding costs, which
is the only measure we have of the seriousness of the
claims themselves) may
have been occasionally uneven but on balance good, and reflects why the
applicant qualified for remissions
for many years under the previous
40. However, in enacting the Act, and the associated
Occupational Health,
Safety and Welfare Act 1986
, Parliament has obviously endeavoured to create
a framework to ensure that all employers should be good employers. Being a good
is supposed to be the norm. And the norm is that an employer pays the
industry rate fixed under
section 66(8).
It cannot be the case that every, or
even most, employers in the state are supposed to receive remissions of levy on
the basis of
being good employers, especially when the Act’s financial
objectives are taken into account. In our opinion, to exercise the
discretion to
remit a levy in whole or in part, we need to be satisfied that an employer is
more than merely a “good employer”.
There must be something that
impresses us as being out of the ordinary to warrant a reward for departing
positively from the norm.
41. We have come hesitantly to the conclusion that the evidence does not
establish this in the present case, and consequently we do
not feel actual
persuasion in this case that it would be appropriate to exercise our discretion
to remit the applicant’s levy
in whole or in part.
42. Accordingly, the application for review must be dismissed and the
reviewable decision (i.e., WorkCover’s original levy notice)
Determination
43. Pursuant to our delegated powers under section 72 of the Act, we confirm
WorkCover’s decision of 4 June 2010.
