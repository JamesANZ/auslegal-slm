REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT
Mr Leo Williams AO – Chairman
Mr Brock Miller – Deputy Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield – Member
This is an appeal by Andrew Spinks, a jockey, against a decision of the
Stewards of Queensland Racing on 25 May 2009 which found him
guilty of the
charge of careless riding pursuant to Rule 137(a) of the Rules of Racing.
His appeal to the First Level Appeals Committee was heard on 10 June and
Spinks appealed to this Tribunal against both conviction and penalty.
He was charged with careless riding following an incident in a race at
Ipswich when the Stewards formed the view that he was not two
lengths clear of a
horse on his inside ridden by an apprentice causing that horse to be
Spinks had drawn the outside alley at the start of an 1100m F & M Maiden
and was working his horse across the front of the field
when the incident
The most reliable evidence is the video which showed that indeed he was not
the mandatory two lengths clear but that the incident
appeared to have been
caused by the apprentice’s lack of control of her mount which surged as
Spinks was almost across.
The apprentice, Jana Piper, in her evidence before the Stewards attributed
the cause of the incident to her own riding.
On the evidence, the Tribunal finds the stewards were correct in making their
finding that Spinks should have been 2 lengths clear
before crossing and
dismisses the appeal against conviction.
The Stewards suspended Spinks for eight meetings. While the conviction can be
maintained solely for the lack of clearance, the check
and subsequent
inconvenience to the inside horse was the result of the apprentice
jockey’s lack of control of her own mount
and Spinks had little part in
the incident. Justice would have been served by a reprimand to Spinks which the
Tribunal finds is the
appropriate penalty.
There was a challenge of sorts in correspondence to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal to hear the matter but it was not argued on the
appeal. It appears
Queensland Racing failed to convene the First Level Appeals Committee within 14
days of the Stewards’ decision
and the First Level Appeals Committee
decided it could not hear the matter. Such has no bearing on the jurisdiction of
this Tribunal
to hear the appeal.
The appeal is dismissed and the sentence is varied to a reprimand.
In the circumstances the Tribunal orders the deposit be refunded.
