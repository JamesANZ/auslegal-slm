REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
decision is about whether the proposed grant of exploration licence E80/5832

) in the Kimberly Region of Western Australia
to Luke Alexander Forti and Clinton Stash Moxham
) is an act attracting the expedited procedure as described in
Native Title Act 1993
December 2022,
of Western Australia
gave notice
of the NTA of its intention to grant the proposed licence to the
Grantee Parties. The ‘notification date’ identified
in the notice
was 9 December 2022 (see
NTA). The notice included a statement that the
State considers that the grant is an act attracting the expedited procedure (see
NTA). By including this statement, the State asserts that the
grant is not likely to, in summary:
directly with the native title holders’ community or social activities
interfere with
areas or sites of particular significance, in accordance with the native title
holders’ traditions (see
involve, or
create rights whose exercise is likely to involve, major disturbance to the land
and waters concerned (see 237(c) NTA).
proposed licence covers an area of approximately 13.08 km² and sits wholly
within the external boundary of the
Yurriyangem Taam determination
80.94% of the area of the proposed licence is subject to a determination of
exclusive native title rights and interests in favour
the Yurriyangem Taam
native title holders
, being the Aboriginal people identified in Schedule 6
Yurriyangem Taam determination
, with the remaining 19.06% of the
licence area is subject to a determination of non-exclusive native title rights
and interests in
favour of the Yurriyangem Taam native title
Both the exclusive native
title rights and interests and the non-exclusive native title rights and
interests coexist with, and are
subject to, ‘other interests’, that
is, non-native title interests. The portion of the proposed licence subject to a
determination of exclusive native title rights and interests is overlapped by
the Tableland pastoral lease, which is held by an Aboriginal
corporation.
The portion of the
proposed licence subject to a determination of non-exclusive native title rights
and interests is overlapped by

trust for the Yurriyangem Taam native title

the grant of the proposed licence. YTAC objects
to the State’s assertions

the objection application was not able to be resolved by the agreement of the
parties, it falls to the Tribunal to determine whether
the expedited procedure
applies (see
[5] Following
the lodgement of the objection, under a delegation from the President of the
Tribunal, Member Eaton was appointed to
constitute the Tribunal for the purposes
of the inquiry into this matter. Member Eaton case managed the matter during its
programming

for the matter, in place of Member Eaton, to determine the matter.
determining whether or not the grant of the proposed licence is an act
attracting the expedited procedure, I must make a predictive
assessment of what
is likely to occur as a result of the grant and decide whether there is a real
chance or risk of interference:
of the NTA generally, see the
applicable legal principles identified in
Yindjibarndi v FMG
which I adopt for the purpose of this determination. In making this assessment I
must look at what is likely to occur as
a result of the grant and decide whether
there is a real chance of interference or major disturbance, having regard to
conferred by the grant, evidence of the grantee party’s
intentions and the operation of the applicable regulatory regime: see
v Western Australia
at [8] – [9] and the cases cited therein.
determine the grant is an act attracting the expedited procedure, the proposed
licence can be granted by the State without
the parties being required to
negotiate with each other (see
NTA). If, however, I determine the grant
is not an act to which the expedited procedure applies,
applies as if the notice did not include the statement and the Grantee Parties
and the State must negotiate in good faith

with YTAC about the grant (see

Information about the proposed licence and the area of
the proposed licence
proposed licence is an exploration licence to be granted under s 57 of the
. Under s 61 of the
, the proposed licence is
granted for a period of five years and may be extended. Section 66 of the
and regulation 20 of the
Mining Regulations
(WA) set out the rights conferred by an exploration licence.
[18] If the
proposed licence is granted, the Grantee Parties will be permitted to undertake
the following activities within the area
of the proposed licence: to enter the
land with personnel and machinery to explore for minerals; to carry out
operations and works
to explore for minerals, including digging pits, trenches,
holes, sinking bores and tunnels to the extent necessary (subject to any
conditions imposed under ss 24, 24A and 25 of the
excavate, extract or remove earth, soil, stone, fluid or mineral bearing
substances not exceeding the prescribed limit of 1000
tonnes, unless approved by
the Minister and subject to any conditions imposed; and subject to the
in Water and Irrigation Act
(WA), to take and divert water from
any natural spring, lake, pool or stream in or flowing through the licence area
or from excavations
made and sink a well or bore from which to take water for
domestic or mineral exploration purposes. The proposed licence is proposed
subject to the endorsements and conditions set out in the draft Tenement
Endorsement and Conditions Extract.
[19] In their
Supporting Information for Tenement Application statement, the Grantee Parties
provide various information, including
in relation to their target minerals
(iron ore mineralisation including hematite, goethite, martite and limonite),
and, the activities
they propose to conduct on the area of the proposed licence
during the term of the proposed licence including geological field mapping,
chip sampling, RAB drilling and RC drilling. The Grantee Parties state they
intend to explore the whole area of the proposed
licence. They indicate that
they intend to conduct four annual field trips during the term of the proposed
licence: in year 1 for
soil and rock chip sampling; in year 2 to conduct
geophysical investigations; in year 3 for RAB drilling; and in year 4 for RAB
RC drilling. The Grantee Parties state that Aboriginal heritage clearances
will be sought before ground disturbing activities are
undertaken; that
rehabilitation of work areas will be undertaken on an ongoing basis or as
required by DMIRS; and that they will
comply with all other relevant statutory
requirements in conjunction with exploration activities including tenement
conditions.
[20] In their
contentions, the Grantee Parties provide further information in relation to the
activities they propose to conduct on
the area of the proposed licence,
including: initially, traversing the area of the proposed licence overland by
foot or by two or
four wheeled motorbikes to sample, map geology and conduct
ground geophysics; based upon results, some non-ground disturbing geophysical
techniques may be used ‘either in the air and supported by ground
personnel’; if shallow drilling is warranted, then
a rubber tyred offroad
vehicle mounted drilling rig would attempt shallow 20 to 200 metre deep drill
holes, with no soil disturbance
intended to take place other than within the 80
to 140 millimetre drill hole locations; and, based upon results, a narrow single
line track and drilling pads may be established for deeper drilling or further
ground geophysical investigations.
[21] The DMIRS
initial material does not identify any Aboriginal communities within or in the
vicinity of the area of the proposed
licence. However, the map attached to Ms
Thomas’ affidavit shows two Aboriginal communities in the vicinity of the
the proposed licence, namely, Yulmbu, approximately 54 kilometres
southwest of the area of the proposed licence, and Janterriji,
approximately 30
kilometres southeast of the area of the proposed licence. These communities are
not otherwise referred to in the
material before the Tribunal and no issue in
this inquiry turns on their location relative to the area of the proposed
[22] The Quick
Appraisal identified the State has previously granted mining tenements,
including exploration licences, which overlap
the area of the proposed licence.
None of these historical tenements are live.
AHIS search, also included as part of the DMIRS initial material, identifies
there are no ‘Registered Aboriginal Sites’
registered under the
Aboriginal Heritage Act
(WA) or ‘Other Heritage
Places’, within the area of the proposed licence.
237(a): Is the grant of the proposed licence likely to directly interfere with
the Yurriyangem Taam native title holders’
community or social
activities?
Relevant principles
v Western Australia
at [26], the Federal Court of Australia explained that
direct interference involves an evaluative judgement that the act, in this
the grant of the proposed licence, “is likely to be a proximate cause of
the apprehended interference”. The Court
also observed that trivial
impacts which are not relevant to the carrying on of the community or social
activities are outside the
scope of the kind of interference contemplated by the
What are the community or social activities undertaken?
[25] YTAC’s
evidence in relation to community and social activities is to be found in the
Thomas affidavit.
[26] In her
affidavit, Ms Thomas identifies that she is a Yurriyangem Taam determined native
title holder in relation to the area
of the proposed licence. Ms Thomas also
I'm connected to this area through my mother's father. My
grandfather's name was
. That's my grandfather’s country. He
lived out there. He came from there and worked at Bedford Downs. He came from
and they gave him a
name, Tommy Springfield. He was a
tribal law man.
That area, including the Tenement Area, is called Lakuwang. The gardiya name
is Chamberlain. My family has a block near the Tenement
Area. I have marked our
block on the map at Annexure PT-1.
Thomas’ evidence is not disputed by the Grantee Parties or the State, and
I accept Ms Thomas has authority to speak
for the area Ms Thomas calls
. In this determination I refer to this area as
[28] There is
nothing in the material before me which identifies the geographic extent of the
area, or a locality called Chamberlain. However, for
completeness, I note the Chamberlian River is clearly shown on both the
topographical
map contained in the DMIRS initial material and on the map
attached to Ms Thomas’ affidavit and marked PT-1. This river is
the northwest of the area of the proposed licence, on the western side of the
Durack Range.
[29] It can be
seen from the map attached to Ms Thomas’ affidavit and marked PT-1 that Ms
Thomas’ family block is located
approximately 17 km southwest of the area
of the proposed licence.
[30] Ms Thomas
identifies a number of community and social activities conducted by Ms Thomas
and her family which Ms Thomas is concerned
will be directly affected if the
proposed licence is granted, including hunting, fishing, collecting and eating
bush tucker and the
intergenerational teaching of these activities. More
particularly, Ms Thomas provides evidence that:
grandfather told her mother before he died that she was connected to the
area, and that her sister mainly has knowledge for the area
including the area of the proposed licence;
Ms Thomas would
take her kids out to the family block every school holidays while Ms
Thomas’ mother was alive;
children would play, swim and go fishing on the family block, and that Ms
Thomas’ children now take Ms Thomas’
grandchildren to the family
block, which is important so that knowledge can be passed on;
the last time Ms
Thomas was out near the area of the proposed licence was maybe four years ago,
but that her son went out over that
country recently in a helicopter with Ms
Thomas’ uncles for a heritage survey;
Ms Thomas and
her family use the waterways running down from the area of the proposed licence
into the Bow River and Pentecost River
for fishing;
Ms Thomas and
her family go hunting for kangaroo, turtle, porcupine, bush turkey, emu and
wallabies near the area of the proposed
Ms Thomas and
her family collect and eat bush tucker including black and green plums known as
, brown sugar bag, tree sugar bag, conkerberry, yams, boab nuts,
bush banana and bush orange ‘out there’, and bush gum
the trees near the river’;
Ms Thomas and
her family ‘[g]et wallabies out there and see lots of birds like finches
and cockatoos’;
that there are
crocodiles near the area of the proposed licence, and that Ms Thomas and her
family ‘want to protect the animals
that live in the wild’; and
that Ms Thomas
thinks there are burials along the Durack Range but that this area would need to
be checked.
Contentions of the parties
contends there is a high likelihood the grant of the proposed licence will
interfere directly with the community and social
activities identified by Ms
Thomas for essentially three reasons. First, YTAC argues that any drilling or
excavation ‘in and
around’ the area of the proposed licence is
likely to detrimentally affect the ability of the native title holders to access
and use the area for community and social activities. Secondly, YTAC argues that
if the Grantee Parties use the area, including through
the use of machinery or
vehicles when they are exploring, without the knowledge of the native title
holders, it may disrupt the movement
habits of the wildlife moving through the
area of the proposed licence and that this disruption is likely to interfere
with the willingness
of the native title holders to access the area and
undertake the community activities identified in Ms Thomas’ evidence. And
thirdly, YTAC argues any associated environmental impacts on the interconnected
river systems of the area as a result of the exploration
activities will reduce
the availability of, and discourage the use of, resources in the waterways
flowing through the area of the
proposed licence.
[32] The Grantee
Parties contend the proposed licence will not interfere with the community and
social activities identified by Ms
Thomas. They argue it is ‘extremely
unlikely’ they and the native title holders will be present on the area of
the proposed
licence at the same time as the Grantee Parties due to the seasonal
nature of exploration activities and the infrequency of Ms Thomas’
family’s visits to the family block and, in any event, because the
evidence does not indicate that the community and social
activities are
conducted on the area of the proposed licence. The Grantee Parties further argue
their proposed ground-based exploration
activities, including advanced
activities including drilling, will not hinder access to area of the proposed
licence, and, that the
endorsements and conditions to be imposed on the proposed
licence and the legislative and regulatory requirements applicable to the
proposed licence are sufficient to address Ms Thomas’ concerns about
impacts on wildlife and the environment.
[33] Like the
Grantee Parties, the State contends the proposed licence will not interfere with
the community and social activities
identified by Ms Thomas. The State argues
YTAC’s concerns fall into two categories, namely: concerns about the
ability of the
native title holders to access the area of the proposed licence
to carry out the community and social activities identified by Ms
Thomas; and
concerns about the impact of the activities which will be permitted under the
proposed licence on wildlife and waterways
and, in turn, the impact of these
activities on the native title parties’ community and social activities in
relation to wildlife
and waterways.
[34] Regarding
the first category of concern, the State contends that while there is evidence
that community and social activities
are conducted on Ms Thomas’
family’s block and near the area of the proposed tenement, these
activities are conducted
sporadically and, in any event, there is no evidence
these activities are conducted within the area of the proposed licence. On these
bases, the State argues that the native title holders’ ‘ability to
continue using the general area in the way that it
currently does will not be
interfered with by the grant of the [proposed licence]’.
[35] Regarding
the second category of concern, the State contends there is no evidence the
exploration activities which will be permitted
if the proposed licence is
granted will impact upon wildlife and waterways in the way YTAC contends and, in
any event, the proposed
licence will be ‘subject to endorsements in
relation to the protection of native vegetation, and minimisation of damage,
disturbance
or contamination of waterways...’
Consideration
– is interference with the community and social activities likely?
[36] I have
considered Ms Thomas’ evidence and the contentions of the parties in
relation to community and social activities
identified by Ms Thomas. While I
accept Ms Thomas’ evidence and acknowledge YTAC’s concerns about the
potential for interference,
on the evidence provided I am unable to find that
the grant of the proposed licence is likely to directly interfere with the
and social activities.
[37] I accept
the community and social activities Ms Thomas has identified take place from
time to time in and around the area of
Ms Thomas’ family’s block
and, in some instances, take place ‘near’ the area of the proposed
licence. However,
the evidence is not sufficiently specific for me to be
satisfied that the community and social activities identified by Ms Thomas
place within the area of the proposed licence, which is the only area where the
Grantee Parties will be permitted to conduct
exploration activities if the
licence is granted. It follows that I am unable to agree with YTAC’s first
contention that any
drilling or excavation ‘in and around’ the area
of the proposed licence is likely to detrimentally affect the ability
native title holders to access and use the area for community and social
activities.
[38] Moreover, I
am unable to agree with YTAC’s second contention, essentially that the
Grantee Party’s exploration activities
disrupt the movement
habits of the wildlife moving through the area of the proposed licence and that,
were this disruption to occur,
it would likely interfere with the willingness of
the native title holders to access the area and undertake the community and
activities identified by Ms Thomas, nor with YTAC’s third
contention, essentially that
associated environmental impacts on the
interconnected river systems of the area as a result of the exploration
activities will reduce
the availability of, and discourage the use of, resources
in the waterways flowing through the area of the proposed licence, as I
these contentions to be speculative on the evidence provided.
[39] Accordingly,
on the evidence provided, I consider the grant of the proposed licence is
unlikely to cause interference within
the scope of s
Section 237(b): Is the grant of the proposed licence
likely to interfere with areas or sites of particular significance according
the Yurriyangem Taam native title holders’ traditions?
Relevant principles
area or site of particular significance is one of special or more than ordinary
significance to the native title holders in
accordance with their traditions
Cheinmora v Striker Resources
at page 35). It must be known,
able to be located and its significance able to be explained to the Tribunal
Yindjibarndi v FMG
Areas identified by
[41] The areas
or sites which YTAC expressly contend are of particular significance within the
scope of s 237(b) are:
a dingo dreaming
near the area of the proposed licence.
[42] YTAC also
advert to Ms Thomas’ evidence about possible burials along the Durack
Contentions of the Grantee Parties
[43] The Grantee
Parties argue YTAC has not identified any sites of particular significance.
[44] The Grantee
Parties accept Ms Thomas has identified in the
area an area of
significance which is much wider than the area of the proposed licence but
argues that this area ‘covers many
hundreds of kilometres in description,
with no specific description provided of anything that might relate to the area
that the tenement
covers’. Relatedly, the Grantee Parties
With no specific landmarks mentioned by the Native Title
Party it is difficult for the Grantee Party to ascertain whereabouts the
of significance occur within the bounds of the tenure which is very small by
comparison to the bounds of the determination.
It could be any place, in any
direction from the description provided.
[45] The Grantee
Parties also accept that Ms Thomas has identified a dingo dreaming near the area
of the proposed licence but argue
that they have no interest in any area outside
the area of the proposed licence.
Contentions of the State
[46] Like the
Grantee Parties, the State also argues that YTAC has not identified any sites of
particular significance.
[47] The State
makes no contentions with respect to the
area. However, the
State accepts that there may be a dingo dreaming near the area of the proposed
licence, but argues that YTAC has
not sufficiently identified its location.
[48] The State
also accepts that if there are burial sites within the Durack Range, then these
could be sites of significance for
YTAC but says there is no evidence as to
where within the Durack Range these burial sites are located.
YTAC’s evidence and contentions - Lakuwang area
respect to the
area, YTAC contends that the labelling of this
area by Ms Thomas as ‘my grandfather’s country’ identifies
as Ms Thomas’ local estate area or
‘serious cultural responsibility attaches’. YTAC contends
In this sense,
, including the Tenement Area,
is an area of particular significance to the deponent and her family, in the
sense contemplated by
[50] Relatedly,
YTAC contends that Yurriyangem Taam native title holders derive rights and
interests within their broader determination
area under their system of
traditional laws and customs through descent to local estate areas or
countries, and that looking after and protecting these local estate areas is
one of the main responsibilities for Yurriyangem Taam
native title holders and a
very serious responsibility.
Consideration – Lakuwang
[51] While I
accept Ms Thomas’ evidence in relation to the
area, in my
view the evidence does not support a finding that this area is an area of
particular significance within the scope of
s 237(b) for two reasons.
First, the geographic extent of the
area is unclear on the
evidence provided, save that I understand it to be a large area relative to the
area of the proposed licence
and one which includes the area of the proposed
[52] Secondly,
it is not apparent from the evidence provided why this area has special or more
than ordinary significance to the Yurriyangem
Taam native title holders in
accordance with their traditions, over and above other areas of their country.
As was recognised in
Yurriyangem Taam determination
, the Yurriyangem
Taam native title holders derive rights and interests within their broader
determination area under their system
of traditional laws and customs through
descent to local estate areas or
countries, and, looking after and
protecting these local estate areas is one of the responsibilities of the
Yurriyangem Taam native
title holders under their laws and customs. However, on
the evidence provided, I am unable to find that the derivation of rights
interests in this way, and the responsibilities which ensue from this (as
important as they are), elevate the local estate area
Ms Thomas and her family to the status of an area of particular significance
within in the meaning of s 237(b). In my view,
additional information would be
required before such a finding could be made.
[53] In the
result, more information in relation to both the location of the
area and its particular significance in accordance with the traditions of the
Yurriyangem Taam native title holders would be required
for me to be able to
find this area is an area of particular significance for the purpose of s
[54] That I
could not be satisfied of either the location or particular significance of the
area for the purpose of s 237(b) does not detract from the
significance of this
area to Ms Thomas and her family, which I accept
without reservation.
YTAC’s evidence and contentions -
Dingo dreaming
respect to the dingo dreaming Ms Thomas provides the following direct
There is a dingo dreaming near the Tenement Area where
they want to dig. The Explorer shouldn’t go near that dreaming. If you
there you get sores all over your body. That dreaming should not be close to
My Aunty told me that some people out there drilling were mobbed by flies.
That might happen if the Explorer tries to do that.
Consideration – Dingo dreaming
[56] While I
accept Ms Thomas’ evidence in relation to the dingo dreaming, I am of the
view that this evidence is insufficiently
detailed for me to make any findings
in relation to this area within the scope of s 237(b).
The location of
this dreaming has not been described beyond that it is ‘near’ the
area of the proposed licence. Furthermore,
while Ms Thomas has identified
certain spiritual dangers she and her family associate with the dreaming, Ms
Thomas has not explained
why this dreaming is of more than ordinary significance
to the Yurriyangem Taam native title holders in accordance with their
traditions.
[57] In the
result, more information in relation to both the location of this dreaming and

with the traditions of the Yurriyangem
Taam native title holders would be required for me to be able to find an area or
site associated

of s 237(b) (see
Andrews v Northern Territory
at [124] and
YTAC’s evidence and contentions – possible
burials along the Durack Range
her affidavit Ms Thomas states:
The old people are gone now, but I
think there are burials along the Durack Range. We have to check that area.
[59] In its
primary contentions YTAC states:
The NTP’s evidence states
that there may be “burials along the Durack Range”.
[60] I infer
that YTAC refers to this evidence on the basis that any area or areas where a
burial has occurred would be a site of
particular significance to the
Yurriyangem Taam native title holders.
Consideration –
possible burials along the Durack Range
Tribunal has previously accepted that burial sites may be sites of particular
significance notwithstanding a lack of evidence
describing the specific
connection between the site and the laws and customs of the native title
holders: see
Western Australia v Naagaju Peoples and the Mullewa Wadjari
[62] However,
because Ms Thomas’ evidence only speaks to the possibility of
‘burials along the Durack Range’ and
that this is something which
would need to be checked, and, it necessarily follows, there is no evidence of
any such site being located
in, or materially close to, the area of the proposed
licence, I am unable to make any finding for the purpose of s
Question of likelihood of interference does not
[63] As no area
or site of particular significance has been identified within the scope of s
237(b), the question of likely interference
as a result of the grant of the
proposed licence does not arise.

Relevant principles
principles to be considered when determining whether the proposed licence is

‘major disturbance’ is to be given its ordinary English meaning as
understood by the whole Australian community,
including Aboriginal people. The
concerns of the Aboriginal community including matters such as community life,
customs, traditions
and cultural concerns are relevant matters for consideration
in evaluating the disturbance; and
the Tribunal is
entitled to have regard to the context of the proposed grant, including the
history of mining and exploration in the
area, the characteristics of the
relevant land and waters, as well as the remedial regulatory regime in
Evidence and contentions of the parties
[65] In the face
of the Grantee Parties’ proposed exploration activities, YTAC contends in
its primary contentions that these
activities are likely to constitute a major
disturbance within the meaning of s 237(c) due to ‘the serious risk of
interference
with the habitat and movements of finches including the Gouldian
Finch, which is known to inhabit the Kimberley Region, and wallabies
the Spectacled Hare-wallaby, which are known to inhabit Tableland Station (in
which the Tenement Area) lies’.
contending, YTAC relies on Ms Thomas’ evidence in relation to the presence
of wallabies and finches ‘in and
around the Tenement Area’, as well
as the material listed at
the extent this material concerns the Gouldian Finch and Spectacled
Hare-wallaby.
convenient to record at this point that I do not consider Ms Thomas’
evidence goes so far as to establish the presence
of finches and wallabies in
the area of the proposed tenement. Rather, I consider Ms Thomas’ evidence,
on its face, establishes
the presence of these species near the area of the
proposed licence. However, I am willing to infer from Ms Thomas’ evidence
that it is possible that species such as finches and wallabies are present in
and around the area of the proposed licence.
respect to the Gouldian Finch, YTAC contends in its primary contentions:
Gouldian Finch is listed as endangered under the
Environment Protection and
Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
that, according
to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water’s
species profile and threats database,
the Gouldian Finch is sparsely distributed
across northern Australia between the Kimberley and north-central Queensland,
historically observed in flocks of thousands but its total population is
now estimated at less than 2500, with threats to the species
including frequent
and extensive fire, heavy cattle grazing and aviculture; and
appendix to the national recovery plan for the Gouldian Finch states that
infrastructure developments including transport
corridors and mining activity
may play a role in regional Gouldian Finch population declines.
respect to the Spectacled Hare-wallaby, YTAC contends in its primary
contentions:
that according
to the Wysong et al study, small, isolated and declining populations of the
Spectacled Hare-wallabies now occur in
the Pilbara and Kimberly regions of
Western Australia; and
Spectacled Hare-wallaby is listed as a priority four species under the
Biodiversity and Conservation Act 2016
(WA) and that a native species is
listed as a priority four species if it is rare, or near threatened or in need
of monitoring.
[70] YTAC also
contends in its primary contentions that the Grantee Parties’ proposed
exploration activities will involve a
major disturbance to the habitat,
behaviour and population of birds and wallabies in and around the area of the
proposed licence,
making it difficult to monitor and protect finches and
wallabies and interfering with YTAC’s desire to ‘protect animals
that live in the wild’.
[71] In its
reply contentions, YTAC summarises its position in the following
In relation to the tenement area, the NTP contends that the
evidence establishes the presence of two species which are listed as rare
endangered, and, in the case of Gouldian Finches, that mining activities can
have impacts on their population. In this sense,
the NTP contends that there is
a likelihood of major disturbance to the populations of Gouldian Finches and
Spectacled Hare-wallabies,
in the sense contemplated by section 237(c).
[72] In their
contentions, the Grantee Parties argue that to cause major disturbance would
involve moving significant amounts of earth
and vegetation; that the cost of
this would be significant with respect to the aggregate spend undertaken to
reach this stage of
exploration; that the probability of discovering minable
minerals is low, and, therefore, that the probability of resource scale
earthworks and/or vegetation clearing is low.
[73] In its
contentions, the State argues that
the evidence before the Tribunal in
relation to the risk posed by mining to wildlife habitats is limited to general
statements in
the appendix to the national recovery plan for the Gouldian Finch;
that these statements indicate it is possible that local Gouldian
populations may be affected by mining activity or infrastructure development but
that this evidence does not articulate the
nature or extent of this risk or the
kind of mining activities and infrastructure development that could create it,
nor does it demonstrate
how the grant of the proposed licence is likely to
result in major disturbance to land or waters which in turn would affect the
habitats as contended by YTAC.
The State also argues that, in
any event, the Grantee Parties’ proposed exploration activities would not
constitute ‘major
disturbance’ in the ordinary English meaning of
Consideration – major disturbance
[74] I accept Ms
Thomas’ evidence that she and her family ‘get wallabies out there
and see lots of birds like finches
and cockatoos’, and, as noted, I am
willing to infer that these species may be present in and around the area of the
[75] However, I
consider there is insufficient evidence for me to be satisfied of each of the
findings YTAC essentially contends for:
first, that Gouldian Finches and
Spectacled Hare-wallabies, in particular, are present within the area of the
proposed licence; secondly,
that the particular exploration activities the
Grantee Parties propose to undertake in the area of the proposed licence will
involve major disturbance to the land or waters of the area of the
proposed licence; and thirdly, that this major disturbance will,
involve major disturbance to the habitat, behaviour and population of these two
particular species.
[76] Even if I
were to infer the presence of Gouldian Finches and Spectacled Hare-wallabies in
the area of the proposed licence on
the basis of the general information
provided confirming the presence of these species in the Kimberley region and,
in the case of
the Spectacled Hare-wallaby, on Tableland Station, I do not
consider, in the circumstances of this matter, that the exploration activities
which the Grantee Parties propose to undertake amount to activities which are
likely to involve ‘major disturbance’ to
the land or waters within
the area of proposed licence.
[77] Moreover,
and in any event, there is insufficient evidence for me to be satisfied of a
causal connection between the exploration
activities that the Grantee Parties
propose to undertake, on the one hand, and likely major disturbance to the
habitat, behaviour
and populations of wallabies and finches but particularly the
two species of concern, on the other. While I am not satisfied the
exploration
activities of the kind the Grantee Parties propose to carry out are
to affect either of the species of concern so as to cause major
disturbance in the manner contended, I accept the general information
identifies that ‘infrastructure developments including transport corridors
and mining activity
play a role in regional Gouldian Finch population
declines’ (emphasis added).
[78] In light of
these particular matters, and having regard to the circumstances of this matter
more broadly, including -
the nature and
extent of the exploration activities the Grantee Parties will be permitted to
undertake in the area of the proposed
licence, if the licence is granted;
the nature and
extent of the exploration activities the Grantee Parties propose to undertake in
the area of the proposed licence,
if the licence is granted (cf, for example,
the nature and extent of the more impactful exploration activities considered
by, respectively,
Member O’Neill in
Re Tjupan Peoples
, and Deputy
President Seaman in
Re Nyungah People
, which in each case founded a
finding of likely major disturbance);
characteristics of the land and waters of the area of the proposed licence (cf,
for example, the special characteristics, including
the cultural significance,
of the land and waters considered by Member Cooley in,
Ipima Ikaya v
Ipima Ikaya v
, which in each case founded
a finding of likely major disturbance); and
the conditions
and endorsements proposed by the State and the applicable regulatory controls
such as those under the
Aboriginal Heritage
I find that the exploration activities the
Grantee Parties propose to undertake in the area of the proposed licence are not
to involve major disturbance to the land or waters within the area of the
proposed licence within the scope of s 237(c).
Significance of exclusive native title rights within the area of the
proposed tenement
[79] In its
reply submissions, YTAC contend, on the basis of Deputy President Sumner’s
observations in
Western Desert Lands Aboriginal Corporation v Western
at [163], that ‘increased weight should be given in analysis
to the native title holders’ interests, proposals, opinions
or wishes in
relation to the management, use or control of the land where native title is
determined and the native title holders
have the right to possessor use the land
to the exclusion of all others’.
understand that YTAC makes this contention within the context of each limb of s
Deputy President Sumner’s observations were made in the context of the
Deputy President’s consideration of
the criterion in s 39(1)(b) of the NTA
in the course of determining, pursuant to s 38, a future act determination
application made
under s 35, rather than in the context of s 237, the Tribunal
has previously taken into account the holding of exclusive native title,
other factors, in finding likely major disturbance within the scope of s 237(c)
Ipima Ikaya v
at [150] and
Ipima Ikaya v
[82] In this
case, the fact that the Yurriyangem Taam native title holders hold exclusive
native title over the majority of the area
of the proposed licence is a
consideration I have taken into account, among others, when determining whether
the grant of the proposed
licence is an act to which the expedited procedure
applies. In the final result however, having regard to the evidence which has
been provided and the broader circumstances of this matter, this consideration
has not caused me to change my view that, for the
reasons variously provided
above, the grant of the proposed licence is an act which is unlikely to cause
interference within the
scope of s 237(a) and s 237(b), nor major disturbance
within the scope of s 237(c).
Determination
[83] I determine
the grant of exploration licence E80/5832 to Luke Alexander Forti and Clinton
Stash Moxham
is an act attracting the expedited procedure.
