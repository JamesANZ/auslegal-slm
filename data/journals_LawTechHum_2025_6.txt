such as safety concerns, ethical issues, quality

safety, efficacy and ethical compliance while fostering innovation.
Section 2 details the technology’s processes, applications and future
potential. Section 3 builds on the dominant narratives
shaped by Brownsword,
Lessig, Somsen, Jasanoff, Yeung and Bennet Moses, to name a few. Section 4
examines the correlation between
these narratives and the current EU regulatory
landscape applicable to biomedical technologies and their relevance to
bioprinting.
Section 5 offers legal perspectives on bioprinting, including
potential regulatory pathways and specific challenges.
The main finding of the article posits that there is piecemeal legislation
that can only address specific aspects of technology. However,
due to the dual
nature of bioprinted products, the European Union might not be equipped to
handle the complexities of 3D bioprinting

The mentioned dual

while, as Jasanoff observes,
the legal focuses on entitlements of life that come
with scientific breakthroughs.
Besides this, bioprinted products can serve various therapeutic and cosmetic
applications. They can also be a component of medical
devices and prosthetics.
Thus, the article identifies three potential scenarios for 3D bioprinting in the
European Union.
The primary methodology employed is doctrinal legal research, augmented by
normative analysis and insights from regulatory theory.
The article rigorously
analyses existing EU legal frameworks to interpret their implications for the
emerging field of 3D bioprinting.
By scrutinising legal texts and pertinent
definitions, it assesses the current legal landscape’s adequacy in
addressing the
complexities of bioprinting. Furthermore, it adopts a normative
perspective, advocating for adaptive regulation as a more fitting
legal strategy
in response to the dynamic nature of bioprinting technologies. Additionally, the
analysis employs a narrative-based
approach to critique and compare prevailing
regulatory paradigms, including harmonisation and adaptive regulation, through a
constructivist
lens that emphasises the intersection of legal scholarship and
governance theory. This multifaceted methodological framework aims
to illuminate
the evolving regulatory challenges posed by bioprinting and propose pathways for
more effective legal oversight.

living human cells into scaffolds in a controlled environment.
biofabrication technology that can overcome the difficulties of producing an
exact mimic of native tissues since authors
agree that placing multiple types of
cells in a designed matrix could bring us closer to making more complex human
To bioprint effectively,
besides the bioprinting machine, ink made of human cells and a hydrogel to
provide a living environment
for the cells are also essential. The CAD file
contains the blueprint of the tissue we want to print, and bioinks must be
placed in the scaffold. The CAD files or blueprints for tissue
printing allow for the creation of anatomical structures that, in
function and
design, mimic natural organs and tissues. Bioprinting is a patient-specific
technology where printed tissues mimic the
patient’s and thus reduce the
chances of rejection.
The process starts by extracting cells from the patient to create ink. Cells
are autologous when the donor and recipient are the same
person. In the case of
autologous cells, the immune system recognises them as non-hostile and does not
attack them after transplantation.
The extracted cells are then differentiated,
cultivated and replicated to create bio-ink or cell
Scaffolds play a critical role
in bioprinting tissues. The purpose of scaffolds is to support the cells placed
in designated positions.
It provides an environment where they can live, bind
and form tissues. Depending on the type of technology, there are different types
of scaffolds.
Conditional to their
properties, scaffolds can be synthetic or natural, whereas ‘synthetic
hydrogels have become more readily
adopted than natural polymers because of
their greater water absorption capacity, longer shelf life, and wide varieties
of chemical
resources that are
available’.
Printing an entire organ is still not feasible due to the complexity of
tissue structures within organs.
Fully functional organs require various components that must be printed, such as
connective tissues, vascularisation and neural

regeneration.
Incorporating cells into 3D constructs enables personalised drug testing and
disease management. Companies such as Aspect Biosystems
are developing
bioprinted lung tissue and exploring treatments for diseases such as type 1
diabetes. Advances in personalised prosthetics
include bioprinted ears using
bioink for cartilage, combining precision and autologous
reconstruction.
In Europe, 3D bioprinting is transforming medicine. The BRIGHTER project at
the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) is
developing functional
tissues such as skin with sweat glands and hair follicles for medical use and as
alternatives to animal testing.
Partnering with Goethe University Frankfurt, the
project also focuses on neural tissue printing, tracheal scaffolds and cardiac
for patient-specific
Researchers are further creating organ-on-chip models to simulate human organ
environments, reducing animal testing and accelerating
development.
Some of the so far
approved tissue-engineered products in the European Union are
RenNovaCell Skin autologous (epithelial
cell) harvesting device as skin

and CardioCel Acellular collagen matrix-based

These examples highlight the diverse and impactful applications of 3D
bioprinting, underscoring its potential to transform healthcare
and biomedical
research. Research and investment in this promising technology are growing, and
it is only a matter of time before
scientists perfect the methods to print the
entire transplantable organ. At the same time, regulators should prepare to
address the
technology and prepare healthcare systems and markets for its
impact. As noted earlier, this technology is related to tissue engineering
regenerative medicine; accordingly, the regulatory approaches and frameworks for
these technologies apply to bioprinting. However,
this article will show that
this is only partly the case.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) classifies bioprinted products under the
Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP) framework.
This framework is part of
Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 and Directive 2001/83/EC, providing the legal
basis for ATMPs in the European
Union. This framework encompasses gene
therapies, somatic cell therapies and tissue-engineered products, ensuring that
they undergo
rigorous evaluation for safety, efficacy and quality. The
classification under the ATMP framework allows for a comprehensive and
centralised assessment by the EMA involving the Committee for Advanced Therapies
(CAT). The CAT issues scientific recommendations
on the classification of ATMPs
and follows scientific developments to ensure these innovative therapies meet
stringent standards.
The two main phases in the lifecycle of biomedical technology are research
and development (R&D) and clinical deployment in patient
care. These phases
are typically regulated under different systems, involving distinct regulatory
authorities, such as ethics committees
and research funders in the R&D phase
and agencies such as the EMA and national health regulators in the healthcare
phase. This
article examines 3D bioprinting technology in both phases due to the
translational integration between the phases, as it is a crucial
connecting different phases of medical research and patient care. Specifically,
it highlights the importance of ensuring
that valuable insights, data and risk
assessments derived from R&D are effectively transferred to the clinical
phase, where these
findings can directly impact patient care. Conversely, it
also emphasises the necessity of channeling information from the clinical
experience into R&D initiatives. This reciprocal flow of information
enhances the regulatory framework, enabling a more agile
and evidence-based
approach to healthcare regulations. For instance, post-market surveillance data,
including real-world patient
outcomes, can provide critical feedback that
informs future research and policy-making. By fostering this integration,
systems can better adapt and respond to emerging evidence and patient
needs, ultimately improving health outcomes. It is worth noting
that while the
ethical concerns in the biomedical R&D phase revolve around the responsible
conduct of experimentation, balancing
scientific advancement with the
minimisation of harm and safeguarding the autonomy of research participants
through rigorous consent
protocols, the patient care phase shifts the ethical
lens towards ensuring equitable access, clinical transparency and the
prioritisation
of individual well-being, thereby underscoring a transition from
population-level innovation ethics to the intimate obligations of
personalised
therapeutic responsibility.
Biomedical technology, with its potential to revolutionise healthcare, poses
significant regulatory challenges. The narratives surrounding
technological
progress and neutrality shape regulatory frameworks and influence perspectives
on the governance of these innovations.
By contrasting different regulatory
approaches and highlighting the importance of ethical, social and legal
considerations in biomedical
technology regulation, the next section of the
article explores the theoretical framing as narratives within which legislation
be examined.
3. Dominant Discourses in Technology Regulation
One of the predominant discourses in technology regulation is the belief in
technological progress as a catalyst for a better future.
This perspective
posits that technological advancements inherently lead to societal improvements,
thus warranting minimal regulatory
interference. Proponents of this view often
argue that regulation stifles innovation and delays the benefits that new
technologies
can bring. Techno-regulation refers to intentionally influencing
individuals’ behaviour by embedding norms into technology;
it thus extends
beyond the traditional legal
frameworks.
Design-based
regulation involves shaping the environment or products to manage behaviour or
mitigate risks. Van den Berg and Leenes
found that this approach can be more
effective than traditional regulation in specific contexts, as it can directly
shape behaviour
without needing external enforcement.
Lessig’s famous assertion that ‘code is law’ affirms that
technology can be a form of regulation. Thus, regulatory
frameworks should be
agile and responsive to technological developments as technology drives societal
techno-regulation is an intentionally built-in mechanism influencing
people’s behaviour.
Techno-regulation also incorporates the concept of ‘nudge’,
developed by behavioural economist Thaler and legal scholar
Sunstein. For them,
a nudge ‘is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters
people’s behaviour predictably without
forbidding any options or
significantly changing their economic
incentives’.
advocates innovation-friendly regulation, suggesting that well-designed
regulation can spur technological advancement by creating
new standards and
requirements where governments should act as catalysts and challengers, not as
controllers.
Friedman advocated

impede innovation and economic

progress, Brownsword and Somsen emphasise the importance
of regulatory

Brownsword discusses
the concept of techno-regulation, where technology itself serves as a regulatory
mechanism. This involves embedding
regulatory techniques within the design of
biomedical technologies to influence behaviour. However, he cautions against
relying solely
on techno-regulation, warning that it can undermine moral and
legal principles by shifting the focus from human agency to technological
control as ‘the techno-regulation approach fails to respect the values of
the moral community or the community of
Brownsword argues
for a nuanced regulatory framework that would promote innovation based on
protecting ethical and social values
and respecting human rights principles
– the so-called ‘bioethical
Since the beginning of the new millennium, the focus has shifted to examining
how new technologies can be utilised as tools for
regulation.
The central idea is
that studying regulation should take priority over merely analysing the law.
This leads to the essential question
of how much technology influences
regulation. According to Lessig, regulation is a comprehensive term encompassing
a wide range of
actions that precede the formalisation of certain behaviours
into legal norms. Thus, regulation becomes the framework for behaviour,
law being just one part of

Jasanoff challenges the
notion of technological determinism, which assumes that technology independently

and cultural values. She argues that this view
overlooks the complex interactions between technology and society, where
values and norms influence technological development. She calls for a
more nuanced understanding of the co-evolution of technology
and society, where
regulation plays a critical role in mediating this
relationship.

for ‘technologies of humility’

Unlike static, one-size-fits-all regulatory models, adaptive

fast-evolving sectors such as technology, climate policy or finance. Some of the
key characteristics are iterative policy-making,

indicating a
departure from pure market logic and recognition of ethical dimensions –
resonating with Brownsword’s ‘bioethical
triangle’ approach.
If the harmonisation of rules in human materials is based on the risk-regulation
system and consumer safety,
then market rationale in regulation prevails. Yet,
as Yeung notes in her analysis of design-based regulation, this can pose
to fundamental rights such as bodily integrity and autonomy,
requiring careful ethical evaluation.
It is clear that the European Union does not have exclusive constitutional
competence to regulate areas such as technology and health,
but it still does
so. How? Two fundamental principles of EU law allow the European Union to
exercise competencies: the principle
of proportionality and the principle of
subsidiarity. Additionally, the harmonisation process rests in Article 114 of
on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which authorises the
approximation of laws to ensure internal market
functioning.
Moreover, Article 168 of the TFEU ensures high human health protection. The
Charter of Fundamental Rights (the Charter) includes provisions
relevant to

in regulation.
Another example is Regulation 2024/1938, which sets standards for the quality

Like the ATMP
Regulation, it integrates precaution, innovation, ethical principles,
harmonisation, transparency and adaptability.
While earlier directives
(Directives 2002/98/EC and 2004/23/EC) had harmonised regulation to a degree,
divergences remained. This
regulation aims to close those gaps, echoing Bennett
Moses’ concern over regulatory lag. It balances precaution and innovation
by establishing high safety standards while supporting structured clinical
outcome monitoring, reflecting Beck’s concern with
emergent risk and
Yeung’s emphasis on real-time evidence.
The EU SoHO platform fosters transparency and
coordination
while national
authorities retain the flexibility to address local needs, supporting
Mourby’s adaptive governance framework.
Ethical considerations and public
involvement are central, including voluntary, unpaid donations and public
awareness campaigns,
aligning with Brownsword’s moral agency and
Jasanoff’s participatory ideals.
While establishing centralised
oversight through national competent authorities and an EU-wide SoHO
Coordination Board, the regulation
also accommodates local
implementation.
This hybrid
model reflects the adaptive, inclusive approach advocated by many scholars and
addresses the challenges of governing
bioprinting and similar biomedical
innovations in a fragmented legal environment.
It is clear that, over the last couple of decades, the European Union has
developed a comprehensive framework for regulating technologies.
That framework
adopts a precautionary and risk-based regulatory approach to harmonising the
market. Its legal framework emphasises
safety, ethical responsibility,
transparency and support for innovation. However, it is only slowly and
selectively moving towards
a more adaptive regulatory approach. While the
European Union has traditionally favoured a precautionary and rule-based
style, there are signs of movement toward adaptive regulatory
practices, particularly in high-tech and biomedical sectors. Still,
is gradual, sector-specific and often tempered by institutional conservatism and
political complexity.
4. Legal Perspectives on Bioprinting and Biosthetics
The European Union maintains a dual-track regulatory ecosystem for biomedical
technologies, one that governs upstream R&D activities
and innovation, and
regulates downstream deployment in healthcare settings for patient care. Each
phase involves distinct authorities,
compliance pathways and legal instruments
– but with increasing emphasis on translational integration, where data
management flow between the two. Each phase also follows separate
compliance pathways – for instance, clinical trials are governed
Clinical Trials Regulation (EU 536/2014), while the deployment of approved
medical technologies in hospitals falls under Medical
Device Regulation (MDR
2017/745) or In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR 2017/746). These frameworks
come with their own legal instruments,
including approval procedures, safety
documentation, ethical guidelines and post-market monitoring rules.
Translational integration
refers to the bridging of these phases, ensuring that
insights, data and risk assessments generated during R&D are carried forward
into the patient care phase and vice versa. This integration allows for more
responsive, evidence-informed regulation, where post-market
surveillance data
(e.g. real-world patient outcomes) can be fed back into future R&D and
policy design.
Finally, data and
risk management flow between the two, highlights the increasingly continuous
nature of regulatory oversight: rather
than seeing R&D and patient care as
isolated, modern EU frameworks aim to connect them through shared health data
systems (such
as EHDS), real-world evidence and iterative regulatory evaluations
that adapt over time. This flow promotes a safer, more efficient
innovation-friendly biomedical ecosystem.
The legal framework governing bioprinting in the European Union is
multifaceted, intersecting with both biomedical R&D and clinical
regulation. Due to their hybrid nature – being part biological and part
synthetic – bioprinted products challenge
conventional regulatory
categories. These products, which this article terms biosthetics, require
particular legal attention because
they blur the lines between tissue-engineered
medicinal products, medical devices and human biological materials. Their
classification
and regulatory pathway therefore depend not only on function and
risk, but also on how law conceptualises their ontological status.
Bioprinted products containing human cells and tissues fall under the SoHO
Regulation (EU 2024/1938), which ensures standards for
safety, ethical
sourcing and quality. This regulation sits at the intersection of clinical care
and biomedical innovation, and directly
applies to bioprinted constructs
intended for therapeutic use. Where bioprinted constructs exhibit biological
activity – such
as regenerating or replacing tissues – they may be
classified as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) under Regulation
No 1394/2007. This designation requires centralised authorisation through the
EMA, bringing strict oversight regarding clinical
evaluation, risk assessment
and long-term monitoring.
Conversely, when the primary function of a bioprinted construct is structural
or mechanical, such as a scaffold with limited biological
it may fall under the
Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The key legal determinant here is the
product’s principal mode
This creates ambiguity
for many bioprinted constructs that combine both mechanical support and
biological integration – again
underscoring their biosthetic identity. In
these cases, regulators must determine on a case-by-case basis whether medicinal
device or combination product rules apply.
In the research and development context, Directive 2001/83/EC lays the
foundation for medicinal product regulation, and its provisions
on manufacturing
practices, marketing authorisation and pharmacovigilance are directly relevant
to bioprinted tissues used as therapeutic
interventions. Directive 2004/23/EC
further provides requirements for the handling and use of human tissues and
cells, ensuring traceability
and safety from donation through application.
Together, these legal instruments establish core principles for regulating the
of bioprinted constructs.
Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 provides a framework for conducting clinical
trials in the European Union, ensuring the safety and rights
of participants.
Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials include Good Clinical Practice
(GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practice
(GMP). The regulation mandates centralised
trial registration, ethics committee approval, informed consent and continuous
monitoring.
Its applicability to bioprinting becomes particularly significant
when human-derived cells – especially pluripotent stem cells
involved. Ethics approvals must address not only the provenance of biological
material, but also the long-term risks
and uncertainties specific to biosthetic
constructs.
GCP demands informed
consent and data integrity,
while GMP enforces stringent controls on production processes, including
documentation and traceability – elements that are
particularly critical
for bioprinting, where each construct may be personalised and produced in small
batches. This presents challenges
for applying mass-production standards to
individualised therapeutic
Furthermore, the integration of digital data in bioprinting adds a regulatory
layer. The creation of bioprinted constructs relies
on numerous data types. By
analysing the bioprinting process and technology, it is possible to extrapolate
the following data: imaging,
genomic, histological, biomaterial, physiological,
anatomical, disease-specific and clinical. These data must be handled according
to Article 35 of the GDPR, which safeguards personal and health-related
information. Especially when creating personalised biosthetics
constructs, AI

invoke future obligations under the AI

Regulation (EU) 2021/2282 on Health
Technology Assessment (HTA) is also increasingly relevant, particularly for
evaluating cost-effectiveness
and integrating bioprinted therapies into public
health systems.
5. Conclusion: Rethinking Regulation in the Age of Biosthetics
The analysis presented in this article underscores the pressing need for a
reorientation of regulatory frameworks in response to the
ontological and
practical complexities introduced by bioprinting technologies. As the European
Union continues to rely on codified
regulatory instruments – such as the
MDR, the GDPR and ATMP Regulation – it becomes increasingly evident that
these instruments,
while comprehensive and grounded in principles of risk
mitigation, patient safety and ethical oversight, lack the flexibility necessary
to respond effectively to fast-paced technological innovation.
This rigidity is not without cause. As discussed in the broader scholarly
discourse, the EU regulatory model is shaped by foundational
principles (proportionality, subsidiarity and legal certainty), bureaucratic
complexity and a precautionary ethos rooted in
diverse ethical cultures across
member states. These characteristics contribute to a structurally conservative
regulatory environment
that excels in stability and coherence, yet often
struggles with anticipatory governance and rapid responsiveness. Scholars such
as Brownsword, Somsen and Jasanoff have highlighted the need for regulatory
systems to evolve alongside the technologies they govern,
advocating for
reflexive, participatory and rights-driven regulatory approaches.
Bioprinted products – here defined as biosthetics – epitomise the
epistemic and material hybridity that challenges existing
legal definitions.
These constructs simultaneously embody characteristics of biological living
matter and synthetically engineered
materials, thereby destabilising traditional
regulatory binaries such as natural/artificial, medicinal product/device and
product/process.
The European Union’s reliance on the ‘principal
mode of action’ test as a primary classifier is illustrative of
limitations of applying categorical logic to technologies that are inherently
integrative and hybrid.
In light of these dynamics, three regulatory pathways for bioprinting within
the European Union can be envisaged. The first, a continuity
model, retains the
current fragmented system where legal classification hinges on functional
assessments – most notably the
principal mode of action. While this
strategy preserves institutional stability, it risks inconsistent regulatory
outcomes and imposes
interpretive burdens on national authorities. The second
pathway proposes targeted reforms to existing legal instruments, such as
amending the MDR, ATMP Regulation and SoHO Regulation, to explicitly incorporate
bioprinting and delineate clearer guidance. However,
this option faces practical
constraints due to the European Union’s procedural complexity and the need
for consensus across
27 member states.
The third and most forward-looking trajectory involves constructing a
dedicated regulatory framework for bioprinting and similar hybrid
technologies. This novel architecture would draw upon the principles of adaptive
governance, incorporating dynamic risk
assessment, stakeholder co-governance and
real-world evidence into regulatory design. Such a framework would recognise the
biosthetics
ontology of 3D bioprinting technologies and respond accordingly with
modular, flexible and ethically embedded legal instruments.
It would also enable
the use of regulatory sandboxes, early scientific advice and conditional
approval mechanisms, thereby aligning
more closely with the innovation
Ultimately, the governance of bioprinting in the European Union demands more
than technical classification; it requires a conceptual
shift. The law must
become a co-productive partner in innovation, capable of evolving with
scientific advances, mediating between
market dynamics and ethical imperatives,
and supporting the translation of biotechnological potential into socially
legitimate outcomes.
The concept of biosthetics introduced in this article not
only captures the ontological novelty of bioprinting but also signals the
for a jurisprudence that embraces hybridity, uncertainty and the co-construction
of regulatory meaning. Such a shift will be
essential if the European Union aims
to maintain its leadership in biomedical innovation while safeguarding
fundamental rights, democratic
values and public trust.
