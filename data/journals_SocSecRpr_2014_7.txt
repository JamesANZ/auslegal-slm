Evidence and discussion
Age pension debt: whether debt should be waived due to administrative
error; whether payments received in 'good faith'
SAKOUTIS and SECRETARY to the DSS
Decided: 13th December 2013 by D. Letcher
Sakoutis was born in Greece and had limited schooling while young. He
migrated to Australia and worked mainly in labouring jobs and
had no further
formal education. When approaching 65 he was unemployed and on newstart
allowance. His wife was working at a nursing
earnings to Centrelink on a fortnightly basis.
On 22 September 2006, when Sakoutis turned 65, Centrelink transferred him to
age pension. Sakoutis completed and submitted a ‘Transfer
to age pension-
Income and Asset Review’ form. On that review form he correctly declared
his wife’s annual earnings as
$30,000. The Centrelink officer performing
the transfer from newstart allowance to age pension made an error and coded his
annual earnings as ‘$0’. His wife’s earnings were
therefore not taken into account to determine his rate of age
pension and he was
paid at the maximum rate.
Centrelink wrote to Sakoutis on 6 and 20 September 2006. Both letters
contained the phrase ‘Combined Annual Income= $5.40’.
sent further letters on 20 April 2007 and 17 April 2008.
Sakoutis continued to receive the maximum rate of age pension until 6 August
2009, when Centrelink informed him that ‘data-matching’
Australian Tax Office (ATO) indicated that its records did not match the
ATO’s records of his wife’s income.
On 8 June 2010 Sakoutis was
advised in writing that he had been overpaid age pension for the period 22
September 2006 to 6 August
2009. The overpayment amounted to $14,181.26.
Sakoutis sought a review of this decision. The SSAT affirmed Centrelink’s
to raise and recover the entire debt.
Legislation
Social Security Act 1991
(the Act) overpayments
are deemed to be debts due to the Commonwealth.
Section 1237A
allows waiver of a debt in the following circumstances. That
section relevantly states:
1237A Waiver of debt arising from error Administrative error
(1) Subject to subsection (1A), the Secretary must waive the right to recover
the proportion of a debt that is attributable solely
to an administrative error
made by the Commonwealth if the debtor received in good faith the payment or
payments that gave rise to
that proportion of the debt.
Note: Subsection (1) does not allow waiver of a part of a debt that was
caused partly by administrative error and partly by one or
more other factors
(such as error by the debtor).
Evidence and discussion
Sakoutis gave evidence that when he received the 6 and 20 September 2006
letters he noticed the reference to ‘Combined Annual
Income- $5.40’.
He stated that he thought that the $5.40 could possibly refer to bank interest,
but his bank told him this
was not the case. He explained he then thought no
more of it. Sakoutis also gave evidence that Centrelink had not contacted him
in relation to his income, but conceded that there may have been letters
sent to him that he did not recall.
Sakoutis gave evidence that he understood that his wife’s income would
have some effect on his pension, but that he thought
that the rules for age
pension were different to the rules for newstart allowance.
Centrelink produced ‘archive copies’ of the letters sent to
Sakoutis on 6 and 20 September 2006, 20 April 2007 and 17
April 2008. The
Tribunal described these ‘archive copies’:
These “archive copies” were taken from computer records and it
was fairly said were not in the same format as the letters
actually sent.
Indeed, the archive letters were almost impossible for me to decipher although
the figures $5.40 and $6.30 could be
discerned in a maelstrom of symbols and
punctuation marks. [para.10]
Based on the material before it, the Tribunal concluded that the letters
dated 20 September 2006 and 20 April 2007 did not state clearly
that if his
partner earns wages, Sakoutis must inform of any changes, or that if he did so,
then the amount of age pension he received
might be reduced. In relation to the
figures $5.40 (and later $6.30) noted as ‘income’ on his Centrelink
letters, the
Tribunal accepted that the figures bore no relationship to the
reality of Mr and Mrs Sakoutis’ income. The Tribunal accepted
Sakoutis was puzzled by the amount, but believed it to be an ‘irrelevant
mistake’ [para 16]. As a result of this
the Tribunal accepted that
Sakoutis commenced receiving age pension in good faith.
The Tribunal further found that the payment of the maximum rate of age
pension to Sakoutis from 20 September 2006 arose solely from
Centrelink’s
administrative error and not through any fault of Sakoutis. The Tribunal
Taking into account Mr Sakoutis’ limited education, limited ability to
read complex English and his age I believe it is unreasonable
to expect him to
have been alerted to the fact that the information he provided to Centrelink
both in the Transfer form and personally
the day before his Age Pension
commenced was not processed by the Age Pension clerk because of a mistake. The
Age Pension is provided
to many people with limited education, lim-ited English
and necessarily of advancing years, Centrelink letters should be clear and
simple. These were not. The respondent’s Statement of Facts and
Contentions... asserts that Mr Sakoutis “contributed
to the debt” by
not responding to the September 2006 Centrelink correspondence stating a
com-bined annual income of $5.40.
I disagree. That figure is so small that it is
obviously nothing to do with any likely actual com-bined annual income...
The Tribunal then examined the letter dated 20 April 2007. This letter listed
the things Sakoutis had to tell Centrelink about. The
list included:
If your income changes..... that is if:
- Your combined income, not including financial investments or maintenance
- You or your partner start work or go back to work
- You or your partner start any form of profession, trade business of
self-employment.
The Tribunal found that the word ‘combined’ in this sentence did
not clearly set out that it referred to the combined
income of Sakoutis and his
wife. It could have referred to combined sources of personal income instead. The
remaining requirements
were plainly not applicable to Sakoutis, as he and his
wife did not start work, return to work or start a profession or business
that time. As a result the Tribunal found that Sakoutis did not contribute to
the debt as a result of not complying with any
obligation set out in the April
2007 letter.
The Tribunal distinguished these letters from the letter dated 17 April 2008.
The Tribunal found that the 2008 letter was in a very
different form to the
previous letters and clearly stated that Sakoutis was to inform Centrelink if
his partner’s income changed,
including if it ‘goes up or
down’. The letter also clearly explained that changes to income would
affect his rate of
pension, possibly resulting in a debt.
The Tribunal referred to evidence given by Sakoutis that he understood that
his wife’s wages would affect his rate of pension,
and that her wages did
indeed change, even if only by $55 per fortnight. The Tribunal also took into
account the fact the much clearer
statements in the 18 April 2008 letter in
relation to Sakoutis’ obligations to report changes to his partner’s
The Tribunal found that after the receipt of the April 2008 letter the
debt ceased to be attributed solely to administrative error
made by the
Commonwealth within the meaning of
However, up until the 17 April 2008
letter Sakoutis had received all payments in good faith and the debt was found
to be solely attributed
to the Commonwealth’s administrative errors.
The Tribunal was not satisfied that there were other reasons to waive
recovery of the remaining portion of the debt.
The Tribunal set aside the decision under review and substituted for it the
decision that:
1. The proportion of the claimed debt referable to the period 18 April 2008
to 6 August 2009 was a debt due to the Commonwealth; and
2. Recovery of the proportion of the claimed debt relating to the period 22
September 2006 to 17 April 2008 was waived pursuant to
of the Act.
