The Australian Law Reform Commission
The Australian Law Reform Commission’s final report on privacy law and
For Your Information: Australian privacy law and practice
(report no. 108), was delivered to the Commonwealth Attorney-General on 30
May 2008 and was launched by the then Cabinet Secretary,
Senator John Faulkner,
and the Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland MP, on
11 August 2008. The report recommends 295 changes designed to improve
Australia’s privacy framework. Central to these changes
are a unified set
of Privacy Principles for the public and private sectors, national consistency
in privacy law at all levels of
government, and keeping the Privacy Act
technologically neutral to ensure its continued relevance.
The Government said it intended to respond to the report in two stages.
On 14 October 2009 it released the first stage of its response, which
outlined its position in relation to 197 recommendations relating
• developing a single set of Privacy Principles
• redrafting and updating the structure of the Privacy Act
• responding to the impact of new technologies on privacy
• strengthening and clarifying the Privacy Commissioner’s powers and
• introducing comprehensive credit reporting and better protections for
credit reporting information
• improving and clarifying the protections associated with the sharing of
health information and the ability to use personal
information to facilitate
research in the public interest.
The Government has announced
that it plans to release an exposure draft implementing the first-stage response
in early 2010.

Royal Commissions Act
On 6 April 2009 the Australian Law Reform Commission released
the Royal Commissions Act
(issues paper no. 35). The commission had
been asked by the Attorney‑General to review the operation of the
Commissions Act 1902
(Cth), including whether royal commissions have
sufficient powers to operate effectively, whether there are suitable protections
for the rights of people who participate in a royal commission, and whether
there is a need to establish other forms of inquiry that
are less formal and
more cost-effective.
On 18 August 2009 the commission released discussion paper no. 75,
Royal Commissions and Official Inquiries
, which contained 75 proposals.
The final report,
Making Inquiries: a new statutory framework
no. 111), was tabled in parliament on 4 February 2010. The report contains
82 recommendations, including that the
Royal Commissions Act
be amended and
renamed the
Inquiries Act
in order to provide for the establishment of two tiers
of public inquiry (royal commissions and official inquiries), that royal
commissions
be the highest form of inquiry established by the Governor-General
to look into matters of substantial public importance, and that
inquiries be established by a minister to look into matters of public
importance. Further details are available at

and confidentiality
On 5 August 2008 the Attorney-General issued to the Australian Law Reform
Commission terms of reference for reviewing secrecy and
confidentiality
provisions in federal legislation. The commission was to ensure that whatever
options it developed were ‘balanced
against the need to maintain an open
and accountable government through providing appropriate access to
information’. An issues
Review of Secrecy Law
, was released
in February 2009 and a discussion paper in June 2009.
The final report,
Secrecy Laws and Open Government in Australia
(report no. 112), was tabled in parliament on 11 March 2010. The principles
underpinning the ALRC’s recommendations are as follows:
• Administrative and disciplinary frameworks play the central role in
ensuring that government information is handled appropriately
and that every
person in the information chain understands their responsibilities in respect of
that information.
• Criminal sanctions should be imposed only where they are
warranted—when the disclosure of government information is
likely to cause
harm to essential public interests—and where this is not the case the
unauthorised disclosure of information
is more appropriately dealt with by the
imposition of administrative penalties or the pursuit of contractual
• There is a continuing role for properly framed secrecy
offences—both general and specific—in protecting Commonwealth
information, provided that they are clear and consistent and directed at
protecting essential public interests.
