REASONS FOR DECISION
(Delivered 31 March 2023)
JUDGE MACDONALD
Applicant served a Police Domestic Violence Order (PDVO) on Mr PJP (the
Defendant) on 11 June 2019, following a serious incident
at a residence where he
and Ms LN (Protected Person), together with three named children of the
relationship, lived. That incident
involved the Defendant seriously assaulting
the Protected Person with an edged weapon. An interim DVO under the
and Family Violence Act 2007
(the Act) was made on 10 June 2019 in terms of
Exhibit 1, naming the Protected Person and the three children.
9 July 2020, the Defendant was sentenced to five years and six months
imprisonment for his offending against the Protected Person,
backdated to 9 June
2019, such that the sentence expires on 8 December 2024. A non-parole period of
two years ten months was fixed,
and any parole would involve protective
conditions.
Applicant seeks a Court DVO (CDVO) for a period of ten years, so to October
2030. The Defendant would consent to a CDVO in the
current terms and conditions,
and seeks an order of one year from the date of latest release, being 8 December
2024, so to December
interim DVO made 21 August 2020 is essentially in full non-contact terms, with
safe exceptions provided for contact, particularly
particularly relevant sections of the Act are
. The Act does
not provide any inner or outer limit in relation to the duration of any DVO,
however s 21(1) circumscribes restraints
prescribed by any DVO on the concept of
necessary or desirable
” for the prevention of domestic
violence against a protected person. Other criteria are also expressly relevant,
the concept of ‘encouraging the Defendant to change his
behaviour’, and a further consideration of “
” in relation to other orders.
may also be generally accepted that the terms of any order a court is empowered
to make, casting a compliance obligation or coercive
effect on a subject, must
be relevant and reasonably proportionate to the circumstances of the situation
to which the order is directed.
Analogous situations are the terms on which
offenders are conditionally released on bonds, suspended sentences, or parole.
evidence included a statutory declaration of Senior Constable Tony Schaefe-Lee
declared 15 September 2020 and the Defendant’s
Information for Courts. The
Defendant has three prior convictions for contravening a DVO and five prior
convictions for offences
of violence. It is very relevant that the offence for
which the Defendant was convicted on 9 July 2020 was particularly serious,
involved at least three stab wounds to the Protected Person, and that it was not
his first assault on the Protected Person.
features of the offending put to the Court by paragraph 12 of the
Applicant’s submissions are accepted. The Defendant’s
submissions
rely heavily on the phrases set out above from section 21, and refer to
legislated schemes in other jurisdictions concerning
domestic violence, and
highlight the term “
” from the phrase “
”. The Defendant submits that a ten-year order would
ostensibly abrogate the rights of the Defendant to actively
participate as a father in the children’s lives
” and that such a
lengthy order “
is so oppressive and unjust that it is likely to crush
the spirit of the Defendant such that he is not encouraged to change his
is accepted that the focus of the terms “
” is predominantly in respect of the Defendant. However,
the nature of the adverse and violent features of the relationship
between the
Defendant and the adult Protected Person (and the child Protected Persons) and
what is both reasonable and just in the
Protected Persons’ circumstances
having regard to the relationships to date, are to be included in applying the
guides. I also consider what analogous schemes in other
orders, provide is not to the point.
all the circumstances, including due to the extended period the Defendant is to
spend in custody (during which time the DVO is
of more limited effect) I
consider a period of ten years from the date of the Interim DVO to be within the
bounds of both “
Clearly, a DVO in favour of the Protected Persons is generally
“desirable”.
(i) A Court DVO is made in the same terms of the Proposed Form of Orders, until
20 August 2030.
(ii) NT Police are to serve the DVO on the Defendant.
Including compliance with any
DVO in place.
Exhibit 1. A
Proposed Form of Orders was also provided to the Court, which are in
substantially the same terms.
