AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COMMISSION
Workplace Relations Act 1996
—Procedure for carrying out award modernisation process
Request from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—28 March 2008
Award Modernisation
(AM2008/25)
JUSTICE GIUDICE, PRESIDENT
MELBOURNE, 27 NOVEMBER 2009
On 4 September 2009 the Commission made the
Aircraft Cabin Crew Award 2010
Airline Operations – Ground Staff Award 2010
On 9 November 2009 the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (the Minister) varied the award modernisation request of 28
March 2008 pursuant to
Workplace Relations Act 1996
The variation inserted three additional paragraphs in the request. The additional paragraphs concern the process of award modernisation
in the airline industry. They are particularly relevant to the two awards mentioned above.
This morning there was a hearing before me at which interested parties put forward proposals as to what should now be done.
There will be discussions in the week commencing 30 November 2009 between the Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and
Services Union, the Flight Attendants’ Association of Australia (Domestic/Regional Division) and the Flight Attendants’
Association of Australia (International Division) on the one hand and airline employers on the other about any proposals for changes
in the awards taking into account the variation in the Minister’s request. Those discussions should lead to a clear understanding
of positions on all sides and narrow the areas of disagreement. Thereafter the following arrangements will apply:
(a) any application to vary the
Aircraft Cabin Crew Award 2010
Airline Operations – Ground Staff Award 2010
pursuant to
based on the variation made to the Minister’s award modernisation request on 9 November 2009 must be filed with full grounds
in support by 4 December 2009;
(b) any submissions and proposals in response must be filed by 11 December 2009;
(c) the Commission will sit on 16 December 2009 to hear any final submissions.
Any application for variation under
will be referred to a Full Bench. Any interested party has liberty to make application for a further directions hearing at short
