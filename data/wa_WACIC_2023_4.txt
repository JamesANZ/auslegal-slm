F HOLYOAK-ROBERTS
Reasons for Decision
Watson (the applicant) who was born on 27 October 1981 made an application on 29
January 2023 for compensation for injuries
suffered as a consequence of an
offence which occurred on 22 June 2022 at Madora Bay (the offence).
On 5 May 2023 I awarded the
applicant $500 compensation for injuries suffered as
a consequence of the offence. By email dated 8 May 2023 the applicant requested
my reasons for decision which are set out below.
application was made pursuant to
Criminal Injuries
Compensation Act 2003
(the Act) which authorises an Assessor to award an
applicant compensation if satisfied the claimed injury and any claimed loss
as a consequence of the commission of a proved offence which is defined
in section 3 of the Act. Angelina Tania Johnson (the offender)
entered a plea
of guilty to the charge of assault public officer at the Mandurah Magistrates
Court on the 22 July 2022 in relation
to the offence. As such I was
satisfied a proved offence as defined in the Act was constituted.
circumstances of the incident are outlined in the incident report as follows:
On Wednesday the 29th of June 2022 at about 10:20pm we were tasked to an address
in Madora Bay for a recovery order for a child.
During the recovery order Monique JOHNSON (mother of the child) and Angelina
JOHNSON (Moniques mother) became highly agitated and
attempted to prevent the
recovery. Angelina grabbed the child whilst in S/C WATSONS arms and began
clawing at S/CWATSONs face leaving
7x scratches on the right side of the face,
resulting in bleeding.
Monique and Angelina had to be restrained using empty hand tactics to provent
) them both from continuing to attack S/C WATSON.
The child was removed and taken from the address unharmed.
support of his application the applicant provided a statement of events and
victim impact statement together with fourteen photographs
of his injuries.
Copies of his medical notes were obtained pursuant to section 19 of the Act
from Rockingham Medical Centre where
he attended post incident.
photographs depict scratches to the applicant's face of a superficial nature,
one being deeper and longer than the balance of
the scratches. The applicant
alleged there was scarring left by the scratches but it is difficult to
ascertain any scarring in the
pictures provided.
medical notes obtained pursuant to section 19 of the Act indicate the
applicant first attended his general practitioner on the
5 July 2022
complaining of recent scratches to his face when on duty. He was also worried
Antibiotics were prescribed for the
unrelated infection also in the hope they would cover any risk of infection in
relation to the
scratches the applicant sustained in the incident. He was
reviewed on the 8 July 2022 by telehealth and the unrelated skin infection
together with the scratches were discussed. By 27 July 2022 he was
experiencing no infections related to this incident.
his victim impact statement, the applicant said following the incident he used
alcohol sanitiser to clean the wounds to his face.
He felt disgusted and dirty
and could not sleep at night. He said he was worried over the next few days and
weeks he would acquire
some sort of infection although it was explained to him
he would not require blood tests as his injuries were caused by fingernails
not teeth. He said he suffered disturbed sleep for a number of days and found
himself becoming short tempered. He was mocked
for the injuries to his face by
his colleagues and other criminals (which is non-compensable) and felt
frustrated. I have no evidence
the applicant's psychological symptoms were
long term nor that he sought any treatment for it.
regard to the evidence I was satisfied the applicant suffered physical injury as
a result of the incident. In relation to
any psychological sequelae, to award
compensation for mental and nervous shock pursuant to section 35 of the
Act, I must be satisfied
the symptoms are of an enduring character so as to
amount to an injury in legal sense and common parlance as opposed to a mere
[2018] WADC148). I accept the
applicant experienced psychological symptomology as a consequence of the
incident but on the information
available to me I was not satisfied the
symptomology was of an enduring character. I therefore declined to award
compensation for
the psychological component of the claim.
the evidence available to me the applicant's physical injury resolved by 8 July
2022 although his injury was discussed when he
presented on two subsequent
occasions for an unrelated infection. Therefore, on the information available
to me I assessed the applicant's
injury at $500.
applicant made no claim for any losses and therefore no award was made in
relation to those items.
I certify that the preceding paragraph(s)
comprise the reasons for decision of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Assessor
