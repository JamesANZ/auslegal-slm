DECISION: The Tribunal affirms the decision under review to refuse the grant of
a Prospective Marriage (Temporary) (Class TO)Subclass
300 (Prospective
Marriage) visa to the Visa Applicant.
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
On 15 June 1998 Mr Duy Thinh Nguyen applied to this Tribunal for a review of a
decision made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration
and Multicultural
Affairs (the Minister) at the Australian Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam on 15 March 1997 to refuse
his then stated fiancé, Ms Thi Phuong
Thao, a Prospective Marriage (Class TO) Subclass 300 (Prospective Marriage)
enable her to come to Australia. This decision was affirmed by the
Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO) on 20 April 1998.
Ms Thi Phuong Thao (the Visa Applicant) was born in Vietnam on 25 February 1975
and is a citizen of that country. She currently resides
in Vietnam. She has not
been previously married. Her parents and siblings reside in Vietnam and her
remaining half brother resides
in Australia.
She was sponsored for migration to Australia by Mr Duy Minh Nguyen, an
Australian citizen since 26 January 1991 who signed the relevant
sponsorship
form on 8 April 1995.
On 24 May 1995, the Visa Applicant lodged a completed application Form 47
seeking to come to Australia as the prospective spouse
of an Australian
citizen, Mr Duy Minh Nguyen. She had applied for a Subclass 300
(Prospective Spouse) visa. At the time of the
application the Visa Applicant
was aged 20. Her sponsor Mr Duy Nguyen was aged 28. His father and
sister reside in Australia.
Various documents and material accompanied the application.
Correspondence passed between Mr Nguyen and the Department of Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs (the Department) regarding the
application.
The Visa Applicant was interviewed in Vietnam on 13 November 1996 by an officer
of the Department with the assistance of an interpreter.
A copy of that
interview is on the Department's file.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
On 15 March 1997, a decision was made at the Australian Consulate General in Ho
Chi Minh City to refuse the Visa Applicant's application
for a Subclass 300
(Prospective Spouse) visa. The primary decision maker noted in part that the
Visa Applicant was unable to satisfy
clauses 300.215 and 300.216 of the
Migration Regulations.
The decision maker referred in part to the interview of the Visa Applicant
noting that she had little knowledge of her fiancé
who had spent time
with her at Dalat before their engagement in early 1995.
The decision maker referred to the photographs produced noting that the Visa
Applicant's sponsor was 34 years of age and 14 years
her senior.
The Tribunal notes that Mr Duy Thinh Nguyen was born in 1967 as shown on his
passport and Australian citizenship certificate and
On 9 May 1997 Mr Duy Thinh Nguyen applied to MIRO for a review of the decision
to refuse the Visa Applicant a Subclass 300 visa.
Mr Nguyen indicated in part
that he had returned to Vietnam and married the Visa Applicant on 14 January
"in a traditional service in Vietnam in the presence of all their
family and friends"
although the
"marriage was not registered with
Further material was submitted to MIRO and the Department regarding the
relationship.
The decision to refuse the Visa Applicant's application was affirmed by MIRO on
20 April 1998. In arriving at this decision the
review officer noted in
"I have examined the application, detailed file notes, reasons for the decision
and the claims made in the review application by
the sponsor in light of the
relevant legislation, policy and procedural advice and I find I must affirm the
primary decision to refuse
the grant of the visa. For the same reasons as
noted by the primary decision maker and for the following, I do not consider
the applicant genuinely intends to marry and live together as the spouse
of the sponsor.
The applicant and sponsor were introduced to each other by the sponsor's
uncle. I have some doubts that the relationship is a mature
and committed one
given the applicant's inability to explain how the relationship developed so
quickly. I also note that the applicant's
interview was approximately 18
months after the application was lodged and given her limited knowledge of the
sponsor and of any
future issues of importance, I share the same doubts as the
primary decision maker;
It appears that the applicant and sponsor have no future plans which would
reasonably be expected of a couple committed to and contemplating
The number on which the sponsor is said to contact the applicant is the
sponsor's uncle's telephone number. I cannot be certain that
the calls made
are to the applicant and therefore I give these little weight in the
applicant's favour;
I note that the applicant and sponsor have gone through an extremely
elaborate ceremony in December 1995. However the applicant's
claim that he did
not have time to arrange for a marriage certificate nor register the marriage
is completely at odds with the efforts
of the engagement in which photos
indicate that this would have taken a considerable period of time to arrange.
Given that the applicant
claims to have not had time to get a marriage
certificate, I have some doubts as to the genuineness of the
relationship;
I note that the sponsor arrived back in Australia on 21 January 1996 and
has not returned to Vietnam since. I find it difficult to
accept that he has
not returned to Vietnam if the relationship is a genuine one and there is
insufficient evidence to substantiate
that the relationship is
continuing.
I am not satisfied that at the time of application and at the time of this
decision that the applicant has a commitment to a shared
life with the sponsor.
I agree with the primary decision maker that the applicant's relationship is
not genuine and that the parties
do not have a mutual commitment to sharing
their lives together as "spouses".
The applicant is unable to meet clauses
300.216 and 300.221."

The Tribunal has before it the file of the Department in relation to this
matter and other material submitted directly to the Tribunal.
A hearing of
this matter was held in Sydney on 15 December 1988, at which Mr Duy Thinh
Nguyen gave sworn evidence to the Tribunal.
An interpreter was present to
assist the parties. Mr Nguyen's legal adviser, a registered migration agent,
was also in attendance.
Mr Nguyen referred to his going to Vietnam in December 1994 for a holiday and
to meet someone to marry. He went with his father.
In Vietnam he met some
other girls and his uncle introduced him to the Visa Applicant. She was
"selling things"
at the time. He liked her and with the families
permission, they went out together. An engagement was arranged and they were
engaged. There was a large celebration. He had decided to marry her
after their trip to Dalat.
They decided not to marry at the time as it would take too long and he did not
have enough time a she needed to return to work.
It was decided that his
father would go at another time and arrange the marriage.
Mr Nguyen stated that he returned to Vietnam and married the Visa Applicant on
14 January 1996. They had a wedding reception however
they have not obtained a
marriage certificate from the authorities as he thought it would take too long
and he had to return to Australia
Mr Nguyen stated that he has told all his family and friends (including those
at his place of work) that he and the Visa Applicant
are married. They lived
as husband and wife in Vietnam and while together there, presented as a married
couple. They believe they
are married although they have not obtained a formal
marriage certificate in Vietnam. Mr Nguyen plans to visit his wife in Vietnam
again. Indeed a paid airfare ticket indicating he will go to Vietnam on 18
December 1998 returning to Australia on 22 January 1999
was produced to the
Tribunal. (The Tribunal notes that Mr Nguyen travelled to Vietnam as
indicated).
Reference was made to the Visa Applicant's family in Vietnam and Australia. Mr
Nguyen reiterated that he and the Visa Applicant
are married and they lived as
husband and wife at her place in Vietnam where they presented as a couple.
Mr Nguyen sends money to his wife in Vietnam regularly as reflected in the
material produced to the Tribunal. They are in regular
telephone. He regards himself as married to the Visa Applicant although he had
not obtained a formal marriage
certificate from the authorities in Vietnam.
When he sponsored the Visa Applicant she was his fiancé however they
subsequently
married in Vietnam on 14 January 1996. They have not obtained a
marriage certificate in Vietnam because of the delays and Mr Nguyen
want to lose his job in Australia. He wants his wife to join him in Australia.
Perhaps one of the most fundamental requirements for the Subclass of visa
sought is that the Visa Applicant intends
to marry an Australian citizen
or permanent resident.
The intention of a Subclass 300 (Prospective Marriage) visa is to enable the
holder of such a visa to travel to Australia for the
purpose of marrying an
Australian citizen or permanent resident.
However given the evidence and material before it including the statements of
Mr Nguyen, the photographs, videos and the like produced
in this matter the
Tribunal finds that the Visa Applicant and Mr Nguyen are married and have lived
together as husband and wife.
The Tribunal notes that the Visa Applicant and Mr Duy Thinh Nguyen were
lawfully married in Vietnam on 14 January 1996. A copy marriage
certificate
has not been produced. Consequently the Visa Applicant is unable to satisfy
regulation 300.221 given that she is married.
In all the circumstances the Tribunal concludes on balance that the Visa
Applicant is unable to satisfy clause 300.221 of the Regulations
entitled to the visa sought (see also
IRT Decision 5329, 26 May
IRT Decision 12235 8 July 1998.)
The Tribunal notes on balance that it appears the relationship between the Visa
Applicant and Mr Nguyen is genuine and continuing
and that from the evidence
and material before it that the Visa Applicant satisfies the definition of a
as referred to in regulation 1.15A of the Regulations.
In the circumstances should the Visa Applicant make an application as the
of Mr Nguyen in the future the Department may wish to expedite
such an application in the light of the findings above.
The Tribunal affirms the decision to refuse the grant of a Subclass 300
(Prospective Marriage) visa to the Visa Applicant.

and Reasons for Decision of Steve Karas.
