REASONS FOR THE ORDER OF THE COMMISSIONER OF TENANCIES
INQUIRY - Wednesday, 1 April 2015
DARREN REINTJENS AND SANDRA VAN DER MEULEN
(‘landlord’)
ANNASTACIA WILLIAMS (‘tenant’)
RT1415-0475
This is a determination of an application by the landlord dated 29 January
2015 in respect of premises being 22 Troughton Court, Woodroffe
in the Northern
Territory of Australia (‘the premises’), seeking order(s) under the
Residential Tenancies Act
(NT) (‘the Act’) as follows:
Compensation
pursuant to section 122.
A Notice of Inquiry dated 18 February 2015
was posted to the parties. The Inquiry was conducted on Wednesday, 1 April
following appeared at the Inquiry and made submissions:
Jessica Maxwell and Ms Hayley Hosking of Real Estate Central on behalf of the
There was no appearance at the Inquiry on behalf of the
tenant, however, I am satisfied that she was given notice of the Inquiry as
required by section 130 of the Act.
The evidence before the Inquiry consisted of the following materials:
documents submitted by the landlord in support of the application and kept on
the Commissioner of Tenancies file numbered RT1415-0475;
following additional materials received by me at the Inquiry and marked as such
on the file:
RT08 Notice served on the tenant on 18 December 2014 with associated
attachments;
and Outgoing Condition Reports;
series of emails between Ms Maxwell and the tenant regarding remedial works
highlighted in the Outgoing Condition Report and the
tenant’s approval to
these works;
Status Report dated 1 April 2014; and
of Actions and Claim from Ms Maxwell on behalf of the landlord.
oral evidence of Ms Maxwell and Ms Hosking.
On the basis of the
above evidence I find there is a tenancy agreement between the landlord and the
tenant in respect of the premises
within the meaning of and subject to the
provisions of the Act. The key details of the tenancy agreement are as follows:
Duration: Fixed term commencing 6 February 2014 and ending 4 February
Rent: $ 660.00 per week payable fortnightly in advance
Security Deposit $2,640.00
The tenancy was for a fixed term of 52 weeks, commencing on 6 February 2014.
The tenancy was due to expire on 4 February 2015 and
the tenant gave up vacant
possession of the premises on 16 December 2014. This situation is commonly known
as a “lease break”.
Rent was paid until 17 December 2014.
The premises were leased to new tenants on 30 January 2015.
A security deposit of $2,640.00 was paid by the tenant at the commencement of
the tenancy, as required under the tenancy agreement.
The landlord withheld the
entire security deposit for various purposes as detailed in an RT08 Notice
provided to the Tenant on 18
December 2014 with the tenant subsequently
consenting in writing to the landlord retaining the security deposit to offset a
of costs to rectify items highlighted in the Outgoing Condition Report.
Once these items were deducted the
of the security deposit held
in trust was $84.25.
In passing I note that several of the items claimed perhaps fall outside what
I believe are permitted under the Act however this is
a matter not relevant to
the application under consideration.
The landlord is seeking compensation pursuant to section 122 totalling
as follows:
Loss of rent the
tenant would have been liable to pay for the period 18 December 2014 until 29
January 2015 - $3,970.05 (after the
$84.25 balance of the security deposit held
in Trust is taken in to account and netted off); and
Unpaid excess
water charges - $318.05
At the Inquiry the landlord’s agents
provided both documentary and oral evidence of the attempt made to mitigate
loss. The property
was advertised on web portals realestate.com.au; real estate
central; domain; sales and rentals and rentfind.com.au. In addition
open houses
were conducted on 19 and 23 December 2014 and 5, 12, 16, 20 and 24 January 2015.
The tenant also showed the property
to prospective tenants sourced via an
advertisement placed on Gumtree. On 12 January 2015 the landlord made the
decision to lower
the advertised rental rate from $660.00 per week to $630.00
per week. This resulted in the property being relet at the new rate on
January 2015.
Compensation for Lost Rent ($4,054.28)
According to the Rent Ledger provided at the Inquiry rent was paid up to 17
December 2014 by the tenant. The property was vacated
on 16 December 2014 and
relet on 30 January 2015.
I am satisfied that the landlords have taken genuine and sufficient steps to
mitigate against their loss and are therefore entitled
to claim compensation for
loss of rent. The claim is allowed.
The landlord is entitled to compensation for “lost rent” for the
period 18 December 2014 to 29 January 2015 (ie 43 days).
Weekly Rent - $660.00
Daily Rent - $94.2857 per day
Number of Days – 43
Amount Claimed - $94.2857 x 43 = $4,054.28
Compensation for Unpaid Excess Water Charges ($318.05)
The landlord sought to rely upon an excess water clause in the tenancy
agreement as the basis for this claim. However during the course
of the Inquiry
it was conceded by Ms Hosking that the tenancy agreement (a standard form REINT
residential tenancy agreement) signed
by the parties omitted page 4 (of 9). This
page contained the excess water clause. As the tenancy agreement has been
executed without
this page, the agreement makes no provision for the recovery of
excess water charges from the tenant.
The landlord therefore has no legal basis upon which to make this claim. The
landlord is therefore
not entitled
to receive compensation for unpaid
excess water charges.
Accordingly, I order that:
tenant is liable to pay to the landlord compensation pursuant to section 122 of
the Act in the total amount of $4,054.28 being
for Lost Rent; and
the basis of the order for compensation made in Order 1 above, the landlord is
entitled retain the balance of the security deposit
held in Trust of $84.25 in
satisfaction of compensation awarded in Order 1.
Dated this 2 April 2015

Commissioner of Tenancies
