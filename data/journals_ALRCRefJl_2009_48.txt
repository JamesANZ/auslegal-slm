The Jihad Seminar
By Hanifa Deen Reviewed by Bruce Alston
In March 2002, an evangelical Christian group, Catch the Fire Ministries,
held a seminar entitled ‘Insight into Islam’.
While the title might
sound like an invitation to inter-faith understanding, the seminar became the
subject of prolonged litigation
under newly enacted Victorian anti-vilifi cation
legislation after opinions were expressed about Muslim beliefs and conduct,
that Muslims are violent, terrorists, demonic, seditious, untruthful,
misogynistic, paedophilic, anti-democratic, anti-Christian
and intent on taking
over Australia.
The Islamic Council of Victoria took a complaint to the Victorian Civil and
Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) claiming that the organisers
of the seminar had
Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001
RRTA). The RRTA states that a person must not ‘on the ground of the
religious belief or activity of another person
or class of persons engage in
conduct that incites hatred against, serious contempt for, or revulsion or
severe ridicule of, that
other person or class of persons’.
This book by Hanifa Deen provides an informed and entertaining account of the
background to the legal wrangling. By examining the
motivations and
understandings of those engaged in the dispute, her account paints a much fuller
picture of what the parties thought
was at stake than can be obtained simply by
reading the legal material.
Briefly, in 2003, VCAT (Higgins J) found the Islamic Council’s
complaint to be substantiated and that statutory exemptions for
conduct engaged
in ‘reasonably and in good faith’ were unavailable in the
circumstances. In reaching this latter conclusion,
VCAT found that the
‘unbalanced’ presentation of the seminar evidenced an absence of
good faith, whether viewed subjectively
or objectively.
The fact-finding process in VCAT involved evidence from religious experts as
to the accuracy of a Christian pastor’s statements
concerning Muslim
religious beliefs. Matters traversed included the meaning of the term
‘jihad’, practices in Muslim
conversion, the legal framework in
Shari’a law for the treatment of non-Muslims, the prevalence of extremist
views within Islam,
and the role of holy texts and their interpretation in
understanding religions generally.
In a 2005 determination on remedies, Higgins J ordered that the respondents,
Catch the Fire Ministries, publish a series of prominent
advertisements
reporting that they had breached the RRTA and admitting that the seminar was
‘essentially hostile, demeaning
and derogatory’ of Muslims, Allah
and the Prophet Muhammad.
The respondents were required to provide
undertakings to desist from making such statements in future.
For the outside observer, legal fact-fi nding about religious beliefs may
verge on the nonsensical—an argument about the nature
of respective
‘invisible friends’. Whatever view you take of religion, however,
the case raised important issues concerning
the desirability and effectiveness
of religious anti-vilifi cation laws. At present, only Tasmanian, Queensland and
Victorian legislation
makes religious vilifi cation unlawful.
Rights Australia has in two separate reports in 1998 and 2004, recommended the
introduction of a federal law rendering vilifi
cation on the ground of religion
or belief unlawful.
In this case, the respondents appealed. In 2006, the Victorian Court of
Appeal upheld the appeal and ordered that the case be reheard
in the VCAT. The
Court found that VCAT had decided that the seminar contravened
of the RRTA
because Higgins J was satisfi ed that the speaker was moved or caused by the
religious beliefs of Muslims to make the
statements which he did at the seminar,
and that an ordinary reasonable person would be inclined by the statements to
hate Muslims.
The Court of Appeal considered that this was not the question
which needed to be decided. Rather, the question was whether, having
the content of the statements and to the nature of the audience, the natural and
ordinary effect of what was stated was
to encourage the hatred of Muslims based
on their religious beliefs.
Many people, especially those unfamiliar with the refi ned art of judicial
statutory interpretation, would fi nd distinctions such
as these rather
incomprehensible. Perhaps the law had its revenge on religion by displaying its
own ability to count angels on the
head of pin?
Following the appeal, after attempting conciliation and exhausted by their
legal and theological sparring, the parties fi nally settled
in a confi dential
out-of-court settlement, bringing the legal marathon to a close. Deen notes that
the case, originally expected
to be over in three days, took almost six years
before petering out with the key question still unanswered: was the conduct
of vilifi cation under the RRTA? In the end ‘the wisest course
for both sides was to publicly accept a draw and return home
to tell their
supporters they had won’.
It is problematic to limit free speech in relation to beliefs except by
reference to actual urging of force or violence—rather
than incitement of
contempt, ridicule or even hatred. Laws such as the RRTA, from this perspective,
come uncomfortably close to establishing
redress for ‘defamation of
religion’ as a human rights violation. Such an approach was supported by a
November 2008 (non-binding)
resolution of the United Nations Human Rights
Council, which many fear could be used to justify restrictions on freedom of
in Muslim countries.
The importance of Deen’s account is to place the dispute in its full
cultural context and to explain something about the motivations
personalities involved. She is open about her own standpoint—after hearing
accounts of the seminar she was in no doubt
that Australian Muslims had been
vilifi ed in her understanding of the term. On the other hand, she says,
‘was it really worth
getting worked up about?’ Should anyone really
care about what ill-informed fundamentalist Christians might say about
contemporary
Islam? The Islamic Council certainly did, and were entitled to seek
redress through the law—but may not have anticipated the
unpredictable
legal and media reactions.
