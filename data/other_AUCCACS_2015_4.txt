The Offending Conduct
The trial dealt with six charges, four of which the offender/applicant
physically threatened victims with weapons he possessed at
the time of each
crime (constituting an aggravating factor in these cases). [116]
The first was a ‘very serious’ juvenile offence.[14] The offender
was almost 18 when it occurred on 31 December 2011.
[146] It was a robbery at a
bakery in Ourimbah where the offender was armed with a ‘shortened
firearm’ and in the company
of an accomplice stole $8 465 in cash as well
as a ring that was valued at $8 000. [45]
The second offence was committed on 9 January 2012, where the offender and
another person stole $3 824.76 from a Hungry Jack’s
at Beresfield. [42]
The pair were ‘armed with a sawn off single-barrel gun and what appeared
to be a black pistol’.
The third offence was a robbery of the McDonalds in Cessnock on 17 January
2012. [48] The offender was in the company of others as
they stole $1 581.25 in
cash and a handbag that had $40 in cash, while armed with a 25cm kitchen knife
and a gun. [50]
The fourth and fifth offences occurred on the same day, 22 January 2012.
[38], [41] The offender, along with others, unsuccessfully
attempted to break
and enter into a taxi base in West Gosford. [41] This was followed by the
robbery of a newsagency at Kariong,
where the offender was alone and had a sawn
off shotgun. [38] Due to the victim’s inability to open the safe, the
stole cash and some chocolates. [38]
Charge 6 occurred when the offender was arrested in a vehicle, in possession
of ‘shortened single shot rifle, found to be in
working order, together
with suitable ammunition and a repeating air pistol, designed as firearm, but
not in working order’.
Offender’s Background
The offender’s background was described twice as
‘pitiable’, by Simpson J and also Ellis DCJ. [31], [99] Additionally
it was also described as lacking in ‘support’. [68] He was born to
an Aboriginal mother, although was removed from her
care before he was 2 and
transferred to his grandparents on the basis of her ‘itinerant lifestyle,
adult sexual activity, substance
abuse, violence, and an erratic parenting
style’. [7], [8] He never met his African-American father. [71] The
offender was
also removed from his grandparents’ care and into several
foster homes, in which he suffered abuse and others who were not
able to cope
with his ‘persistent difficult behaviour’. [8] These family
circumstances preceded living arrangements in
‘various...
placements’. [8]
The offender’s criminal record began when he was 14 years old, which
included time spent in Juvenile Justice custody, [5] and
non-custodial
arrangements. [5] Furthermore, the offender was on parole for an earlier robbery
when he committed each of these offences.
[118] His ‘erious criminal
record for offences of theft, break enter and steal, intimidation, malicious
damage, assault occasioning
actual bodily harm, common assault, affray, and
robbery in company’. [118]
Mild intellectual disabilities affected the offender and was a factor in
making him eligible for a pension. [9] The offender’s
education prospects
have been limited, as he attained Year 8 and then later Year 10, but with
‘limited’ literacy skills.
He had never held employment. [9] He was diagnosed with a number of illnesses
although some were retracted following diagnosis, such
as schizophrenia. [9] It
is on record that the offender made up symptoms of psychological illness to gain
medication. [85] The examining
psychologist assessed the offender as highly at
risk of recidivism. [13] He also has difficulty managing his anger. [77]
The offender has an issue with substance abuse, namely cannabis, ecstasy,
amphetamines, cocaine and heroin. [12] The offender also
sought prescription
drugs. [80] He, however, did not have an addiction to alcohol. It was submitted
that the offending conduct was
a means to support the drug habit. [81]

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/or indicators of disadvantage
The trial judge noted the offender’s ‘deprived and exceedingly
problematic upbringing’. [17] The first point of
appeal was based on a
lack of consideration of such a subjective background. [16] However, the need to
balance the offender’s
subjective background and hardship against the
weight of the crimes committed was emphasised a number of times. [4]
This ground of appeal could not succeed unless it could be proved that
‘the express recognition of the applicant’s history
translate into the sentence imposed’. [19] The court stated that in
Bugmy v The Queen
(2013) 249 CLR 571, ‘the sentencing judge
has sole discretion in considering the numerous and “often
conflicting”
sentencing considerations’. [98] The question, the High
Court held in that case, is whether a sentence has been imposed that
is above or
below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence
consistently with sentencing standards. [19]
In the offender’s case, the
Court of Criminal Appeal characterised the sentencing judge, Ellis DCJ as within
that range, with
‘leniency.... afforded’ to the offender. [152]
‘Ellis DCJ could not approach Harley Johan’s offending
systemically, as being less serious than offending by persons of
ethnicities’ (referring
Munda v Western Australia
[2013] HCA 38
249 CLR 600). [58] It was noted that his youth and background were taken into
account as to his future ability to develop and learn
from experience, although
there was no direct reference to his ability to rehabilitate as ‘a
young’ offender of ‘deprived
circumstances’. [93] Ultimately,
youth and ‘difficult subjective circumstances’ were relevant but
also compared
with a need to address general and specific deterrence in such
serious crimes. [118]
It was also noted in the trial that the offender had given untrue accounts of
the scope and consequences of his background. [59] This
related to the fact that
the offender did not present at the sentence hearing as well as the question of
his remorse.[59]
Comments on Henry principles
The guidelines in
[1999] NSWCCA 111
46 NSWLR 346
considered, however, were held to ‘not specifically apply’. [66] The
appeal court reaffirmed that the principles
were only to be suggestions that
dealt with young offenders with limited criminal records and on trial for only a
single account.
[113] Hence, the principles were discounted, although the
offender did submit the principles as applied incorrectly in his appeal.
In the appeal case, the offender was being sentenced for 6 charges, had a
substantially greater criminal record and the relevant offences
had a longer
maximum sentence (25 versus the 20 years as in
[1999] NSWCCA 111
(1999) 46 NSWLR
The impact of the longer sentence highlighted that it was more severe than
which has been promulgated as the maximum. [110]
Relevant passage(s)
‘There has never been any doubt that a history of deprivation is a
circumstance that warrants, in an appropriate case, some
mitigation of
R v Fernando
(1992) 76 A Crim R 58
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
; 249’. (Leeming J) [15]
‘Circumstances are to be balanced against the need to recognise the
harm done to victims’. (Leeming J, referring to as
Munda v Western
(2013) 249 CLR 600) [15]
‘The facts that an offender is either a juvenile, a young offender, and
has a very deprived background, do not, however, lead
automatically to the
conclusion that an otherwise appropriate sentence, must be reduced’ (Ellis
‘Ellis DCJ could not approach Harley Johan’s offending
systemically, as being less serious than offending by persons of
ethnicities’ (Ellis DCJ). [58]
Grounds of Appeal
by the sentencing judge to give appropriate weight to the offender’s age
and background in assessing his probable culpability;
sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. [30]
Schmidt J held that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be
dismissed. [154] She stated that the trial judge in some cases
‘very lenient result’, [136], [149] even though the
offender’s ‘record did not entitle him to
leniency’. [151]
Leeming JA agreed with the reasons of Schmidt J and her Honour’s
conclusion. [1] Ellis DCJ stated ‘the
overall sentence imposed upon him
was a considerably lenient one’. [96]
The offender will serve a total non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months,
with a balance of 10 years and 6 months. [152]
first ground of appeal was unsuccessful based on the test that the offender
needed ‘express recognition... [that the] history
did not translate into
the sentence imposed’. [19] This was not proven. During this appeal the
mitigating factors under
(Sentencing Procedure) Act
(NSW) were also examined, as well as
Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act
(NSW). [116],
The offender’s submissions in regards to his youth,
mental illness, background and ability to rehabilitate were considered in
case. However, it was ultimately the gravity of his offences and the need for
‘general and specific deterrence’ and
public protection, [18] which
outweighed these (citing
Veen v The Queen (No 2)
[1988] HCA 14
164 CLR 465).
second appeal (manifestly excessive) was unsuccessful, as the Court was not
convinced that the overall sentence met the test of
‘unreasonable or
plainly unjust’. [98] It held that each sentence was in the allowable
range for the udge. [98] The Court
mentioned that it could not replace the
judge’s discretion for its own (citing
Vuni v Regina
[2006] NSWCCA
The appeal court held that the original sentences were
‘within the “ballpark”’ of a reasonable sentence. [101]
Ellis DCJ had appropriately undertaken ‘an instinctive synthesis of the
kind discussed in
Markarian v The Queen
[2005] HCA 25
(2005) 228 CLR
In regards to the second appeal, the Appeal Court
agreed with the sentencing judge that the
guidelines did not apply
to the ‘multiple, more serious’ offences of a young offender with a
considerable criminal record.
The dicta of Simpson J was that the leave to appeal be granted and the appeal
allowed in part. [27] She was persuaded by the second
appeal in light of the
offender’s background which produced ‘powerful mitigating
circumstances’ and guilty plea,
also when taking into account the
principles, that the sentences for the first three charges were
‘unreasonable and plainly unjust’. [26]
