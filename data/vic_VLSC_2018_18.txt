Commissioner Determination (Inadequate costs disclosure)
[2018] VLSC 18
Date of Determination:
24 June 2018
to section 290(2)(a) of the Uniform Law, I make the following order –
Respondent Lawyer be cautioned.
to section 290(2)(c) of the Uniform Law, I make the following order –
The Law Practice
reduces its fees from $10,754.96 to $7,258.54 (inclusive of GST), a reduction of
I have made this order in relation to legal
costs charged by the Law Practice to the Complainant regarding the following
­ Invoice dated 28 October 2016, for an amount of $1,740.01 (‘Bill
­ Invoice dated 28 November 2016, for an amount of $6,414.98 (‘Bill
­ Invoice dated 9 December 2016 for an amount of $2,599.97 (‘Bill
(collectively, the ‘Bills’)
Pursuant to section 292 of the Uniform Law, I consider the amount of legal
costs that are fair and reasonable in relation to the Bills
to be $7,258.54. The
Complainant has already paid $7,000.00 to the Law Practice.
STATEMENT OF REASONS
29 September 2016, the Complainant engaged the Respondent Lawyer to assist her
with a Family Law matter, and a hearing on 30 November
10 October 2016, the Respondent Lawyer sent the Complainant a Costs Agreement
and Disclosure Statement estimating total legal costs
to be $58,000.00. The
Disclosure Statement also provided for different amounts for each stage of the
matter. When added together,
the legal costs listed for each stage in the Cost
Agreement amounted to $73,000.00.
13 October 2016, the Complainant transferred $2,000.00 into the Law
Practice’s trust account.
the period 3 November 2016 to 24 November 2016, the Respondent Lawyer requested
the Complainant transfer additional funds to
the Law Practice’s trust
account to complete her work. The Lawyer advised of the Law Practice’s
policy that payment of
funds into trust was required before work could be
undertaken.
25 November 2016, the Respondent Lawyer emailed the Complainant, requesting
$3,000.00 be paid into the Law Practice’s trust
account by 12:00PM on 28
November 2016 in anticipation of Counsel’s costs, and also advising that
no further work would be
carried out and the retainer would cease if payment was
28 November 2016, the Respondent Lawyer gave notice that the Law Practice ceased
the retainer and would no longer act.
9 December 2016, my office received the Complainant’s complaint about the
Respondent Lawyer.
Complainant and Respondent Lawyer were unsuccessful in their attempts to resolve
the dispute informally.
Issues under investigation
Complainant raised the following allegations in her complaint, which have been
under investigation –
the Law Practice’s legal costs are fair and reasonable; and
the Law Practice terminated the retainer for just

rise to confusion and ambiguity to the Costs Agreement, voiding the Costs

regarding queries and payment of the Law Practice’s

an email dated 10 October 2018, the Law Practice sent the Costs Agreement and
Disclosure Statement to the Complainant. The Disclosure
Statement explicitly
states at clause 12.5 that the agreement to work on the Complainant’s
behalf may cease if the Complainant
fails to pay any accounts, statement or
retainer funds in accordance with the agreement.
Respondent Lawyer made several attempts to have the Complainant deposit funds
into the Law Practice’s trust account. Given
that no payment had been
received in response to requests for payment, the Respondent Lawyer notified the
Complainant on 28 November
2016 that the Law Practice was ceasing to act for her
in accordance with the Costs Agreement.
Complainant has submitted that there was a technical error with her computer and
she was unable to comply with the request of
