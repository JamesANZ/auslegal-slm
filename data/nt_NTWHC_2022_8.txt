REASONS FOR DECISION
(Delivered 19 October
ACTING JUDGE O’LOUGHLIN
Introduction
is the second decision on costs and interest in a matter which substantially
resolved on 9 June 2022. At that time the Employer
consented to orders for the
payment of past compensation and interest under
Work Act 1986
(“the Act”). On 15 August 2022, the Court further
ordered the Employer to pay interest under
subsection 109
the consent order, the Employer has raised new grounds to resist paying the
Worker the past compensation.
Worker has now applied for a further order specifying the amount of arrears to
be paid, and applied for an award of interest under
subsection 109
August 2020, the Employer accepted the Worker's claim and paid benefits until
February 2021 when the Employer disputed liability.
Worker issued proceedings to challenge the cancellation. On 9 June 2022, after
some interlocutory success to the Worker, the Employer
abandoned its case and
consented to the following order:
“The Employer is to pay the Worker all outstanding compensation from
15 February to the date of this order.”
September 2022, the Employer had failed to comply with the above order as it
stated it required a taxation declaration and further
medical certificates
confirming ongoing incapacity.
no stage did the Employer suggest that its consent to the above order was
subject to the Worker producing medical certificates
and a taxation declaration.
The Court Order certainly does not state that the order is subject to these (or
any) conditions.
the lack of merit in the Employer’s demands the Worker has provided two
medical certificates covering the disputed period
and I fail to see why a tax
declaration would be required if the Employer had paid the Worker via her
solicitors trust account (as
was requested).
find the arrears in compensation should have been paid no more than two weeks
after 9 June 2022, and the Employer is acting unreasonably
in raising new
grounds to defer the payment.
16 September 2022, the Employer had continued to decline to pay for the week
following 15 February 2022 and the four months between
9 March and 4 July 2022.
109(2) of the Act allows for additional interest if the Employer has not made
weekly payments in a regular manner or in
accordance with the normal manner of
payment. After abandoning its challenge to the Worker’s entitlement to
compensation,
and consenting to orders to pay arrears, the Employer was liable
to resume making regular weekly payments to the Worker. The Employer
has thereby
failed to make the weekly payments at all (let alone in a regular manner).
Employer’s explanation for its failure to pay weekly benefits as ordered
is described above and that explanation is weak
and section 109 (2) interest is
warranted. The fact that the Employer failed to comply with an order for
specious reasons calls for
a higher rate of interest and I will award 12 per
cent. Those benefits should have been paid by 23 June 2022 and the 109(2)
should be calculated from that date.
costs were considered by Riley CJ in
BAE Systems Australia v Rothwell
[2013] NTCA 3
(2013) 275 FLR 244
“Indemnity costs may be awarded in a variety of circumstances, and
the categories in which such orders may be made are not closed
Examples of circumstances where costs may be ordered on an indemnity basis
include where a party has pursued a matter which,
on proper consideration,
should have been seen to be a hopeless case and where there was undue
prolongation of a case by groundless
contentions.”
Employer should have paid the benefits months ago and its groundless objections
have unnecessarily prolonged the case. The Worker
is therefore entitled to her
costs of this application on an indemnity basis.
Worker has provided calculations of section 65 arrears and section 89 interest
under the Act, which appear correct and have not
be challenged by the Employer.
These amounts will be ordered.
addition to earlier awards of interest, the Employer is also to pay interest
under subsection 109 (2) at the rate of 12 per cent
for the weeks of unpaid
section 65 compensation for the period of 23 June 2021 until the date of
Employer to make payment of the Worker’s section 65 benefits in the amount
of $91,294.34 (less PAYG taxation) to Maurice
Blackburn’s Trust
Employer to make payment of the Worker’s section 89 interest in the amount
of $4,078.99 to Maurice Blackburn’s Trust
Employer pay the Worker’s costs of and incidental to this interlocutory
application at 100 per cent of the Supreme Court
Scale, taxed in default of
agreement on an indemnity basis.
