and to call upon the assistance
of others to implement accommodation decisions
(coercive) – subject person refused to participate in the hearing –
renewed for three years.
REASONS FOR DECISION
Date of order
: 4 December 2013
What the Tribunal decided
Tribunal reviewed the previous guardianship order for Mr WSU and renewed it for
a period of three years and varied as follows:
The Public Guardian was appointed
as guardian with authority to make decisions for him about his accommodation,
health care, medical
and dental treatment and his access to services. The
guardian was authorised to override Mr WSU’s objections to medical
and was also authorised to utilise the assistance of others to
implement accommodation decisions.
WSU is 60 years old and usually lives in his own home in regional NSW. At the
time of the hearing Mr WSU was a patient at a Mental
Health unit in regional
WSU has been subject to a guardianship order since 20 December 2010. That order
was renewed on 16 December 2011 when the Public
Guardian was appointed to make
decisions for Mr WSU about his accommodation, services, health care,
medical/dental treatment. On
9 March 2012 the Tribunal conducted a requested
review of that order and varied the order to include authorisation for the
to override Mr WSU’s objections to medical treatment.
hearing conducted on 4 December 2013 was an end-of-term review of the order made
on 16 December 2011 and varied on 9 March 2012.
it makes a decision the Tribunal must try to bring the parties to a settlement
if this is possible and appropriate. There was
no dispute in this matter.
However Mr WSU said via a nurse on duty that he did not wish to participate in
the hearing.
What did Tribunal have to decide?
questions which have to be decided by the Tribunal are:
someone for whom the Tribunal could make an order because he continues to have a
disability which prevents him from being
able to make important life
Tribunal make a further guardianship order and if so, what order should be made?
Who should be
the guardian?
How long should
the order last?
Is Mr WSU someone for whom the Tribunal
could make a further order because he continues to have a disability which
prevents him from
being able to make important life decisions
Guardianship Act 1987
provides that the Tribunal may make a
guardianship order for a person if it is satisfied that he/she is “a
person in need of
a guardian.” A person in need of a guardian is “a
person who because of a disability is totally or partially incapable
of managing
his or her person”
(section 3(1)
Guardianship Act 1987
). A person
with a disability is a person who is:
intellectually ,
physically, psychologically or sensorily disabled
of advanced
a mentally ill
person within the meaning of the
Mental Health Act 2007
and by virtue of that fact is restricted in one
or more major life activities to such an extent that he or she requires
supervision
or social habilitation
(section 3(2)
Guardianship Act 1987
the previous orders were made, the Tribunal found that Mr WSU had a traumatic
brain injury and was unable to make important life
current Tribunal referred to an Aged Care Assessment dated 22 October 2013 which
refers to a number of conditions affecting Mr
WSU including:
Lack of insight
into his brain injury.
Confusion and
disorientation.
A 2011 diagnosis
of dementia with frontal lobe impairment characterised by perseveration,
concreteness, poor executive functioning,
poor attention and memory
Tribunal also had regard to a letter dated 25 October 2013 from Dr YNT, a
psychiatrist, noting that Mr WSU has diagnoses of both
traumatic brain injury
and dementia secondary to neurodegeneration. She notes that the diagnosis of
dementia had been confirmed by
cognitive testing conducted by neuropsychiatrist,
into account the previous decisions of the Tribunal and the more recent
evidence, the Tribunal was satisfied that Mr WSU has
a combination of conditions
that restrict his ability to make decisions about his lifestyle and as result of
which he is at least
partially unable to manage his person and requires some
assistance and some supervision. Therefore
he is a person for whom the
Tribunal could make a further guardianship order.
Tribunal make a further guardianship order and what order should be
Tribunal was in receipt of report dated 27 November 2013 from a representative
of the Public Guardian. The representative provides
information to the following
In 2011 Mr WSU
was discharged from a Mental Health Facility in a regional location and was
supported at home by agencies. However
he developed cellulitis and a DVT and up
until March 2012 refused Warfarin treatment for the DVT. As a result he was
readmitted to
the mental health facility.
On 30 March
2012 he was transferred to a Mental Health Unit after assaulting another
admission to the Mental Health facilities Mr WSU’s health has deteriorated
and his needs have increased and accommodation
options were being investigated.
It was unclear whether he would be able to return home.
Mr WSU continued
to refuse medical treatment and his compliance with medical treatment was poor.
Should Mr WSU
services which he was likely to try to discontinue.
Public Guardian’s representative recommends that the order be renewed and
that the guardian be provided with the functions
of making decisions about Mr
WSU’s accommodation, services, health care and his medical/dental
treatment and that that the
guardian be authorised to override his objections to
medical treatment.
a letter dated 1 March 2012 addressed to the Public Guardian’s
representative, Dr GRE, Medical Director of the Community
Acute Post Acute Care
Service, provides details about Mr WSU’s cellulitis and DVT and his
refusal of medication an states that
he was at significant risk
“principally from pulmonary embolus and secondarily from longer term
vascular complications”.
a report of an assessment conducted on 23 August 2013, Ms BLE, an Occupational
Therapist provides information regarding Mr WSU’s
functional capacity and
concludes that he requires a placement that can ensure medication compliance,
provide meals and laundry services
and assist him with is self care activities.
the hearing the Public Guardian’s representative said that she had been
attempting to get funding for the support of
Mr WSU in the community and this
had been successful but his capacity then declined so that he now requires full
time assistance
and would therefore need increased funding. She said that whilst
he fits criteria for placement in an aged care facility, the complications
resulting from his brain injury render his unsuitable for any facility that she
had considered. The Public Guardian’s representative
said that Mr WSU
refuses any suggested accommodation options and that implementing an
accommodation decisions would require the assistance
of services.
WSL, the brother of Mr WSU, said that he considered that full time care would
need to be available if he were to live in the community,
whilst Mr SDF
expressed the view that Mr WSU is not able to live in the community.
SDF said that in his opinion when Mr WSU refuses medication he does so without
understanding the nature of the treatment or the
reason for it. He said that Mr
WSU does not believe that he had a DVT. He said that the clots have now cleared,
but that when Mr
WSU previously ceased treatment the clots recurred. He said
that Mr WSU is also prescribed clonazepam, a major medication, because
all of these matters into consideration the Tribunal was satisfied that it
should make a guardianship order appointing a guardian
to make decisions for Mr
WSU about his accommodation, services, health care and his medical treatment and
that the guardian should
be authorised to utilise the assistance of others to
implement an accommodation decisions and should be authorised to override Mr
WSU’s objections to treatment.
Who should be the
is no private person available to be appointed as guardian, therefore, the
Tribunal decided to appoint the Public Guardian.
How long should
the order last?
guardianship order made on review can be made for a period of up to three years
from the date on which it was made. However, an
order of up to five years can be
made, if the person the subject of the order has permanent disabilities, is
unlikely to become capable
of managing his or her person and there is the need
for an order longer than three years. The Public Guardian’s representative
recommended that the order be renewed for three years because in her opinion Mr
WSU’s decision-making capacity would not improve
and he is likely to
continue to require lifestyle decisions to be made. Taking these matters into
account the Tribunal decided to
make an order for three years.
