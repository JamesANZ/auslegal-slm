REASONS FOR
(REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT)
1 On 10 December 2021, the respondent, John
, sought to purge his
contempt of which I convicted him on 24 September 2021, namely:
1A. On the charges of contempt in the amended
application in proceeding filed on 24 August 2020, it be declared that the
is guilty and convicted of contempt of the Court for
contravening:
(a) order 4 made on 23 February 2018, as varied by order 1 made on 1 March
2018, namely that, within 28 days of 23 February 2018,
he pay Dr Ping-Fat Sze
the sum of AUD433.69 (inclusive of interest from 1 July 2007) by wilfully and
contumaciously not making any
payment to Dr Sze as ordered or at all, and
(b) order 6 made on 23 February 2018, namely that he pay the applicant’s
costs of and incidental to the proceeding, such costs
to be taxed, if not
agreed, by wilfully and contumaciously not making any payment to the applicant
as ordered or at all of the whole
or any part of the costs as certified in the
certificate of costs assessment in the sum of $143,775.67 issued on 24 June 2019
served on the respondent on 25 June
2 On 24 September 2021 I gave
reasons for those convictions
and imposed a sentence of six months imprisonment to commence on 17 December
2021, unless the Court
otherwise ordered. I allowed Mr Walsh the opportunity,
that he took up, of applying to purge his contempt.
Evidence on this application
3 On 10 December 2021 Mr Walsh appeared by counsel
for the first time. He verified his affidavit and the following apology:
I, John Walsh of Brannagh, of the Brotherhood of St
Laurence Aged Care ... pensioner, make this unreserved and sincere apology to
Chief Justice Besanko and Justice Gilmour of the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island
and Justice Wigney of the Federal Court of Australia
for the comments I made in
the course of representing myself at the hearing on 24 September 2021. I
compounded my contempt of court
for wilfully failing to pay Fat Ping Sze and the
Registrar of Norfolk Island Supreme Court by making scandalous allegations
the judges referred to above.
4 In his evidence, Mr Walsh acknowledged that, earlier, he had not given a
full and frank explanation of his assets. He said he had
no hidden assets and
that, since being made bankrupt in Australia, his only asset of substance was a
Norfolk Island bank account
in the name of
United Pacific
Corporation Pty
Ltd – Australian Constitutional Trust, that he effectively controlled for
his private purposes (
the United Pacific account
). That account had been
affected by the freezing order that I had made on 17 June 2021 that expired on 6
August 2021.
5 Mr Walsh said that he believed he was innocent of the contempt charges but
accepted the Court’s findings and sincerely apologised
for his previously
defiant conduct. He gave evidence that his only income is his aged pension of
which he must pay for his accommodation at his
aged care home, leaving him about $231 per fortnight for his expenses, such as
mobile phone, medical and pharmaceutical bills not covered by Medicare, and
the like. He said that his only assets comprised his
law library, reference
books and 2.5 million shares in a failed business venture to establish a
university on Norfolk Island.
6 Mr Walsh testified that he was in poor health, had glaucoma and needed
cataract surgery, which would cost over $10,000. Mr Walsh
noted that an
organisation called “United We Stand Up” had approached the
Registrar, the applicant in this proceeding,
in relation to paying his judgment
debts. However, as his counsel acknowledged 15 December 2021 and as appears to
be still the
position, that organisation, whatever it is, has not paid any of
7 During his cross-examination by the Registrar’s counsel, I formed the
impression that Mr Walsh was not always able to focus
on answering the questions
that he was asked in a manner that is consistent with the frailty of mind often
found in elderly persons.
I am satisfied that he has expressed remorse and has
acknowledged that his defiant, contumacious behaviour was wrong in the period
between the time in February 2018 when Gilmour J ordered him to pay Dr Ping-Fat
Sze and the Registrar’s costs, up to and including
when I sentenced him on
24 September 2021. I accept Mr Walsh’s evidence that he now regrets that
he neither obeyed nor attempted
to comply with the orders made by Gilmour J, and
now accepts that he was bound by the Court orders.
8 On 15 December 2021 I stayed the sentence of imprisonment that I imposed on
24 September 2021 that was to have commenced on 17 December
2021 until further
The parties’ submissions
9 Mr Walsh’s counsel asked on 10 and 15
December 2021 that I order the sum currently standing to the credit of the
United Pacific
account be sequestrated to ensure payment of the amount now due
to Dr Sze and part of the Registrar’s costs. He seeks that
I vacate the
orders for imprisonment and indemnity costs that I made on 24 September 2021 in
respect of the contempt proceeding.
Mr Walsh argued that the indemnity costs
order would hang over his head in circumstances where he has no assets from
which to pay
it and that he would be at risk of further charge of contempt if
that occurs.
10 The Registrar opposed Mr Walsh’s application. He argued that Mr
Walsh did not sufficiently purge his contempt. He contended
that the fresh
medical evidence that Mr Walsh suffers from depression and hearing loss does not
excuse or explain his past contumacious
conduct or provide a reason not to
enforce the order for imprisonment. He submitted that the indemnity costs order
was properly
made and ought not be varied. He argued that the sentencing
choices were limited and that imprisonment was still the only appropriate
penalty, given Mr Walsh’s impecuniosity.
Consideration
11 Punishment for contempt serves two functions:
, enforcement of the process and orders of the Court, disobedience
to which can be described as “civil contempt”, and
the punishment of other acts which impede the administration of justice, such
as, essentially, obstructing the proceedings of the
Court while it is sitting or
publishing comments on a pending case, which can be described as
“criminal contempt”, as
Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ
observed in
Australasian Meat Industry Employees’ Union v Mudginberri
Station Pty Limited
[1986] HCA 46
(1986) 161 CLR 98
at 106. They held that while there is
a theoretical distinction between civil and criminal contempt, the underlying
rationale for
the power is that it is “necessary to uphold and protect the
effective administration of justice” (161 CLR at 107).
Nonetheless, a
proceeding, including punishment, for contempt is a matter that arises on the
civil side of the Court’s jurisdiction:
Construction, Forestry, Mining
and Energy Union v Boral Reserves (Vic) Pty Ltd
[2015] HCA 21
(2015) 256 CLR 375
388–390 [40]–[46] per French CJ, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler and Keane
12 Mr Walsh’s earlier contemptuous conduct was, as I found, a
deliberate interference with the administration of justice, and
warranted, at
that time, a significant punishment. Here, Mr Walsh has now explained that he
recognises his previous defiance and
disobedience of the Court’s orders
was wrong. As I have noted, he has not completely purged his contempt, but has
do so in a manner I consider to be sufficiently genuine, so that it is
no longer appropriate to maintain a sentence of imprisonment
to protect the
effective administration of justice. I have taken into account his age, health,
circumstances, and the apparent impact
of the ageing process on how he gave his
oral evidence. Mr Walsh has accepted that the moneys held in the United Pacific
should be sequestrated in order to meet, in part, the payments that, up
to now, he has failed to make to Dr Sze and the Registrar,
and I will make an
order to achieve that end.
Hughes v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
[2004] FCAFC 319
247 FCR 277
at 292–293 [55], French, Emmett and Dowsett JJ identified the
range of penalties available to the Court to punish for contempt
as being to
commit the contemnor to prison for an indefinite period of time; impose a fine
for a wilful breach of an order or undertaking;
impose a daily fine; order
sequestration of assets of the contemnor and to suspend, on condition, any
sentence of imprisonment
that it might impose in respect of the contempt.
14 I am not persuaded that I should vary the indemnity costs order for the
contempt proceedings. That is not to say that on the evidence,
necessarily would commit any further contempt by not paying the whole of those
costs when taxed, given his financial circumstances
of dependence on the aged
pension. One condition I will impose is that Mr Walsh arranges for a direct
debit to be made on his bank
account into which his pension is paid for $100 per
fortnight, to meet the already taxed but unpaid costs order made by Gilmour J.
15 One purpose of making orders to punish persons for contempt, as in
sentencing for criminal offences, and imposing civil penalties,
is to deter
others from feeling they may engage in similar conduct. An order for costs in
civil litigation is not punitive. Ordinarily,
impecuniosity is not reason to
deny a wholly successful party in litigation any entitlement to costs. There
cannot be, in effect,
one law for the rich and another for the poor. The fact
that a person cannot pay the costs if ordered to do so does not create a
situation where the justice of the case requires that a wholly successful party
should be deprived of such an order. A party’s
difficulties in complying
with orders to pay money, including costs, can be accommodated by making orders
such as instalment payments:
Northern Territory v Sangare
[2019] HCA 19
(2019) 265 CLR
, and 176–177 [34]–[35], per Kiefel CJ, Bell,
Gageler, Keane and Nettle JJ.
16 A failure by him in the future to pay costs when he is unable by reason of
lack of financial resources or assets to do so may not
be a contempt, if it does
not signify any defiance of the Court’s authority as opposed to simply
simply, an incapacity to meet
his obligations.
17 Imprisonment is a sentence of last resort.
Having regard to the significant change in Mr Walsh’s respect for the
orders and authority, his willingness to have the United Pacific
account sequestrated to meet, in part, his liabilities, and to submit
payment of $100 per fortnight out of his pension, together with his genuine, but
not wholly complete, attempt to purge his
contempt, I am satisfied that it is
appropriate to vacate the order for imprisonment made on 24 September 2021, and
in lieu, make
the orders I have foreshadowed.
