REASONS FOR DECISION – APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT
Issued in accordance with
section 7.36(5)
Accident Injuries Act 2017
INTRODUCTION
claimant and the insurer have reached an agreement on an amount of $55,000 to
compensate the claimant for his entitlement to damages
pursuant to the
Accident Injuries Act 2017
(the claimant) was injured in a motor vehicle accident at ABC on 29 June 2018.
While driving along 123 Road at about 70 km/h,
he and a vehicle travelling
behind him were overtaken by a vehicle insured by GIO. The overtaking vehicle
has hit a bump in the road,
swerved and impacted heavily with the
claimant’s vehicle, causing it to roll and come to rest in a paddock.
claimant was injured in the accident and taken by ambulance to the XX Hospital
where he was found to be suffering scalp lacerations,
a soft tissue injury to
his cervical spine aggravating underlying degenerative changes and a partial
thickness tear of the supraspinatus
tendon in the right
lodged a claim for personal injury benefits against GIO insurance. The claim was
accepted and benefits have been paid to date.
Treatment and care expenses will
continue to be payable.
claimant has continued to consult his general practitioner and has undergone
physiotherapy and two cortisone injections into the
shoulder (the second being
less successful in controlling his pain). He continues to take medication. He
experiences ongoing pain
in the right shoulder, especially aggravated by driving
which is required to do extensively as part of his work as a construction
manager in the telecommunications field. He is concerned about degeneration in
his shoulder and whether he will continue working
to age 67. Recently, he took
several days off work to recover after doing field work.
informed me that there have been discussions about possible surgery but that his
surgeon, Dr Salario, has described that as a
last resort. He is to see a
different specialist and anticipates that he may undergo further cortisone
injections into the shoulder.
HISTORY OF THIS DISPUTE
claimant lodged an Application for Damages Under Common Law Damages on 3 March
2020. The parties have negotiated verbally and
an agreement has been reached on
a settlement figure.
the claimant is unrepresented, the insurer has lodged this application for
approval of the settlement reached between it and the
claimant of his
entitlement to common law damages for injuries arising from his motor vehicle
settlement figure of $55,000, clear of the benefits already paid to or on behalf
of ARJ, comprises past and future economic loss
only. The claimant is now aged
62 and is in full-time employment. No amount has been included as compensation
for ARJ’s pain
and suffering as the insurer determined, based on the
opinion of orthopaedic specialist, Dr Ian Barrett, that his whole person
did not clear the threshold of 10%. In fact, the doctor found a whole
person impairment of 10%, being 5% for each of the neck and
the right shoulder.
Dr Barrett did not consider any scarring and whether that might be a rateable
impairment.
was concerned that the claimant might be foregoing a chance to obtain an award
of damages for his pain and suffering and therefore,
with the consent of both
the claimant and the insurer, I referred the matter to be assessed by a DRS
medical assessor. Assessor Ian
Cameron assessed the claimant and certified on 26
October 2020 that his whole person impairment did not exceed the 10% threshold
in relation to whole person impairment.
Cameron recorded the claimant’s current symptoms as
“ARJ said that he has pain and clicking from his right shoulder.
This is worse when reaching or when having static postures
for a long time,
particularly when driving. There is also right sided trapezial pain. This is
worse on movement of the neck. There
is no specific neck pain. ARJ reported that
he had a scalp laceration glued together, that has sealed and that is
asymptomatic”.
assessor noted that the scalp scar was very small and inconspicuous. He found
moderately and symmetrically reduced range of motion
in the neck and reduced
range of motion in the right shoulder. He noted that an ultrasound of the right
shoulder on 12 July 2018
stated there was
"small bursal surface partial
thickness supraspinatus tear".
An MRI of the right shoulder on 22 November
2019 is reported as showing,
"there are areas of focal tendinopathy in
rotator cuff tendons as described with the largest being a supraspinatus
anterior 13 mm
but only approximately 30 to 50% partial thickness tear deep
SHOULD THE SETTLEMENT BE APPROVED?
the last preliminary conference on 16 November 2020 I received from the insurer
a breakdown of the proposed settlement figure,
which comprised $5,000 for past
economic loss and $50,000 for future economic loss. I asked for a further
breakdown of the figure
for past economic loss and received a comprehensive
calculation which satisfies me that the claimant’s entitlement to past
economic loss, which comprises the gap between his statutory payments and his
actual lost wages, lost superannuation and the equivalent
"Fox v Wood"
component, had been included in the $5,000 allowed for past economic
am satisfied that the allowance of $50,000 for future economic loss is
appropriate, noting that the claimant is aged 62 and holds
a very responsible
and well-paid managerial position for a construction firm. He will require time
off work from time to time to
rest his shoulder and may possibly require a
lengthy period of work should he undergo shoulder reconstruction
am satisfied that the proposed settlement figure is an appropriate one and that
it complies with the requirements of Clause 7.402.2
of the Guidelines, in that
just, fair and reasonable and within the range of likely
potential damages assessment for the claim were the matter to be assessed
claims assessor, taking into account the nature and extent of the claim and the
injuries, disabilities, impairments and losses
sustained by the
Accordingly,
pursuant to
Section 6.23
Motor Accident Injuries Act
, Section 7.396 of the
Motor Accident Guidelines,
proposed settlement of the claimant’s claim for damages is
