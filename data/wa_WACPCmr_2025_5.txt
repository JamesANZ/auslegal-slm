Reasons for Decision
the requested minor modification result in additional maintenance costs for the
The landlord has advised the structural integrity of the wall
would be compromised if the current and future occupants of the premises
installed and removed television brackets over the next ten years. In written
submissions to Consumer Protection, the landlord stated:
“The property has been leased for 10 years, and (sic) on average
tenants have requested to move out every 2 years. If over the
following 10
years, 5 more tenants lived there and each wanted wall mounted tv's. The wall
would have 4x5 x2 holes drilled through
the walls only covered by a small amount
of patch and paint. If another 10 years goes by, this would be a total
of 80 holes, 40 in
each TV location.”
The landlord’s
submission presumes a pattern of many future tenants making similar requests
over the next two decades. This
argument is based on future hypothetical
scenarios, rather than the immediate circumstances of the tenant’s
request. I am required
to assess the likelihood of additional maintenance costs
arising directly from the tenant’s minor modification request, rather
on speculation about what may occur in future tenancies. The landlord’s
argument does not address the actual impact of
this particular request, nor does
it demonstrate a direct connection between the requested modification and
increased maintenance
The landlord has stated: “Patching
and painting holes from the removal of the brackets will result in additional
avoidable maintenance
costs to the landlord as the holes will remain within the
wall cavity due to the high depth of large anchors required to secure the
television brackets”.
The landlord has not supplied any
third-party evidence demonstrating how the requested modification would increase
maintenance costs,
why that maintenance would be required, and the actual cost
of the maintenance.
Considering the information supplied by the landlord, I am not satisfied that
the requested minor modification would result in additional
maintenance costs
for the landlord.
Would removing the requested modification, or restoring the premises to
their original condition, cost more than the bond or not be
practicable?
The landlord has submitted the following reasons as to why
the costs could exceed the security bond:
restoring process is only to patch and paint.
The wall will
still have holes in it which will not be restored.
Over the life of
the property if more tenants do this, it could cause damage that exceeds bond as
bond may be used to rectify other
Wall damage is
structural and likely expensive”.
The landlord has
not supplied any third-party evidence to show the cost of restoring the premises
to their original condition is likely
to cost more than the held security bond
The landlord has not demonstrated why it is not reasonably
practicable to restore the premises back to their original condition.
At the end of the tenancy, the tenant has an obligation to ensure that the
premises are left in as close as possible to the same
condition compared to when
the moved in, less any fair wear and
Considering the information, I am not satisfied that removing the requested
modification, or restoring the premises to their original
condition, would cost
more than the bond or not be reasonably practicable.
Is making the requested minor modification unreasonable in the
circumstances?
In written submissions to Consumer Protection, the
landlord stated they are happy to approve small child safety anchors that anchor
a television sitting on furniture to the wall, as these require fewer and
smaller drilling holes.
The landlord submits that making the requested
minor modification is unreasonable because a suitable alternative has been
to the tenant.
While the landlord has proposed an alternative
solution involving child safety anchors, this suggestion does not demonstrate
making the requested minor modification is unreasonable.
Considering the information from the landlord and the tenant, I am not satisfied
that making the requested minor modification is
unreasonable in the
circumstances.
A tenant or landlord who is dissatisfied with this decision can appeal to the
Magistrates Court of Western Australia. Appeals must
be lodged within seven days
