FOR DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
Introduction
an application dated 4 July 2025, Ventura Home Group Pty Ltd (
applied for review of a Building Remedy Order (a
) made on 6 June 2025
Building Services (Complaint Resolution and Administration)
Building Services Act
) by a delegate of the Building
Commissioner in relation to a home owned by Simon Bosnich (
being BRO O2024-2169 (
BRO requires the applicant, amongst other things, to conduct a full home re-pipe
of Typlex piping that the applicant had installed
in the respondent's house.
pipes installed in the respondent's house have various names in the documents
before me, including Typlex, Pro-Fit, and Iplex
pipes. In these reasons I will
call them 'the pipes'.
applicant is a company in the BGC group of companies (
an application dated 18 August 2025, the applicant applied for interlocutory
orders, as follows:
(a) staying the operation of the BRO pending
further order of the Tribunal, pursuant to
Administrative Tribunal Act 2004
(b) adjourning the proceeding pending further order of the Tribunal, pursuant
to s 32(5) or, alternatively, s 32(7)(e) of the SAT
the applications
applications were heard at the same time as identical applications in three
other matters,
concerning a BRO in similar terms to the BRO requiring either the applicant or
another company in the BGC Group, J-Corp Pty
Ltd, to conduct a full home re-pipe
(amongst other things) of houses owned by the respondents in those proceedings.
Separate reasons
have been delivered in those matters. These reasons refer to
the reasons given in J-Corp Pty Ltd and McCutcheon &
J-Corp Pty Ltd and McCutcheon
[2025] WASAT 121 (
J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons
principal basis on which the stay was sought was to ensure that the applicant is
not required to carry out the work required
under the BRO before the proceedings
for review of the decision to make the BRO (
review proceedings
) have been
determined.
adjournment was sought to delay the review proceedings until determination of
the applicant's application in the Supreme Court,
commenced on 13 June 2025, for
judicial review of the decision of a delegate of the Building Commissioner to
make a BRO relating
to the pipes installed in a house that is not the subject of
any of the four applications before me (
Supreme Court proceedings
respondent and the intervenor opposed the application for an adjournment. The
respondent also opposed the application for a
stay. The intervenor did not
oppose the stay.
18 September 2025, I decided to make orders in the terms set out at the
conclusion of these reasons (
), in summary,
(a) grant the application to stay the operation of the BRO until
further order of the Tribunal, upon the applicant providing the respondent
an undertaking as to damages in the form set out in the Orders;
(b) refuse the application for an adjournment of the review proceedings;
(c) program the review proceedings to a directions hearing to progress the
matter to a hearing.
18 September 2025, I said that I would produce written reasons for my decision
to make the Orders. These are those reasons.
I have incorporated paragraphs from the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons into these
reasons, references to the applicant in those
paragraphs are to be read as a
reference to the applicant in this matter and a reference to the respondents in
those paragraphs is
to be read as a reference to the respondent in this
determining the applications, I have had reference to the following
affidavits:
(a) the affidavit of Adam
Casotti sworn on 18 August 2025. Mr Casotti is a registered building
contractor and an employee of BGC
Group involved in the managing, investigating
and coordinating of BGC Group's response to plumbing failures relating to the
(b) the affidavit of Luke Swanson, sworn on 18 August 2025. Mr Swanson
is a partner of the firm of lawyers acting for the applicant;
(c) the affidavit of the respondent affirmed on 7 September 2025;
(d) the affidavit of Lilly Deluca affirmed on 11 September 2025. Ms Deluca
is a lawyer employed by the firm of lawyers acting for
the applicant; and
(e) the affidavit of Aleksandra Miller affirmed
on 12 September 2025. Ms Miller is a lawyer employed by the State Solicitor's
acting for the intervenor.
addition, I have had reference to documents attached to Mr Swanson's
affidavits sworn in two of the other three applications before
(a) attachments LFS 21 to LFS 35 to Mr Swanson's affidavit
sworn on 1 August 2024, being copies of court documents filed in the Supreme
Court proceedings and proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia, and a copy
Government Gazette
published on 12 November 2024 containing the
Western Australian Plumbing Failure Policy
(b) attachment LFS 12, attached to Mr Swanson's affidavit sworn on 18 August
2025 being an amended application filed in the Supreme
Court proceedings dated 8
August 2025.
his written submissions, the respondent's counsel adopted the written
submissions filed by the first and second respondents in
J-Corp and McCutcheon.
The applicant's submissions applied equally across all four of the matters
Accordingly,
the matters referred to in [14] to [29] of the reasons in J-Corp and McCutcheon
apply equally to the applications in
this matter and I incorporate what is said
in those paragraphs into these reasons.
addition, the respondent's counsel submitted that the applications should be
refused because of the delay in bringing the applications,
and that the
respondent was not bound by the outcome in the Supreme Court proceedings.
is said in [30] to [31] applies equally to the applications in this matter and
for those reasons, in my view, the most appropriate
approach is to consider the
applications together.
light of the relevant factors in relation to both the application for a stay and
the application for an adjournment, these reasons
proceed with a consideration
of the following factors:
(a) the statutory framework.
(b) any prejudice to the applicant if a stay, or an adjournment, is not
granted, the latter of which includes consideration of the
prospects of success
in the Supreme Court Proceedings;
(c) any delay by the applicant in bringing the applications;
(d) any prejudice to the respondent if a stay, or an adjournment, is granted,
which includes consideration of the impact of delay;
(e) whether there is a serious question to be determined in the review
proceedings;
(f) the public interest;
(g) the impact of an adjournment on the Tribunal's objectives; and
(h) where the balance of convenience lies.
I say in these reasons should not be construed as findings of fact. In so far
as I express views on the relative strength of
the parties' positions on various
issues, they are not more than preliminary views, based on untested
Statutory framework
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [35] to [41], about the
statutory framework, applies equally to this matter
and I incorporate those
paragraphs into these reasons.
Prejudice to the applicant if the review proceedings are not adjourned
respondent submits, in summary, that the Supreme Court proceedings are
irrelevant to the review application, because the respondent
is not a party to
the Supreme Court proceedings. However, although the respondent is not a party
to those proceedings, and will
not be bound by it, if the outcome of those
proceedings was that the Building Commissioner had no jurisdiction to make a BRO
the applicant to replace the pipes in that case, the practical effect
will be that none of the BROs made by the Building Commissioner
relating to the
pipes would be enforced.
to [22] above, what is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [42] to
[63], about the applicant's prejudice if the
review proceedings are not
adjourned, applies equally to this matter and I incorporate those paragraphs
into these reasons.
Prejudice to the applicant if the stay is not granted
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [64] and [65] applies equally to
this matter and I incorporate those paragraphs
into these reasons.
BRO requires that the applicant conduct a full re-pipe of the respondent's house
within 6 months of 6 June 2025, that is by 6
December 2025. It is not in
dispute that this goes beyond the work that the applicant has been doing and
says it will continue to
Casotti says in his affidavit that BGC Group has been performing damage repair
where there have been burst pipe events, and ceiling
re-pipes, on a voluntary
basis. Mr Casotti says that the applicant has not performed a full home re-pipe
of the respondent's house.
Mr Bosnich says in his affidavit that a ceiling
re-pipe had been scheduled for late September 2025. On Mr Casotti's evidence,
order to complete the full re-pipe required by the BRO, in addition to the
ceiling re-pipe, the applicant must remove and replace
the remaining pipes in
the laundry, the kitchen/scullery, the guest ensuite, a powder room, two
ensuites, two water closets and a
recess in a living room.
Mr Casotti's evidence, based on re-pipe work the BGC Group has undertaken on six
houses, a complete re-pipe takes 12 to 14 weeks
to complete if the occupiers
move out of their home while the work is being done, and 14 to 16 weeks if they
do not do so. Accordingly,
Mr Casotti says that there is a risk that the
complete re-pipe of the respondent's house will not be complete by 6 December
if the re-pipe work is not commenced by the beginning of September 2025.
That deadline had passed as at the date of the hearing
Accordingly,
on Mr Casotti's evidence, there is a real risk that the required work would not
be completed by 6 December 2025 in any
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [70] to [78] about the
applicant's prejudice if a stay is not granted applies
equally in this matter
and I incorporate those paragraphs into these
Delay in bringing the applications
my view, there was no unreasonable delay by the applicant in bringing the
applications that might weigh against the applications
being granted. On the
evidence before me, the review proceedings were commenced within the statutory
time limit and the applications
were foreshadowed by the applicant with the
respondent very soon thereafter for the purpose of conferral.
Prejudice to the respondent if the stay or adjournment are granted
Potential financial and emotional impacts of delay
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [79] about the applicant's
concession concerning the effect of delay on the
respondents applies equally in
this matter and I incorporate that paragraph into these reasons.
his affidavit of 7 September 2025, the respondent
describes the ongoing detrimental effect of the
repeated burst pipes that have already occurred, and the fear of further burst
He says that he has suffered eight burst pipes over a period of
approximately 3 years, with the first on 21 July 2022 and the latest
2025. The respondent says that the inconvenience he suffers as a result of
each burst pipe is huge.
respondent says that, as a result of his work, it is difficult for him to
arrange to be at home to let tradespeople into the
house to undertake repair
work, resulting in long waiting periods for repairs. He says that the
cycle of patch repairs, being exposed
to damage, such as damp walls, potential
mould, debris, and dust, and the uncertainty of when a full re-pipe will take
taking a huge mental and emotional toll on him. The respondent says
that the value of his home and the ability to sell it has been
affected, as the unresolved issues with the pipes must be disclosed to a
potential buyer.
is no challenge to this evidence. I accept that the respondent has suffered
adverse financial consequences as a result of
the ongoing problem of pipes
also accept that there is an emotional toll where a person has experienced
numerous burst pipes and has to live with the risk that
other pipes may burst at
any time, and with the disruption to their normal lives in a house where
building work is repeatedly being
undertaken to replace burst pipes. I accept
that there may be health risks associated with the flooding that results from a
pipe event.
I do not accept that the stay will cause the respondent hardship that cannot be
alleviated to some extent by the terms of
the stay. Whilst the history suggests
that there is a risk of a burst pipe event before a hearing, if the BRO is
stayed, that may
addition, I also find that the work that will be done in late
September 2025 will reduce the risk to some extent, given the replacement
of a portion of the allegedly defective pipes.
financial risks attached to delay, if not the emotional consequences, may be
alleviated to some extent by conditioning the order
for a stay on the provision
of an undertaking as to damages. As I have said, the applicant did not oppose
providing such an undertaking.
Length of the delay
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [88] to [90] about the delay if
a stay is ordered but not an adjournment, and
in [91] to [94] about the delay if
there is a stay and an adjournment, applies equally in this matter and I
incorporate those paragraphs
into these reasons.
Prospects of success in the review proceedings
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [95] to [98] about the
applicant's prospects of success in the review proceedings
applies equally in
this matter, save that the reference at [96] of those reasons to 'the applicant
and Ventura' should be read as
'the applicant and J-Corp'. With that amendment,
I incorporate those paragraphs into these reasons.
Public Interest considerations
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [99] to [102] about the public
interest considerations applies equally in this
matter, and I incorporate those
paragraphs into these reasons.
Impact on the Tribunal's objectives
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [103] to [105] about the impact
of the applications on the Tribunal's objectives
applies equally in this matter,
and I incorporate those paragraphs into these
Balance of convenience
is said in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [106] to [107] about the balance
of relevant factors, or the balance of convenience,
applies equally in this
matter, and I incorporate those paragraphs into these
Other matters
his written submissions, the respondent's counsel adopted the written
submissions of the first and second respondents in J-Corp
and McCutcheon.
However, it appeared to me that in his oral submissions the respondent did not
join in any reliance on the applications
being an abuse of process as being for
an improper purpose.
to the extent that I am incorrect in that, what is said in the J-Corp and
McCutcheon reasons at [108] to [113] applies equally
in this matter, and I
incorporate those paragraphs into these reasons.
comments made in the J-Corp and McCutcheon reasons at [114] to [117] also apply
equally to this matter, and I incorporate those
paragraphs into these
the reasons referred to above, I have determined that it is desirable to order a
stay of the operation of the BRO subject to
the provision of an undertaking by
the applicant and to dismiss the application for an adjournment of the review
proceedings. I
have also decided it appropriate to make orders programming the
review proceedings to a directions hearing, as set out
orders made on 18 September 2025 were as follows:
