Indigenous Legal Relations in Australia

Indigenous Legal Relations in Australia
discusses how key legal
issues faced by Indigenous peoples are informed by the social and historical
context of the dispossession,
discrimination and disadvantage experienced by
Indigenous peoples.
Written by legal academics and aimed primarily at law students, the book is a
good overview of a range of legal issues that affect
Indigenous peoples. The
legal issues are bound together by common themes of history, racial
discrimination, and the political struggle
for recognition and
self-determination. In some cases, international human rights principles and
comparative law are used to discuss
alternative approaches to legal
The book is divided into four parts. The first part, ‘Law of the
Colonisers’, examines how the past legal and social treatment
Indigenous peoples has affected their legal rights today. Past injustices such
as the forced removal of children, stolen wages
and assimilation are linked to
current issues relating to poverty, criminalisation and child welfare.
The second part, ‘Equality before the Law: Criminalisation’,
examines the disproportionate impact that the justice system
has on Indigenous
peoples. The authors present a holistic overview of Indigenous peoples’
system, including discretions in policing,
bail and sentencing, to interrogate why Indigenous peoples are grossly
overrepresented
in Australian prisons and the criminal justice system.
The importance of land rights to Indigenous peoples, and the political and
legal struggles for recognition of those rights, are discussed
in part three,
‘Law, Land and Culture’. This part also includes a chapter by
Robynne Quiggin, which discusses the inadequacy
of western intellectual property
law to protect Indigenous cultural heritage.
Finally, part four, ‘Law, Rights and Governance’, provides an
overview of Commonwealth racial discrimination legislation
and also discusses
the drive for constitutional change and a treaty (or progressive treaty making)
to recognise Indigenous peoples,
and the use of these rights to deliver
practical outcomes. This section also takes a critical look at the issue of
self-determination
in the context of Indigenous peoples’ aspiration for
self-governance and decision-making power.
Indigenous Legal Relations in Australia
is designed to be an
introduction to the legal issues facing Indigenous Australians. Each chapter
includes discussion questions and
case studies to provoke critical refl ection
on options for social and legal change. However, it is not a ‘cases and
textbook. Rather,
Indigenous Legal Relations in Australia
identifi es and discusses issues in a general way without necessarily
providing a comprehensive overview, or extracts, of the law.
While the case
studies note the content and signifi cance of a number of court cases, students
will need to look to primary sources
such as legislation, case law and
parliamentary and historical documents to gain a comprehensive understanding of
particular legal
In this context, the main strength of
Indigenous Legal Relations in
is its examination of the way that law and legal institutions form
part of the broader social experiences that shape the everyday
Indigenous peoples. So, for example, the discussion of the overrepresentation of
Indigenous children in child welfare not
only covers family and welfare laws,
but looks at the effects of paternalism and interference by the state with
Indigenous families,
the intergenerational effects of the stolen generations and
poverty, and considers the importance of Indigenous selfdetermination
community development in solving these issues. This approach informs the view
that the law alone cannot solve the legal and social
problems facing Indigenous
peoples, and that perhaps the best answers to these issues lie beyond the legal
The book has been written during what is hoped to be a time of change in
Indigenous legal relations in Australia. The federal Government’s
to the stolen generations, endorsement of the United Nations
Declaration of
the Rights of Indigenous People
and consultation on a new representative
body perhaps signal a renewed interest in relationships between Indigenous and
non-Indigenous
Australians. However,
Indigenous Legal Relations in Australia
highlights the legal and social issues that continue to contribute to
Indigenous disadvantage in Australia. As such it is a good introduction
anyone wishing to understand the legal, social and historical factors that infl
uence Indigenous peoples’ experiences of
the law in Australia.
