REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
reasons for decision should be read with, and use the same abbreviations as in,
our decision made on 1 September 2025:
Health Care Complaints Commission v
[2025] NSWCATOD 119
(the principal
parties have applied to vary order (4) of the principal decision but are in
disagreement as to the specific terms of the costs
order. The Commission
contends that costs should be agreed or assessed (the HCCC costs application).
Mr Solari contends that a gross
sum costs order with a 100% discount should be
made (the Solari costs application).
have decided to make a gross sum costs order of $8,000.00 in favour of the
Commission.
The history of the proceedings since 1 September
17 September 2025, the Commission lodged the following documents:
(1) costs submissions dated 17 September 2025 (the HCCC costs submissions);
(2) short form itemised estimate of costs (the HCCC costs estimate).
21 September 2025, Mr Solari lodged the following documents:
(1) costs submissions dated 21 September 2025 (the Solari costs submissions);
(2) documents issued by the Australian Taxation Office in respect of Mr Solari
(the ATO records):
(a) Notice of assessment for the year ended 30 June 2023;
(b) Notice of assessment for the year ended 30 June 2024;
(c) 2024-2025 tax return;
(3) HCCC website screenshot.
29 September 2025, the Commission lodged its costs submissions in reply dated 29
September 2025 (the HCCC costs submissions in
following issues arise for determination:
(1) whether a hearing of the HCCC costs application and the Solari costs
application should be dispensed with;
(2) what should be the specific terms of the costs order.
Whether a hearing of the HCCC costs application and the Solari costs
application should be dispensed with
Commission does not object to a hearing of the HCCC costs application and the
Solari costs application being dispensed with. Mr
Solari has not addressed this
are satisfied that the issues for determination in relation to the HCCC costs
application and the Solari costs application can
be adequately determined in the
absence of the parties by considering their evidence and written submissions.
Accordingly, we have
decided pursuant to s 50(2) of the NCAT Act to make an
order dispensing with a hearing in relation to these
applications.
What should be the specific terms of the costs
Introduction
considering this issue, it is appropriate to set out the applicable legal
principles, and summarise the evidence and the submissions
The applicable legal principles
New South Wales Court of Appeal in
Manariti Plumbing Pty Ltd v Universal
Property Group Pty Ltd (No 2)
[2025] NSWCA 185
[30]-[38] (Free JA with McHugh JA at [1] and Ball JA at [2] agreeing) recently
summarised the relevant principles governing an
application for a gross sum
costs order:
Harrison v Schipp
(2002) 54 NSWLR 738
[2002] NSWCA 213
Harrison v Schipp
) at [21] Giles JA described the power to make a gross
sum costs order instead of ordering assessed costs, conferred at that time
52A r 6(2)(c) of the
Supreme Court Rules 1970
(NSW), as being unconfined and apt
to be exercised whenever the circumstances warrant its exercise. The same
approach applies to
s 98(4) of the
Civil Procedure Act
Hamod v State
of New South Wales
[2011] NSWCA 375
) at [813].
[31] One of the circumstances that has been recognised as potentially warranting
the making of a gross sum costs order is where the
assessment of costs would be
protracted and expensive, and in particular if it appears that the party obliged
to pay the costs would
not be able to meet a liability to pay the order likely
to result from the assessment:
Harrison v Schipp
at [21]. That was the
situation in
Harrison v Schipp
, where at [30] Giles JA found that Mrs
Schipp “should not have to spend a lot more money which she will not
in order to obtain the costs payable to her.
[32] Even where the element of impecuniosity is not present, the length and/or
complexity of the underlying proceedings and the associated
likelihood of a
lengthy and complex assessment are material considerations that can favour a
gross sum costs order. A contested costs
assessment in a matter with these
characteristics is likely to involve expense, delay and aggravation of the kind
that it is desirable
to avoid by making a gross sum costs order: Hamod at [817].
Where there is a lack of proportionality between the complexity and cost
assessment process and the amount at stake, that is also a factor favouring the
making of a gross sum order:
Zepinic v Chateau Constructions (Aust) Ltd (No
[2014] NSWCA 99
Zepinic v Chateau Constructions
) at [28], [31]. A
related circumstance warranting such an order is where the total costs of
litigation will become even more disproportionate
if the costs are referred for
assessment:
Bechara (t/as Bechara and Company) v Bates
[2016] NSWCA 294
Bechara v Bates
at [816] the Court held that in determining whether the sum
sought is appropriate and meets these standards, factors that merit particular
consideration include the relative responsibility of the parties for the costs
incurred, the degree of any disproportion between
the issue litigated and the
costs claimed, the complexity of proceedings in relation to their costs and the
capacity of the unsuccessful
party to satisfy any costs liability.
[34] A court entertaining an application for a gross sum costs order is not
required to undertake a detailed examination of the kind
that would be
appropriate to a taxation or formal costs assessment:
[823]. To require something akin to a formal costs assessment would defeat the
purpose of the gross sum costs order:
Bechara v Bates
[35] A corollary of that principle is that a broad brush approach is necessarily
Bechara v Bates
Zepinic v Chateau Constructions
at [31]. In
Harrison v Schipp
at [22] Giles JA referred with approval to
the proposition that a gross sum “can only be fixed broadly having regard
information before the Court” (quoting
Beach Petroleum NL v
Johnson (No 2)
(1995) 57 FCR 119
Beach Petroleum
) at 124) and that
the rule contemplates a court adopting a “much broader brush than would be
applied on taxation”:
Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc
[36] At the same time, as Giles JA emphasised in the same passage in
at [22], the approach taken to estimating costs must be
“logical, fair and reasonable” and the power should be exercised
“only when the Court considers that it can do so fairly between the
parties, and that includes sufficient confidence in arriving
at an appropriate
sum on the materials available”: citing
Beach Petroleum
Wentworth v Wentworth
(Court of Appeal, 21 February 1996, unreported).
The need for the Court to have confidence in arriving at an appropriate sum was
emphasised in
Colquhoun v District Court of New South Wales (No 2)
, where the deficiencies in the material in that regard were
Baychek v Baychek
[2010] NSWSC 987
Ball J referred to the
principle that the Court is entitled to take a broad brush approach provided
that the approach is logical,
fair and reasonable, and observed that it is
implicit in this that the gross sum “bear a reasonable relationship to the
costs of the party making the application, and to the costs that that
party might reasonably be expected to recover on assessment.
That means, among
other things, that there must be a reasonable evidentiary basis for the order
the court makes”. To similar
Tim Barr Pty Ltd v Narui Gold
Coast Pty Ltd
[2011] NSWSC 11
, Barrett J at [21] held that a decision as to
what is a sufficiently reliable calculation or estimate of an appropriate costs
“will depend to a large extent on reaching some kind of view of what
the outcome on assessment might be”.
[38] As a matter of practice, courts typically apply a discount in assessing
costs on a gross sum basis:
at [814]. Indeed, in
Chateau Constructions
at [38] the Court described this as the invariable
practice of the courts when calculating a gross sum costs order. That may
“an impressionistic discount of the costs actually incurred or
estimated, in order to take into account the contingencies that
relevant in any formal costs assessment”:
at [820]. Such an
approach tends to minimise the risk of a gross sum costs order creating
unfairness by allowing for the recovery
of costs in excess of the amount that
would in fact have been recovered if the matter had proceeded to costs
assessment.”
New South Wales Court of Appeal in
Salmon v Albarran (No 2)
[2025] NSWCA
Salmon (No 2)
) at [28]-[29 (Ward ACJ; Leeming and Ball JJA) in
assessing the amount of a gross sum costs order applied discounts of 25% and 10%
to professional costs and disbursements respectively reflecting that the
assessment of party/party costs is less than a full indemnity.
Elias v Smidt (No 3)
[2025] NSWSC 1062
Elias (No 3)
[71]-[140], Leeming JA carried out his own assessment as to whether the claimed
professional costs and disbursements were fair
and reasonable in determining the
amount of a gross sum costs order. Relevantly, His Honour:
(1) had regard to the
Costs Assessment Rules Committee Guidelines
24 October 2023 (
Costs Guidelines
) in assessing counsel’s fees and
professional costs for paralegals, and at ]92] relevantly said:
“... the Guidelines are not binding, but there is merit in treating them
as a general rule, departure from which requires identifying
some good reason.
(2) reduced the fees claimed for disbursements for counsel on the basis that
the claimed fees were not fair and reasonable: [72]-[98];
(3) applied a 15% discount to the amount allowed for disbursements:
[97]-[104];
(4) reduced the fees claimed for professional costs for paralegals on the
basis that the claimed fees were not fair and reasonable:
[105]-[119];
(5) applied a 15% discount to the amount allowed for professional costs:
Costs Guidelines
relevantly contain the following provisions:
(1) time incurred by legal service providers performing professional work should
be allowed within the specified ranges: Senior associate
(5 years plus) (hourly)
- $360 - $600; Paralegals (hourly) - $135 - $300: [6];
(2) office overhead costs such as photocopying, printing, document production,
scanning, electronic lodgement, telephone, emails
and faxes will generally be
covered by the hourly rates of the lawyers. Such costs should generally not be
allowed either as a professional
cost or as a disbursement, when undertaken in
house by the lawyer or law practice: [7];
(3) research time may be allowed, only to the extent that such work is
reasonable for the prudent preparation and conduct of the
matter: [9].
Attorney General's rates for legal representation
(the NSWAG rates) are
rates set by the New South Wales Attorney General payable to legal
representatives (solicitors, junior and
senior counsel) engaged by and on behalf
of Government departments and agencies. They have included the following
(1) Solicitor: $315.40 per hour with a daily maximum of $3,154 plus GST from 1
August 2024  to 31 July 2025;
(2) Solicitor: $326.44 per hour with a daily maximum of $3,264 plus GST from 1
August 2025  to 31 July 2026.
E Dal Pont in
Law of Costs
(5th ed, 2021, Lexis Nexis) has relevantly set
out the following principles with respect to the allowances on costs
quantification
between party and party:
(1) as to pre-proceedings costs at [17.03]:
“The costs of a party allowable as between party and party are not
necessarily limited to costs incurred once the writ is issued.
The test remains,
on a party and party basis, whether the costs are necessary or proper for the
attainment of justice. Circumstances
may arise where costs meeting this
description are incurred prior to the proceedings being formally instituted.
...” (footnote
(2) as to a solicitor attending counsel in court at [17.16]:
“To determine whether or not a solicitor should be allowed a fee for
attending counsel in court for the purposes of giving
instructions, the test to
be applied is the same as that applied in deciding whether fees for two (or
more) counsel should be allowed:
would a reasonable and prudent but not
over-cautious litigant, in all the circumstances, engage the services of an
instructing solicitor,
notwithstanding the cost? ...” (footnote omitted)
The evidence of the parties
The Commission
HCCC costs estimate sets out a total amount of $22,585.05 comprising itemised
costs totalling $22,182.65 and disbursements totalling
$402.50 for photocopying
at 20 cents per page. The document records a chronological list of work
undertaken. For each item of work,
the date, the activity, the hourly rate, the
time in minutes, the officer undertaking the work and the amount are specified
as follows:
(1) Ms Panizzutti, Legal Officer, $401.00, 2703 minutes; $18,065.05;
(2) E Maguire, Legal Manager, $494.00, 150 minutes, $1,235.00;
(3) B Butt (who is recorded in the HCCC application as the Acting Director of
Proceedings), $616.00, 114 minutes, $1,170.40;
(4) M Rogers, Legal Officer, $401.00; 12 minutes, $80.20;
(5) B Mulqueeney, Paralegal, $192.00, 150 minutes, $480.00;
(6) L Dolva O’Dea, Paralegal, $192.00, 360 minutes, $1,152.00.
HCCC costs estimate relevantly records:
(1) costs totalling $10,926.65 before the commencement of the proceedings.
Between 23 January 2025 and 17 March 2025, 1193 minutes
(10 hours 51 minutes)
were spent on analysing the sufficiency evidence and drawing the Complaint in
correspondence between Ms Panizzutti,
E Maguire and B Butt, and advising and
obtaining instructions from the Council and the Health Professional Councils
Authority (HPCA),
which is an administrative agency of the NSW Ministry of
Health and provides administrative, clinical and legal advice and services
the 15 health professional councils of New South Wales with respect to the
commencement of the proceedings. Between 27 March 2025
and 8 April 2025, 342
minutes (5 hours 43 minutes) were spent on Ms Panizzutti preparing five versions
of the HCCC application and
the review of the first four by E Maguire;
(2) costs totalling $18,279.55 for items of work taking 2,727 minutes (45 hours
27 minutes) were undertaken between 1 August 2024
and 31 July 2025. Of
this work 2,577 minutes (42 hours 55 minutes) were undertaken by lawyers and 150
minutes (2 hours 30 minutes)
were undertaken by a paralegal. Some of these costs
related to correspondence with the Council and HPCA, and relating to internal
clerical support. Further, the amount of $1,152.00 is claimed for professional
costs for L Dolva O’Dea being the total of:
(a) $96.00 (30 minutes x $192.00) for attending a conference with Ms Panizzutti
to discuss preparation on 31 July 2025;
(b) $249.60 (78 minutes x $192.00) for conducting preparations on 1 August
(c) $518.40 (162 minutes x $192.00) for instructing Ms Panizzutti at the hearing
on 4 August 2025;
(d) $288.00 (90 minutes x $192.00) for conducting legal research on 11 September
(3) costs totalling $3,903.10 for items of work taking 762 minutes (12 hours 42
minutes) were undertaken since 1 August 2025 .
Of this work 402 minutes (6
hours 42 minutes) were undertaken by lawyers and 360 minutes (6 hours) were
undertaken by a paralegal.
ATO records indicate that Mr Solari had a taxable income of $32, $8 and $4 in
the financial year ended 30 June 2023, 30 June 2024
and 30 June 2025
respectively.
HCCC website screenshot records the denial of access to Mr Solari to the HCCC
hardship application.
The submissions of the parties
The HCCC costs submissions
Commission in the HCCC costs submissions has submitted:
(1) it has referred to
203 Castlereagh Street
at [45] where the Appeal
Panel relevantly said:
“... Tribunal Members should not generally be encouraged to carry out the
work of costs assessors by making fixed sum costs
orders. The circumstances most
likely to arise in the Tribunal where it might be appropriate for the Tribunal
itself to assess costs
will usually be where the costs are very modest and the
assessment is simple. This might be the case, for example, where the parties
self-represented and not entitled to recover work done in preparing their case,
and the only recoverable costs are the filing
fee and other small,
non-contentious out of pocket expenses, see generally: Gino Dal Pont,
(3rd ed, 2013) at 171-174.”
(2) its costs, while reasonable, cannot be described as “very
modest”, particularly in the context of Mr Solari stating
that he has no
capacity to pay any costs order;
(3) it has referred to
Health Care Complaints Commission v Le (No 2)
[2021] NSWCATOD 122
) where the Tribunal found that the
inability of a respondent to satisfy a costs order does not warrant the making
of an order in
fixed sum. In that case the Tribunal refused to order costs in a
fixed sum, and instead ordered costs as agreed or assessed, where
circumstances of the respondent, who had been unemployed for several years and
was burdened by significant debt, are analogous
to those alleged by Mr
(4) the Tribunal may exercise its discretion to make a gross sum costs order
in circumstances where it is necessary to resolve an
intractable dispute between
the parties as to the appropriate costs, or where the process of agreeing or
assessing costs may be expected
to be a protracted and costly process. Beyond
Mr Solari’s contention that he cannot afford to meet a costs order, there
no other evidence that the parties will be unable to resolve the issue, such
that the intervention of the Tribunal is warranted;
(5) while the ‘broad brush’ approach to be taken by the Tribunal
in assessing costs may involve the application of some
discount to the estimate
submitted, the Tribunal must be mindful that it does not apply an arbitrary
‘fail safe’ discount
which causes unfair prejudice, citing
v State of New South Wales
[2011] NSWCA 375
(6) in the event the Tribunal determines to make a gross sum order, any
discount should be limited to 10%. Accordingly, the appropriate
sum would be
$20,326.55.
The Solari costs submissions
Solari in the Solari costs submissions has submitted:
(1) he cites eight examples in the HCCC costs estimate in which the costs appear
to be excessive by reason of exceeding the NSWAG
rates in which the rate for a
solicitor is $315.40 per hour. Further, there should be no charge for
paralegals;
(2) it is not clear how much if any discount would be afforded through the
Commission’s hardship policy, since the policy suggests
that deferral of
payments and payment arrangements are the main offerings with the option of a
waiver only being granted in exceptional
circumstances;
(3) his case is distinguishable from in
where the respondent
was only restricted from reapplying for registration for 18 months of the order
and is much younger than him,
meaning that the respondent’s opportunity to
and likelihood of re-entering the workforce is much higher. In contrast, his
age, time non-practicing as a radiographer, lack of skills outside of
radiography, sexual touching criminal record and inability
to obtain a working
with children check, his prospects of employment in the future are extremely
limited and unlikely. He has no
income as disclosed in the ATO records, no
savings, no investments and his family home is mortgaged. He is unable to claim
because his wife earns a wage. His only other asset is a 2009 Subaru
Impreza hatchback valued at approximately $3000;
(4) the total barrister hours billed for his criminal proceedings were 43.2
hours with five court appearances, suggesting excessive
billing of hours by the
Commission. Further, the Commission has also used rates in excess of the NSWAG
rates. An appropriate amount
would be less than $10,000.00 given most of the
legal work used by the Commission was done for the criminal proceedings. He
a 100% discount to be applied, given that he has no legal means of
paying the costs.
The HCCC costs submissions in reply
Commission in the HCCC costs submissions in reply has submitted:
(1) it remains willing to engage in costs negotiations with Mr Solari, should
the Tribunal make an order awarding costs as agreed
or assessed. Such
negotiations would include consideration of any application made by Mr Solari
pursuant to its hardship policy;
(2) Mr Solari’s submission that the costs claimed by the Commission are
excessive is misconceived and without merit;
(3) the NSWAG rates apply to private firms engaged to act on behalf of
government agencies, and have no relevance to the costing
of legal work
performed by government solicitors such as those employed by the Commission;
(4) Mr Solari seeks a gross sum costs order with a discount of 100% applied to
the costs claimed by the Commission. Such an order
would in effect be an order
that the parties bear their own costs. In the absence of disentitling conduct,
the making of such an
order would be so unreasonable as to constitute an error
Consideration
have decided to exercise the discretion to vary order (4) of the principal
decision to make a gross sum costs order for the following
(1) the relevant principles are authoritatively expounded in
[30]-[38]. We do not accept that the example in the last sentence of
Castlereagh Street
at [45] is an exhaustive statement of the circumstances
in which a gross sum costs order may be made;
(2) we do not accept that the exercise of the discretion of the Tribunal is not
making a gross sum costs order in
provides any assistance in
the exercise of the discretion in these proceedings. The personal circumstances
of the respondent in
differ from those of Mr Solari in the
respects outlined by him in the Solari costs submissions;
(3) in view of the challenge by Mr Solari to eight examples in the HCCC costs
estimate in which the costs appear to be excessive,
it is likely that the
assessment of costs would be protracted and expensive, which was recognised as a
relevant circumstance in
(4) in view of the information provided by Mr Solari as to his financial
position which in part is supported by the ATO records,
it is likely that he
would not be able to meet a liability to pay the order likely to result from an
assessment, which was recognised
as a relevant circumstance in
(5) it will avoid the expense, delay and aggravation of a contested costs
assessment, which was recognised as a desirable outcome
(6) the possible application of the Commission’s hardship policy is a
neutral factor as it can apply equally to costs determined
by an assessment and
costs specified by a gross sum costs order;
(7) the HCCC costs estimate has sufficient detail to provide a reasonable
evidentiary basis for us to have sufficient confidence
in arriving at an
appropriate sum that is logical, fair and reasonable, and bears a reasonable
relationship to the actual costs of
the Commission, and to the costs that the
Commission might reasonably be expected to recover on assessment, which was
as the appropriate approach in
at [36]-[37].
accept the accuracy of the HCCC costs estimate as to the date, activity, time
and officer for each item, noting the dispute as
to the appropriate hourly
with the approach of Leeming JA in
Elias (No 3)
at [71]-[140], we have
decided to carry out our own assessment of whether the professional costs and
disbursements claimed in the
HCCC costs estimate are fair and reasonable in
determining the amount of a gross sum costs order. We make the following
(1) we have treated the NSWAG rates as a general rule in assessing the quantum
of the professional costs for lawyers. We do not accept
that the fact that the
Commission uses employed lawyers rather than using external lawyers should mean
that rates greater than allowed
under the NSWAG rates and find that the rates
for professional costs for lawyers in the HCCC costs estimate are not fair and
reasonable.
Accordingly, using the NSWAG rates, we have reduced the amount of
$20,550.65 claimed for professional costs for lawyers to $16,537.85
(a) $14,350.70 (45.5 hours x $315.40) for work between 1 August 2024  and
31 July 2025. Of this amount $8,752.35 (27.75 hours
x $315.40) is attributable
to pre-proceedings costs and $5,598.35 (17.75 hours x $315.40) is attributable
to proceedings costs;
(b) $2,187.15 (6.7 hours x $326.44) for work since 1 August 2025;
(2) as the NSWAG rates do not have a category for work undertaken by paralegals,
we have treated the
Costs Guidelines
as an appropriate guide in assessing
the quantum of the professional costs for paralegals. We accept that the rate of
$192.00 per
hour for work undertaken by paralegals is fair and reasonable. It
follows that we have not altered the amount of $1,632.00 (8.5 hours
claimed for professional costs for paralegals;
(3) we have rounded pre-proceedings costs of $8,121.55 to $8,100. Having regard
to the principles in
Law of Costs
at [17.03], we do not accept that many
of the items would be allowed on a costs assessment on a party and party basis
such as the
communications with the Council and the HPCA who are analogous to a
client, and the preparation and review of more than one version
of the HCCC
application. Adopting a broad-brush approach, we have allowed $2,700.00, being
one third of the reduced pre-proceedings
(4) we do not consider that the amount of $1,152.00 claimed for professional
costs for L Dolva O’Dea as set out above is fair
and reasonable. A
paralegal is not analogous to a solicitor preparing for a hearing, instructing
counsel or conducting legal research.
Further, having regard to the principles
Law of Costs
at [17.16], we do not accept that Ms Panizzutti required
an instructor at the hearing. It follows that we have reduced the amount
$1,632.00 claimed for paralegals by $1,152.00 to $480.00;
(5) we have rounded the reduced amount of $6,229.15 for proceedings professional
costs for lawyers to $6,200. Consistent with
Salmon (No 2)
applied a discount of 25% resulting in the amount of $4,650.00 ($6,200.00 x
