In the matter of an application by Kester Miranda for leave to issue or file [2025] HCASJ 41 (10 November 2025)
HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA
IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY KESTER MIRANDA FOR LEAVE TO ISSUE OR
[2025] HCASJ 41
Date of Judgment: 10 November 2025
application filed on 28 October 2025 for a suppression order is

The applicant is unrepresented
On 4 June 2025, consequential on reasons for judgment published on the same
I ordered that the
applicant's ex parte application filed on 12 May 2025 for leave to issue or file
a writ of summons dated 17 April
2025 is dismissed.
application filed on 28 October 2025, the applicant seeks an order for the
suppression of those reasons for judgment. The affidavit
in support asserts
that: (1) the
(Cth) gives the applicant "total
reasons for judgment would
breach the applicant's privacy including his
(extremely rare) name and that he had $380,000; (3) the applicant's
identity is irrelevant
to the "core of [the] matter"; (4) revealing the
applicant's identity would defeat the Court's fair administration of justice and
place the applicant into the limelight to his great "personal detriment";
(5) the applicant needs his identity never to be mentioned
outlets; and (6) the applicant has a genuine concern for his safety given
the profit made by five of the "Big Banks", so
suppressing the applicant's
identity is "crucial".
Judiciary Act 1903
(Cth) regulates the Court's making of a
suppression order or non-publication order. By
in "deciding whether
to make a suppression order or non-publication order, the High Court must take
into account that a primary objective
of the administration of justice is to
safeguard the public interest in open justice". The power to make a suppression
order or non-publication
s 77RE(1)(a)
, includes the power to
prohibit or restrict the publication or other disclosure of information tending
to reveal the identity of
or otherwise concerning any party to a proceeding.
That power, however, is available only on one of the grounds in
While those grounds include that "the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to
the proper administration of justice" in
s 77RF(1)(a)
and "the order is
necessary to protect the safety of any person" in
s 77RF(1)(c)
, no part of
the affidavit of the applicant in support of the application for a suppression
or non-publication order provides evidence
capable of establishing the existence
of these grounds. The affidavit does not rise above mere assertions by the
applicant or mere
expressions of his own desire not to be identified in the
judgment. This is insufficient to justify the making of a suppression or
non-publication order given that by
, in "deciding whether to make a
suppression order or non-publication order, the High Court must take into
account that a primary
objective of the administration of justice is to
safeguard the public interest in open justice".
