Petroff, Clinton v Queensland Harness Racing
[2002] QRAA 21
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield -
This is an appeal by Mr Clinton John Petroff against the
severity of sentence imposed by the Queensland Harness Racing Board Stewards
concerning a breach of Rule 231 of the Rules of Harness Racing which
“231. A person shall not assault, abuse or otherwise interfere improperly
with anyone employed, engaged or participating in
the harness racing industry or
otherwise having a connection with it.”
against the Appellant related to the abusive and threatening statements made by
the Appellant against Mr Lance Moore which
occurred in the drivers’ room
at Albion Park Raceway on Tuesday 8 October 2002.
At the time Mr Moore
was an employee of the Albion Park Harness Racing Club. Mr Moore has been an
employee for in excess of 18 years
and his position on 8 October 2002 was that
as the Staff Supervisor in addition to the driver of the Stewards cars and
in the acceptance office.
At the raceway there is a room
available for use by licensees and during the races on 8 October 2002 Mr Moore
was in that drivers’
room when Mr Clinton Petroff entered the room. Mr
Moore questioned Mr Petroff as to whether he was working or driving at the
that day and Mr Petroff’s response was that he wasn’t. Mr
Moore then spoke to Mr Petroff about the room only being for
drivers and
licensees when Mr Clinton Petroff became agitated and aggressive to Mr Moore
stating that he would “head butt”
Mr Moore. Mr Petroff said that
the same thing happened to him on Saturday night being in the room and felt that
officials were trying
to “pick” on him and then stated that he was
in fact driving at the raceway later than night.
The manner in which Mr
Clinton Petroff made the threats were to such an extent that Mr Moore referred
the matter to the Stewards.
It is noted that Mr Moore stated that although he
had a number of altercations during the 18 or 19 years working at the raceway
this was the first time he was not prepared to let it go and reported it to the
The attendant at the drivers’ room that day was Mr Ray
Campbell who witnessed the incident. At the Stewards inquiry Mr Campbell
confirmed to the Stewards his concerns as to the threats made by Mr Clinton
The reason why Mr Moore questioned Mr Clinton Petroff as to him
being in attendance at the drivers’ room is that there had been
over previous weeks of persons using the room who were not entitled to do so.
Mr Clinton Petroff was not known to Mr Moore.
Mr Clinton Petroff is the
holder of a C Grade Licence and in addition to having a drive in a trial that
night was assisting his brother
who was driving at the raceway.
the Stewards inquiry and at this Appeal Mr Clinton Petroff tried to justify his
actions by stating that he was not aware that
Mr Moore was an employee and
stated that by asking him the questions Mr Moore tried to intimidate him. Mr
Chris Petroff Snr submitted
that the room attendant knew who Mr Clinton Petroff
was and he should have been the one to question him and not Mr Moore. Mr Chris
Petroff Snr further submitted that his son would not have carried out his
threats as that is not the sort of person he is.
The Authority does not
accept the Appellant’s explanation can be considered justification for his
actions. His behaviour can
only be considered as disgraceful.
Appellant is a young man who comes from a family well known in the industry and
has not had any prior breaches of the rules.
A breach of Rule 231 in these
circumstances is a serious matter and the Authority agrees with the decision of
the Stewards to impose
a period of disqualification. The Authority however,
believes that in all the circumstances and particularly in view of Mr
age that three months is not the appropriate period and a term
of approximately two months would be more appropriate.
After considering
the initial time the Appellant was disqualified and the period during which he
had a stay the Authority imposes
a disqualification on Mr Clinton John Petroff
to midnight 28 December 2002.
The Authority further orders that the
Appeal deposit fee be forfeited.
