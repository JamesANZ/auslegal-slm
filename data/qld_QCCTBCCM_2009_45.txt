aREASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
applicant was successful on an application for adjustment of the contribution
schedule lot entitlements and the interest schedule
lot entitlements of the Kiwi
Court Community Title Scheme 12925. In my decision of 10 September 2009 I
indicated that I was minded
to order the respondent pay the applicant’s
costs limited to his expenditure on expert witnesses but that I invited the
to provide submissions as to an alternative order.
Submissions
have now been provided by both sides.
applicant’s submissions and attached invoices indicate that he has spent
the following amounts on expert witnesses:
(1) $1,220.00
paid in respect of the evidence of Mr Barrie Green, surveyor;
(2) $1,100.00
paid in respect of the evidence of Mr Nathan Cobb, valuer; and
(3) $3,175.00
paid in respect of the evidence of Mr Craig Brennan, QBS Strata Management.
applicant has also incurred witness-related expenses of $45.00 in the service of
subpoenas and $147.00 in witness expense fees
(3 amounts of $49.00 each).
applicant has also incurred out-of-pocket fees relating to travel made necessary
by the litigation, an attendance on Hynes Lawyers
for their assistance in
identifying appropriate experts and other sundry expenses for,
, photocopying.
respondent has submitted that:
witness’ fees are too high;
applicant did not give the respondent notice of the application and, had he done
so, the matter might have resolved and the
costs could have been avoided;
respondent’s representatives (other lot owners) had contributed a great
deal of their own time and expenditure in responding
to the application.
I mentioned in my decision, costs in a case such as this are governed by
sections 70
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act
main purpose of division 7 of the Act is to have the parties pay their own costs
unless the interests of justice require otherwise.
remain of the view that it is in the interests of justice that the
applicant’s costs relating to the experts should be paid
respondent; I am not, however, of the view that the interests of justice require
the respondent pay the applicant’s
travel costs and outlays including his
attendance on Hynes Lawyers.
have no evidence before me to the effect that the quantum of the expert’s
fees is outside the usual range of fees for such
services. In the absence of any
evidence to the contrary, I accept that they are reasonable and that they have
been incurred by the
Accordingly,
I will allow the applicant $5,495.00 for the cost of the experts and $192.00 for
witness expenses (service of the subpoenas
and witness conduct money).
to the respondent’s third point, whilst I acknowledge that serving on the
committee of a body corporate may be a “thankless
task”, the fact
remains that the applicant has succeeded in his application quite convincingly:
the contribution lot entitlement
schedule has required that he pay a very great
deal more than should have been the case for 12 years. Further, whilst no
of the application may have been given, it was hard fought by the
respondent all the way to trial even in the face of expert evidence.
There is no
evidence before me which suggests that the respondent would have adopted a more
conciliatory approach to the dispute
had it been raised prior to the filing of
the application. It is not to the point that the applicant “
he was signing up for
” when he bought the lot in the Community Titles
Scheme: the Act provides a mechanism for the change of the lot entitlement
schedules and the applicant has successfully taken advantage of those
provisions.
applicant has asked that I order that the payment be made otherwise than from
the sinking fund. His point is that he has contributed
considerably more than
he should have done for 12 years and does not wish to have his funds utilised,
in essence, to pay a costs
order in his favour. I have some sympathy for this
view. On the other hand, the applicant could have brought this application
in time. It is not, however, necessary to reconcile these views as I do
not have the power on this application under either the
Body Corporate and
Community Management Act
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal
to order that a payment be made by a body corporate from a
particular fund or to cause a special levy to be raised.
the reasons herein, I order that the respondent pay the costs of the applicant
in the amount of $5,687.00 by 4:00pm on 6 November
