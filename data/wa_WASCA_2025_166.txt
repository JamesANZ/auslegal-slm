referred to in decision(s):
OF THE COURT
is an urgent appeal from a decision of the President of the Children's Court of
Western Australia concerning the proper application
of s 401A and
s 401B of the
Criminal Code
to a juvenile offender.
These provisions set out the circumstances in which a person convicted of an
offence of home burglary is
to be regarded as a 'repeat offender', and sentenced
on that basis.
respondent has conceded the appeal. We consider that the concession is correct
for the reasons set out below.
appellant was born in January 2008. Consequently, he turned 16 years
old in January 2024. He will reach the age of 18 years
each of 22, 24 and 25 December 2023, at a time when the appellant was
below the age of 16 years old, he committed three separate
offences of
aggravated home burglary. Further, after the appellant turned 16 years
old, he committed three more offences of aggravated
on each of 17 and 18 May 2024, and 7 June 2024. The appellant
was subsequently convicted of these and other offences. On 25 July
he was sentenced to a three‑month Juvenile Conditional Release Order
). He was sentenced individually
on each charge of aggravated home burglary, to three months' detention. Each
sentence was subject
to the same JCRO, which expired on 24 October
the JCRO had expired, between 15 November and 2 December 2024, the
appellant committed a further offence of home burglary with
intent (described by
the primary judge as the '
'). This was Matter CC PE 6968 of 2024. He was
16 years and 9 or 10 months old at the time when he committed the
offence. He was
sentenced for this offence on 25 July 2025. He was also
sentenced on that day for an offence of aggravated armed robbery, which
on 4 February 2025 (the '

sentencing the appellant for the Balga Burglary, the primary judge concluded
that the appellant was a 'repeat offender' within
the meaning of s 401B(1)
That provision is in the following terms:
For the purposes of this Chapter, a person who is being sentenced for a home
burglary (the
if the person has at
least 3 relevant convictions. (original emphasis)
primary judge reached this conclusion as he considered that all six of the
appellant's previous convictions were 'relevant convictions'.
consequence of the primary judge's conclusion was that the appellant had to be
sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment
or detention in accordance
with s 401(4)(b)(ii) of the
which provides as follows:
Subject to section 401A(4), where a person convicted under this section of
a home burglary (the
current offence

relevant conviction the court sentencing the person
for the current offence

(ii) if the person had not reached 18 years of age when the current offence
was committed, notwithstanding the
Offenders Act 1994
section 46(5a)
, must impose either
(I) a term of imprisonment of at least 12 months; or
(II) a term of detention under the
Offenders Act 1994
of at least
as the court thinks fit. (original
appeal turns upon whether the primary judge was correct in concluding that the
appellant had six 'relevant convictions'. The
appellant contends that he only
had two 'relevant convictions'. The answer to this dispute lies in the
application of s 401A.
'Relevant convictions'
meaning of 'relevant conviction' is elaborated in s 401A of the
Criminal Code
. This provides a
definition of 'relevant conviction' for the purposes of Chapter XXXIX of
Criminal Code
. Subject to certain
matters in s 401A(2) ‑ (4), the definition appears in
definition is divided into two parts. Paragraph (a) addresses where the
31 October 2015. In those circumstances, a person's conviction for home
burglary is a 'relevant conviction' if either:
(i) it is the person's first conviction for a home burglary (the person's
first relevant
(ii) it is the person's first conviction for a home burglary committed after the
date on which the person's first relevant conviction
was recorded (the person's
second relevant
(iii) it is a conviction for a home burglary committed after the date on which
the person's second relevant conviction was recorded.
Section 401A(1)(b)
operates where the home burglary was committed on or after the commencement day.
In those circumstances, a person's
conviction for a home burglary is a 'relevant
conviction' if:
(i) the person is an adult offender with respect to the home burglary; or
(ii) the person is a juvenile offender with respect to the home burglary and
(I) it is the person's first conviction for a home burglary; or
(II) at the time of the home burglary, the person already had a conviction for a
previous home burglary;
(iii) at the time of the home burglary the person had not reached 16 years of
age, and either -
(I) it is the person's first conviction for a home burglary (the person's
first relevant
(II) it is the person's first conviction for a home burglary committed after the
date on which the person's first relevant conviction
was recorded (the person's
second relevant
(III) it is a conviction for a home burglary committed after the date on which
the person's second relevant conviction was recorded.
is helpful for the present case to also mention the matters referred to in
s 401A(2) and s 401A(3).
Section 401A(2)
provides that a conviction includes a finding or admission of guilt that leads
to a punishment being imposed on,
or an order being made in respect of, the
person, whether or not a conviction was recorded: s 401A(2)(a). It also
provides that a
conviction does not include a conviction that has been set aside
or quashed: s 401A(2)(b).
401A(3) prescribes that, for the purposes of s 401A, convictions for two or
more home burglaries committed on the same day
on or after the commencement day,
are to be treated as a single conviction.
this case, the appellant at all material times was a juvenile offender. The
date of 31 October
2015. For the first three convictions of home
sentenced on 25 July 2024, the appellant had not yet reached 16 years
of age. For the next three
convictions
sentenced on 25 July 2024, and for the conviction of the Balga
as entered on 25 July 2025, the appellant had reached the age of
16 years old.
Consequently,
in ascertaining if any of the appellant's convictions for the first three
convictions of aggravated home burglary sentenced
on 25 July 2024 are
'relevant convictions', the relevant part of s 401A is
s 401A(1)(b)(iii). For ease of reference, we will call
convictions A, B and C in the chronological order in which the home
burglaries occurred. For the remaining four home burglary
convictions, the
relevant part of s 401A is s 401A(1)(b)(ii). For ease of reference,
we will call these convictions D, E, F and
G, again in the chronological
order in which the burglaries occurred. Conviction G refers to the
conviction for the Balga Burglary.
Conviction A
is evidently within the terms of s 401A(1)(b)(iii)(I). It is the
appellant's first conviction for a home burglary.
Therefore, it is the
appellant's 'first relevant conviction'.
Convictions B
and C are not within s 401A(1)(b)(iii)(II). They are not convictions
for a home burglary 'committed after the date
on which the [appellant's] first
relevant conviction was recorded'. The home burglaries which are the subject of
convictions B and
C were committed in December 2023. These burglaries were
before the date on which the appellant's first relevant conviction was
being 25 July 2024. Consequently, convictions B and C are not 'relevant
convictions'.
Convictions
D, E and F need to be assessed by reference to s 401A(1)(b)(ii), as they
occurred at a time when the appellant had reached
16 years old.
Conviction D
is not the appellant's first for a home burglary. Hence,
s 401A(1)(b)(ii)(I) does not apply. At the time of the fourth
burglary the subject of conviction D, in May 2024, the appellant did not
already have a conviction for a previous home burglary.
Convictions A to F
were not entered until 25 July 2024. Therefore, s 401A(1)(b)(ii)(II)
does not apply. It follows that conviction
D is not a 'relevant
conviction'. The same reasoning applies equally to convictions E and
Conviction G,
the Balga Burglary, relates to a home burglary between 15 November and
2 December 2024. At that time, the appellant
had six convictions for home
burglaries, as a result of the convictions and sentencing on 25 July 2024,
one of which was a 'relevant
conviction', being conviction A. It follows that
conviction G, is the appellant's second 'relevant conviction' due to
s 401A(1)(b)(ii)(II).
this analysis, based upon the plain wording of s 401A(1), the appellant
only has two 'relevant convictions'. That is not sufficient
to qualify the
appellant as a 'repeat offender' within s 401B(1), as the statute requires
that a person must have three 'relevant
convictions'. If adopted, this
reasoning means that s 401(4) does not apply so as to make the appellant
liable to be sentenced to
detention or imprisonment for 12 months.
result should not be regarded as an unintended consequence of ill‑chosen
statutory words. The analysis which has been
set out above discloses that the
legislature made the existence of a subsequent 'relevant conviction' for a
juvenile, or a person
who had not reached the age of 16 years, dependent
upon whether the offender had been convicted for a home burglary prior to
re‑offending.
Hence, where a juvenile offender commits several home
burglaries prior to any conviction, only the first conviction will count as
'strike' for the purposes of becoming a 'repeat offender'.
purpose of this legislative choice is easily discerned. A juvenile offender
should have the benefit of a warning from being
convicted before further home
burglary offences count as 'relevant offences' for the purposes of making the
juvenile offender a 'repeat
offender' and thereby subject to increased
punishment.
is consistent with giving express statutory effect, at least where juvenile
offenders are concerned, to a particular principle
of statutory interpretation
laid down by Sir Edward Coke. That principle was described by Mazza JA in
The essence of Coke's principle of statutory interpretation is that before a
person is subject to an increased penalty for a second
or subsequent offence,
that person must have both committed and been convicted of the previous offence
or offences and those offences
and convictions must have occurred on separate
days. The apparent rationale behind the principle is that, before an offender
exposed to a higher penalty for repeat offending, he or she must be lawfully
convicted of the prior offending and properly warned
of the consequences of such
Parliament did not apply Coke's principle to home burglaries committed by adult
offenders after the commencement day:
s 401A(1)(b)(i). However, that
legislative decision does not detract from the obvious purpose of applying the
principle to juvenile
offenders, and offenders less than 16 years of age.
This category of offenders are less mature than adults, and therefore, in
Parliament's
view as discerned from an ordinary and natural reading of
s 401A(1)(b), deserve the opportunity to be warned before becoming
categorised
as 'repeat offenders' and subject to increased penalties.
these reasons, we consider that the primary judge erred in sentencing the
appellant as a repeat offender. In general terms,
and without detracting from
applying the particular legislative provisions as explained above, the specific
error made by the primary
judge was failing to accept that second or subsequent
convictions for home burglaries are only 'relevant convictions' for a juvenile
offender, or for an offender under 16 years of age, if the offender has
previously been convicted of a home burglary before committing
a new offence.
In this case, only the Balga Burglary occurred after the appellant had been
convicted for any of the previous home
burglaries.
have two further observations to add about the proper approach to s 401A.
in an appropriate case, it may be necessary to consider the interaction of s
401A of the
Criminal Code
Young Offenders Act 1994
whether the 'shield' provided by
means that a conviction may not be
considered for the purposes of assessing whether it is a 'relevant conviction'
for the purposes
of s 401A. That question does not arise in this case.
we think that some of the difficulties in this case may have been caused by the
learned President's attempts to paraphrase
the effect of s 401A, rather than
applying the actual words of s 401A according to their plain meaning. We think
that it was likely
a distraction to paraphrase portions of s 401A in
TT v The State of Western
and to then restate that paraphrasing in the
our view, the appeal should be allowed and the appellant should be resentenced
according to law. As well, leave should be granted
for an extension of time
within which to appeal.
that the appellant is already in detention for a number of matters, we consider
that it would be appropriate for him to be
resentenced by the learned President
of the Children's Court who is aware of all of the matters and has sentenced him
on the other
offences. The appellant pleaded guilty to, and was sentenced to,
numerous charges on 25 July 2025. This included being sentenced
of 1 month for the Pharmacy Robbery, cumulative upon the term of
12 months as a repeat offender for the Balga Burglary.
That overall
sentence of 13 months was as a result of totality considerations.
Consequently, the error which means that the mandatory
sentence of
12 months should be set aside, may also affect whether the cumulative
sentence of 1 month for the Pharmacy Robbery is
still appropriate.
propose to set aside both the sentence in respect of the Pharmacy Robbery as
well as the sentence for the Balga Burglary, so that
both may be resentenced
together. This course will allow the learned President to apply overall
totality considerations and to ensure
that all relevant points are taken into
