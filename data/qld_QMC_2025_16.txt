SOLICITORS:
Hall & Wilcox for the Plaintiff
No Appearance for the Defendant
INTRODUCTION
[1] The plaintiff has commenced proceedings claiming damages
arising out of a motor vehicle accident.
[2] The claim and statement of
claim plead a claim by the plaintiff only against the defendant David Grant
Hallaran. The plaintiff’s
application seeks to ‘amend the
claim’ to add a second defendant Jamie Martin Beveridge.
APPLICATION
[3] The plaintiff applies for the following orders:
(1) Pursuant to r 375 and 377 of the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
(Qld) (UCPR) the claim and statement of claim be amended to add a second
defendant Jamie Martin Beveridge.
(2) There be no order as to costs.
[4] The plaintiff as applicant proposes a decision without oral

(b) Was accompanied by a
draft order and written submissions in

defendant, the application would otherwise appear compliant.
plaintiff had purported to file a request for consent orders (with the consent
of the defendant) but that was properly refused
by the registrar by notice of
refusal dated 8 November 2024 consistent with the relevant practice
[8] The plaintiff’s
submissions and the affidavit in support also refer to the contended
‘consent’ of the defendant.
The relief sought by the plaintiff is
not such that the parties can consent and joinder or addition of a party
requires the exercise
of a discretion.
APPLICANT’S MATERIAL
[9] The applicant’s material consists of
the following.
(1) Application seeking amendment of claim and statement of
claim filed 13 March 2025.
(2) Affidavit of ILL Murray (law graduate) filed
13 March 2025.
(3) Submissions by applicant filed 13 March 2025.
[10] Interestingly, the plaintiff has also purported to have filed a
proposed amended claim on 13 March 2025.
[11] The amended claim is purported
to be endorsed by the plaintiff’s solicitors as having been amended
pursuant to r 378 –
THE RELEVANT RULE
plaintiff’s application and the submissions propound that the application
is made pursuant to r 375 and 377 –
[13] Relevantly, r 375
(1) At any stage of a proceeding, the court may allow or direct a
party to amend a claim, anything written on a claim, a pleading,
an application,
or any other document in a proceeding in the way and on the conditions the court
considers appropriate.
[14] The power to amend includes the power to give
leave to make an amendment even if the effect of the amendment would be to
a cause of action arising after the proceeding was
[15] Here in seeking to amend by
adding a defendant, the plaintiff is effectively seeking leave to make an
amendment – the effect
of which would be to include a cause of action
arising after the proceeding was started, that is, a cause of action against
[16] As the claim is an originating
r 377 – UCPR is applicable.
relevantly provides:
(1) An originating process may not be
amended except –
(c) Otherwise – with leave of the court.
[18] The circumstances where an originating process may be amended with leave of
the registrar only relate to amendment of a technical
matter or where the
originating process has not been served.
plaintiff therefore requires leave of the court to amend the claim (as an
originating process) and the purported amendment and
filing of an amended claim
on 13 March 2025 by the plaintiff is incompetent.
[19] The effect of the
amendment sought by the plaintiff is to add or join another person as a party in
the proceeding.
[20] Notwithstanding that the plaintiff’s application
is to amend its claim and statement of claim and is stated to be under
r77, since the plaintiff also seeks to add further parties to the proceeding r
69 including substituting or removing a
party and r 70 (procedure for inclusion
of a party) are also relevant.
(1) The court may at any stage of a proceeding order that –
(b) Any of the following persons be included as a party –
(i) A person whose presence before the court is necessary to enable the
court to adjudicate effectually and completely on all matters
in dispute in the
proceeding.
(ii) A person whose presence before the court would be
desirable, just and convenient to enable the court to adjudicate effectually
completely on all matters in dispute connected with the proceeding.
[22] In considering the plaintiff’s application to ‘amend,’
effectively to add as second defendant Jamie Martin
Beveridge the requirements
of r 69 and r 70 must be applied.
[23] The plaintiff’s submissions are
silent as to the requirements of r 69 and it is unable to be ascertained under
of r 69(1)(b) the plaintiff relies. Those two limbs relevantly are
that the person may be included as a party:
- Whose presence before the
court is necessary to enable the court to adjudicate... or
- Whose presence
before the court would be desirable, just, and convenient to enable the court to
adjudicate.
[24] In either eventuality because joinder r 69(1) requires the
exercise of a discretion, the merits of the case proposed to be advanced
joinder is a relevant consideration.
[25] On an application for joinder, the applicant should support its
application by providing the court with a draft of the pleading
proposes to file if the order is granted. This allows the applicant to show that
there is a good cause of action against
the proposed defendant and that the
application satisfies rules for
provides for
procedure for inclusion of a party. Relevantly, r 70 provides:
the court orders otherwise, an application to include a person as defendant or
respondent must be served on all existing
parties and on the person.
CONSIDERATION
[27] The plaintiff’s application to amend has been
prefaced on solely relying on the court’s power pursuant to r 375 and
it involves amendment of an originating process (a claim) requiring the courts
leave pursuant to r 377.
[28] The plaintiff’s submissions and the
supporting affidavit material do not address any of the consideration or
requirements
of r 69, specifically by providing any evidentiary foundation in
respect of the involvement or proposed cause of action against the
proposed to be joined, Jamie Martin Beveridge.
[29] The plaintiff has
provided a proposed amended statement of claim, but the affidavit material (the
purported evidentiary foundation)
does not provide any evidence in respect of
the matters sought to be advanced in the proposed amended pleading.
plaintiff it appears has also failed to serve a copy of the application upon the
person sought to be joined, Jamie Martin
[31] The requirements of
r 70(2) are proscriptive, unless on application by the plaintiff orders were
made otherwise, this present
application must be served on the person sought to
[32] The plaintiff’s application must fail both as a result
of noncompliance with r 70(2) but also as there is no material permitting
assessment of the merits of the proposed case to be advanced after joinder.
DISPOSITION
[33] The plaintiff’s application must fail and be

(1) The plaintiff’s application be
