Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family
Assistance Alignment and Other Measures) Bill 2016
This bill seeks to amend various Acts relating to family assistance and social

certain merits review decisions relating to family tax benefit

Tax Benefit supplements; and
• correct an unintended consequence of amendments that were made to

House of Representatives on 20 October 2016
The committee dealt with this bill in
Alert Digest No. 8 of 2016
Minister responded to the committee’s comments in a letter received on
21 November 2016. A copy of the letter is attached
to this report.
Alert Digest No. 8 of 2016 - extract
Trespass on personal rights and
liberties—retrospective
application
Schedule 1, items
Schedule 1 proposes amendments to how the ‘date of effect rules’
A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act
operate for certain merits review decisions that create new or
increased entitlements to family tax benefit. The amendments to the
of effect rules’ will apply in relation to review decisions made on or
after the commencement of the bill, however,
the application provisions in items
13–15 mean that where the decision under review relates to the payment of
family tax benefit
by instalment in the 2012-13 or later income years, the new
rules provided for in these amendments will be taken to apply.
The statement of compatibility (at p. 2) states that ‘most of the
amendments have retrospective effect from the 2012-13 income
however ‘individuals have been aware of these notification timeframes for
a number of years already’ and
‘there have been extensive
communications of the requirements; the individuals have been advised of these
timeframes regularly
in letters sent directly to them, and on government
The committee notes this explanation, however, persons are generally entitled
rely on the law as it actually is, rather than as they
are advised by government
departments as to what the law may be. To assist the committee in considering
the appropriateness of the
retrospective application of these amendments, the
committee seeks the Minister’s advice as to the number of persons likely
to be affected by these amendments and the extent of detriment they are likely
to suffer as a result of the retrospective application
of these new provisions.
Minister's response - extract
In response to this request, I can advise that no one is expected to suffer
detriment as a result of the amendments. This is because
the Department of Human
Services has been implementing the approach since 2012-13, consistent with
government policy, so recipients
who did not notify that they were not required
to lodge tax returns for these years on time, have not been paid Family Tax
supplements and top-ups. As such, they do not stand to lose any amount
as a result of the amendments.
The amendments simply seek to strengthen and clarify the current provisions
to put their interpretation beyond doubt. It became necessary
to strengthen and
clarify the current provisions following a decision by the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal where the Department’s
interpretation was questioned. The
amendments will ensure that the intended operation of the law is clear to all
oversight and review
Committee response
The committee thanks the Minister for this response.
The committee notes the Minister’s advice that ‘no one is
expected to suffer detriment as a result of the amendments’
as the bill
puts on a statutory footing the policy adopted by the Department of Human
Services since 2012-13. As such, the Minister
advised that ‘no one stands
to lose any amount as a result of the amendment’. The committee also notes
the Minister’s
advice that the amendments became necessary
‘following a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where the
Department’s
interpretation was questioned’.
Based on the information available to the committee, it is still not clear
that no one will suffer any detriment as a result of the
bill. While the
Minister indicates that no one will lose any amount that they have already been
paid, it is unclear whether anyone
who had an entitlement to merits review under
the AAT’s interpretation of the law will now lose that entitlement. If so,
is unclear how many people could be affected by the bill and the extent of
any detriment they may suffer.
The committee reiterates its earlier comments that people are generally
entitled to rely on the law as it actually is, rather than
as they are advised
by government departments as to what the law may be.
The committee draws its scrutiny concerns to the attention of Senators and
leaves the appropriateness of the retrospective application
in items 13-15 to
the consideration of the Senate as a whole.
