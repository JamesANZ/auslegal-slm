REASONS FOR DECISION
If the reader seeks an illustration of
how the uncritical use of adjournments can produce unfair outcomes, then read
The tenant had a long history with the
Department going back to 1982. She has been a chronic rent defaulter over those
years. In the
period of 4 years prior to the commencement of the present lease
on 24 April 2000 the Tribunal had made orders on 8 occasions that
the tenant pay
her rent and bring her rent arrears up to date. The tenancy of the tenant had
twice been terminated in this period
and the Department had entered a new
tenancy with the tenant, the last of which commenced on 24 April 2000 at a rent
of $150.00.
There was no fixed term of the lease and no bond in accordance with
the usual Department practice.
On 15 February 2001 the Department lodged
an application with the Tribunal for an order for possession of the premises.
The application
was based on a Notice of Termination dated 5 January 2001 for
rental arrears. The Notice was served by post and required possession
February 2001. At the time of service of the Notice by mail the tenant was more
than 2 weeks in arrears of rent and by the time
the Department filed its
application the tenant was said to be $540.01 in arrears.
The matter was listed for hearing at
Campbelltown on 15 March 2001. Ms Roe appeared for the Department and the tenant
appeared in
person. The matter was adjourned for the tenant to complete a new
rental subsidy form.
The matter was then re-listed at
Campbelltown on 19 April 2001 at which time Ms Roe and the tenant both again
appeared. The Department
had recalculated the tenant’s rental arrears
based on her new rental subsidy form which for the first time disclosed the full
extent of her household income. The tenant’s rental arrears were in fact
$2518.47. Evidence was given by both Ms Roe and the
tenant to a differently
constituted Tribunal. The matter was not sound recorded and the present Tribunal
relies upon the notes of
the Tribunal member presiding on 19 April 2001. The
Department outlined the history of its relationship to the tenant per paragraph
2 above and submitted that they had shown leniency over those years but to no
effect. Mr Roe gave further evidence that the premises
had been badly treated by
the tenant. Finally the Department contended that the tenant had not given a
truthful disclose of the true
extent of her household income in the past and it
was only when a proper disclosure occurred following the last hearing before the
Tribunal that it became apparent that the tenant was in fact in greater rent
arrears then the Department had previously realised.
The tenant gave evidence that she was a
person of aboriginal descent, working full time and earning about $24,000pa. She
had an adult
son living with her who was receiving workers compensation of about
$264pw but who did not contribute towards the rent because of
a drug addiction.
The tenant argued that she had other debts to pay and had not been in a position
to pay her full rent for some
The presiding member made an order for
possession to take effect on 18 May 2001 and an order that the rent arrears of
$2518.47 be
paid on or before that date.
On 15 May 2001 the Department took the
unusual course of making an application under section 63
Residential Tribunal
for a re-hearing of its successful application for possession. The
section 63 application indicated that the Department "has been
directed by the
Aboriginal Housing Office to reach a new agreement with Mrs Bamblett The
application did not indicate the basis on
which the Department formed the view
that it was obliged to act at the direction of the AHO.
A letter from the AHO accompanied the
application which outlined an agreement between the AHO and the tenant under
which the tenant
would make certain lump sum payments towards the arrears and
submit new evidence of household income.
On 16 April 2001 a member of the
Tribunal granted the section 63 application.
The rehearing of the Department’s
original application for possession was listed for hearing at Campbelltown on 6
before a differently constituted Tribunal. The tenant did not appear
on that occasion. She faxed the Tribunal requesting an adjournment
on the basis
that she had lost her handbag in a snatch and run episode on 26 May 2001. The
tenant did not indicate how this fact
related to her inability to attend the
Tribunal on 6 June 2001 but the fax concluded with the statement that she was
required to
attend a training session at work on 6 June 2001 and that commitment
would need to take priority over the Tribunal hearing.
It would seem that the Department did
not oppose the adjournment which was granted notwithstanding the inadequate
basis for the application
by the tenant.
The matter was next listed at
Campbelltown on 25 June 2001. Mr Roe appeared for the Department but the tenant
did not appear. The
tenant’s arrears were then $2512.81 indicating that,
notwithstanding the agreement with the AHO, there had been no payment
towards the rent arrears by the Department from the tenant. The Tribunal did not
make an order for possession but rather
made an order that the tenant pay the
arrears by one lump sum of $950 followed by fortnightly payments of $89.70 in
addition to usual
On 12 July 2001 the Department requested
that the Tribunal re-list the matter as the tenant had not complied with the
order of 25
June 2001. The matter was listed at Campbelltown on 6 August 2001.
On 1 August the tenant faxed the Tribunal requesting an adjournment.
accompanied by a medical certificate dated 31 July 2001 from a Dr John Mathews
which was illegible except that it said that
the tenant was unfit for work. The
certificate contained a date by which the tenant would be fit for work but that
date is overwritten
on the certificate. The original writing appears to read "3
.8.01" but is overwritten to read "10.8.01". The certificate is wholly
unconvincing for want of any legible detail and the substantial uncertainty as
to whether it is in its original form. In her fax
the tenant also said that she
had recently come by some money and would be paying the sum owed in 10 days. The
Tribunal again adjourned
the hearing. It is noted that the form completed by the
Tribunal member referred to the tenant suffering chicken
The matter was re-listed again on 22
August 2001 and again the tenant did not appear. This time the tenant faxed the
Tribunal claiming
her mother had died. The Department advised that the arrears
were at that time $3271.91. Thus notwithstanding the agreement with
promise contained in her fax of 1 August upon which a further adjournment had
previously been granted, the various orders
of the Tribunal and the fact the
order for possession of 16 April 2001 was still stayed pending re-hearing of the
application, the tenant had made no further payment of any kind
since 16 July 2001 and the arrears had continued to grow. Notwithstanding
the above, the Tribunal again adjourned the matter.
The matter was then re-listed at
Campbelltown on 5 September 2001, on which occasion the tenant did appear. The
tenant still had not
made any payment at all since 16 July and her arrears were
then $3502.21. The tenant asserted that she was expecting an inheritance
near future which would permit her to pay the arrears. No evidence was produced
to substantiate this claim. The Tribunal again
adjourned the matter, by consent,
with an order that the tenant pay the whole of the sum owing by 14 Sept 2001
being $4150.00. The
tenant shortly thereafter presented the Department with a
dishonoured cheque.
Needless to say the tenant did not make
the payment, rather she presented a debtors petition to the Insolvency and
Trustee Service
of Australia and entered bankruptcy on 20 September 2001. A copy
of the order from ITSA was provided to the Tribunal. In response
to this order
the Department adjusted the tenant’s rent arrears to remove any monies
owing prior to 20 September 2001.
The matter was next listed before the
Tribunal on 26 September 2001. Again the tenant did not appear. The tenant faxed
the Tribunal
Regardless of our previous
discussions and arrangements I have been declared bankrupt and accepted on 20
September 2001...
On 26 September 2001 the Department
advised the Tribunal that after adjustment of the rent ledger for the
pre-bankruptcy arrears,
the tenant was no longer in arrears of rent. Accordingly
the Tribunal made a further order that the tenant pay her rent on time and
it up to date.
The tenant did not comply with the
Tribunal's orders and on 16 November 2001 the Department again requested
re-listing of their application
on the basis that the tenant had again defaulted
on her rent. The matter was listed for hearing at Campbelltown on 29 November
before the presently constituted Tribunal. The tenant did not attend and
sent a fax asserting that she would pay the sum owing before
the date of the
hearing. On the day of the hearing the sum was not paid and the Department
sought possession based on the outstanding
arrears of $871.50 accruing post
bankruptcy. The tenant had in fact made no payment at all since 18 October 2001
and this was a mere
$50.00. The tenant had made only one other modest payment
since 16 July 2001.
The Tribunal had no hesitation in making
the order for possession effective 13 December 2001 in lieu of the previous
orders of 19
April 2001 in respect of which the section 63 application related.
This approach was adopted rather then dismissing the section 63
application and
leaving the original order for possession in force because the sheer delay,
caused wholly, and in the Tribunal’s
view, quite deliberately by the
tenant, was such that the date for possession contained in the orders of 19
April 2001 had passed.
The present Tribunal formed the view
that the tenant had been accorded extraordinary leniency and multiplicity of
opportunities to
remedy her defaults. At all time she was in full time
employment. No reason of any substance was advanced by the tenant as to why
had so consistent defaulted over so many years, but more particularly during the
term of this lease. The Tribunal formed the
view that the tenant’s
behaviour was deliberate and not deserving any further leniency. The Tribunal
delivered its decision
on the day which was conveyed to the parties by notice of
3 December 2001.
One matter of some importance was raised
by the Department during the hearing concerning the status of the rent arrears
the bankruptcy. The Department took the view that the bankruptcy
expunged the debt owing prior to bankruptcy such that the extent
tenant’s arrears of rent post bankruptcy is only that accruing since the
date of the bankruptcy. The Tribunal took the
view that bankruptcy did not
expunge the debt per se but rather acted as a bar to the enforcement of the debt
which could only then
be satisfied through the trustee in bankruptcy
RT 01/08766
. Section 58(3)
Bankruptcy Act 1966
58 Vesting of property upon bankruptcy
(3) Except as provided by
, after a debtor
has become a bankrupt, it is not competent for a creditor:
(a) to enforce
any remedy against the person or the property of the bankrupt in respect of a
provable debt; or
(b) except with the leave of the Court and on such terms
as the Court thinks fit, to commence any legal proceeding in respect of
provable debt or take any fresh step in such a proceeding.
There is a fundamental difference
between expunging a debt and simply barring the enforcement of the debt. That
difference is material
in the present case.
Section 57(3)
Residential
Tenancies Act 1987
permits a Notice of Termination to be served where
rent has remained unpaid in breach of the agreement for not less than 14
days before the notice was given
." The fact that the tenant enters
bankruptcy and the rent arrears then owing are not directly enforceable against
the tenant in no
way negates the fact that rent has remained unpaid in breach of
the agreement for 14 days or more. Thus the existence of the rent
arrears caught
in the bankruptcy remains relevant to
section 57(3).
It is also relevant to
section 64(2)(c)
which requires the Tribunal to consider all the circumstances
of the case when determining whether to make an order for possession.
fact that a large rent arrears accruing over a long period can only be enforced
through the trustee in bankruptcy in no
way diminishes its relevance to the
consideration of whether an order for possession should be
