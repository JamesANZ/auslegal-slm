REASONS FOR DECISION
APPLICATION NO: SCS
APPLICATION
10 September 2013 the applicant filed an application seeking a penalty be
imposed on the Owners Corporation SP 30368 pursuant to
section 202
of the Act on
the grounds that the Owners Corporation failed to carry out the work in orders
that were made by an Adjudicator on
8 January 2013 (SCS
8 January 2013 the Adjudicator made the following orders:
respondent Owners Corporation Strata Plan 30368 shall on or before 31 March 2013
organise the undertaking and completion of the
following work in a proper and
workmanlike manner:
repair/replace
the 2 security lights at the back of the building;
out any work necessary to ensure that the building complies with fire safety
requirements:
the clothes line;
up the back yard and remove all garden/tree waste;
e) paint and refurbish all balcony railings and balustrades:
and refurbish all garage doors.”
applicant states that;
“(a) has been complied with:
(b) was not complied with until December 2013:
(c) has been complied with;
(d) has not been complied with;
(e) was not commenced until May 2013 and is now complete; and
(f) has not been complied with. ”
respondent submits that the orders have been complied with.
applicant has provided the following submission in relation to the work which he
states has not been complied with.
TIDY UP THE BACK YARD AND
REMOVE ALL GARDEN/TREE WASTE
applicant has provided a large range and number of photographs which he claims
show that the respondent has not complied with
the order to tidy up the back
yard and remove all garden tree waste.
respondent has provided a copy of a quotation dated 26 February 2013 from MZ
Property Maintenance for special garden cleaning
of the common property,
together with a tax invoice from MZ Property dated 20 March 2013 for the
cleaning of the back yard on 19
March 2013. The respondent has also provided
evidence from the members of the Executive Committee of the Owners Corporation
that the work was carried out by MZ Property in a proper and
workmanlike manner.
was given by the applicant that he was clearly dissatisfied with the work that
was done by MZ Property. The applicant sought
to rely on a number of photographs
to show that the backyard had not been tidied and that the garden and tree waste
had not been
photographs can sometimes be considered as evidence, it is difficult for the
Tribunal relying on a series of photographs to
make findings. The Tribunal has
considered the photographs provided by the applicant, and is not satisfied on
the basis of those
photographs that the Owners Corporation has failed to comply
with the orders of the Adjudicator to tidy the garden and remove the
applicant became animated during the hearing and was very frustrated by what he
sees as the lack of the Owners Corporation
to tidy the garden to his
satisfaction. He was clearly distressed by weeds in the garden and what he
considered to be the untidy
appearance of the garden. Cleanliness and tidiness
are often subjective issues and people may have very differing views regarding
what is tidy and clean. The Tribunal places itself in the shoes of a reasonable
person in determining the issue. The Tribunal has
considered the photographs
provided by the applicant together with the evidence provided by the respondent
and the Tribunal finds
that the respondent has complied with the orders of the
Adjudicator made on 8 January 2013 to tidy up the back yard and remove all
garden tree waste. Whilst the garden may have not been tidied up to the
satisfaction of the applicant this is not a reason to make
a finding that the
order has not been complied with. The applicant has submitted that the invoice
that was paid by the Owners Corporation
to MZ Property should not have been
paid, as in the applicant’s opinion the work was not done satisfactorily.
The Tribunal
finds that the executive committee all examined the work and were
satisfied that the work was done in a proper and workmanlike manner
invoice was paid. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Owners Corporation have
taken reasonable steps to comply with that
order made by the Adjudicator.
PAINT AND REFURBISH ALL GARAGE DOORS
applicant has given evidence that the Owners Corporation have failed to paint
and refurbish all garage doors.
respondent concedes that this work has not been done. The respondent maintains
that the applicant mislead the Adjudicator when
he gave his evidence for
consideration by the Adjudicator. The Owners Corporation state that the
photographs provided by the applicant
were misleading and did not represent the
condition of all of the garage doors. The Owners Corporation were not given an
opportunity
to respond to that evidence as the photographs were submitted late
by the applicant. The solicitor appearing for the applicant made
submissions
that whilst the Owners Corporation could not cavil with the orders made by the
Adjudicator as they did not appeal the
orders, the state of the doors should be
taken into consideration in deciding whether to impose a penalty. The Owners
Corporation
are aware that they must comply with the orders of the Adjudicator
and will do so in due course. Whilst the Tribunal accepts that
not all of the
doors need to be replaced immediately, the Owners Corporation should give
consideration to voting on a motion to have
a schedule in place to replace the
garage doors over a period of time, with the ones most need of replacement to be
done first.
DELAY IN COMPLETION OF ORDERS
Tribunal has considered the delay in the completion of some of the orders. Valid
and reasonable reasons have been put forward
by the Owners Corporation for the
delay in some of the orders being carried out. The Tribunal is satisfied that
the orders of the
Adjudicator were acted upon immediately and some delay to
complete the works was due to reasonable circumstances.
Tribunal must be satisfied on balance that it is appropriate to impose a
penalty. The Tribunal is satisfied that there are mitigating
circumstances that
caused some delay in complying with the orders. The Tribunal is satisfied that
five of the six orders have now
been complied with. Submissions have been made
by the Owners Corporation that consideration should be given to the condition of
of the garage doors and that not all need to be replaced, before a penalty
is imposed. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Owners
Corporation has a clear
understanding of its obligations under
the circumstances the Tribunal is not satisfied at the present time it is
appropriate to impost a penalty.
