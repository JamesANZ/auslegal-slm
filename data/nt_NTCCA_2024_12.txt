REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered on 27 November 2024)
September 2024, the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of negligently causing
serious harm contrary to s 174E of the
Criminal Code 1983
sentencing Judge imposed a sentence of two years and eight months, suspended
after eight months, with an operational period
of two years from the date of
applicant applied for leave to appeal against that sentence on the ground that
the sentence is manifestly excessive.
November 2024, we dismissed the application for leave to appeal on the basis
that the proposed grounds of appeal had no
merit, with reasons to be published.
These are our reasons.
The circumstances of the offending
circumstances of the offending were that the applicant, who was 24 years old,
and his co-offender, who was 20 years old, knew
each other through their work in
the Australian Defence Force.
[6] The victim
was 48 years old and unknown to them.
January 2023, the applicant and co-offender were at a bar where they consumed
alcohol throughout the evening. The victim
was also present. He was intoxicated
and had no memory of the incident due to his level of intoxication and the
injuries he sustained.
[8] At about
11.08 pm, the victim was near the stage area of the bar and both offenders
were dancing near the stage. They tried to
engage with the victim by directing
dance moves at him. The co-offender held out his hand for the victim to shake
but the victim
was in his own world, dancing to the music. He turned away from
both offenders. He then spoke briefly to a friend. The co-offender
walked over
to the victim and his friend, while the applicant lingered nearby watching. The
victim’s friend walked away.
[9] Without
warning, the co-offender pushed the victim forcefully with both hands and he
stumbled backwards. The co-offender walked
towards the victim and again pushed
him forcefully with both hands, causing the victim to again stumble backwards.
The co-offender
took up a fighting stance and before the victim could react, the
co-offender punched the victim to the face. The applicant was standing
metre, watching on. The victim covered his face and the co-offender punched him
twice to the face in quick succession. The
force of the punches pushed the
victim backwards against the wall. The applicant remained standing close to the
co-offender and the
victim and was watching the assault.
[10] While the
co-offender stood over the victim, he turned and handed his sunglasses to the
applicant to look after. The applicant
took the sunglasses and the co-offender
then punched the victim, who was still standing against the wall, in the face
four times.
He then grabbed the victim and pulled him down into a knee strike
directed at the victim’s face. The co-offender motioned for
the victim to
stand up before he punched him in the face again. He continued to stand over the
victim, who was hunched over. The
applicant briefly wandered away to a nearby
[11] The bar
manager noticed the co-offender and the victim and saw that the victim was
bleeding from his nose and mouth. Seeing the
bar manager, the applicant quickly
walked back to the co-offender and the victim. The bar manager took the victim
and walked him
towards the rear bathroom. The offenders followed.
[12] As the
victim was being assisted by the bar manager, the applicant kicked the victim to
the lower half of his body. The co-offender
tried to push past the bar manager
to get to the victim, but the bar manager blocked him and pushed him backwards,
causing the co-offender
to lose his footing. The co-offender grabbed the bar
manager’s arm and pulled him to the edge of the stage. While this was
happening, the applicant punched the victim to the side of his face. The force
of the punch knocked the victim to the ground and
rendered him unconscious
briefly. The bar manager tried to grab the applicant to stop his assault. While
he did so, the co-offender
stood up and stood over the victim, who was awake but
still on the ground. The bar manager and the applicant scuffled before the
manager grabbed him from behind and escorted him from the bar. The co-offender
had other altercations before the bar manager
escorted the applicant out,
followed by the co-offender, with assistance from a security guard. The
co-offender continued to yell
at the bar manager for about two minutes,
challenging him to a fight before the applicant managed to get him to walk
[13] The next
day the co-offender presented himself to Police and following further
investigation, the applicant did the same.
[14] The victim
did not seek medical assistance that night. He woke up the next day in pain with
a swollen jaw. He took pain medication
and went back to sleep. On 20 January
2023, he went to a medical centre for a medical certificate and was directed to
have an x-ray
which revealed a comminuted nasal fracture and three fractures to
his jaw. He was admitted to hospital on 25 January 2023 where he
underwent an
open reduction and internal fixation of his jaw under general anaesthetic. Two
small plates were inserted to permit
the fracture to heal. Without treatment, he
was at risk of permanent jaw malocclusion, which could cause pain and difficulty
The injuries comprised serious harm.
The sentence
applicant had no criminal history and, as the sentencing Judge observed, was
sentenced on the basis that he was a first offender
and this conduct was out of
character for him.
sentencing Judge applied a discount of 25% to reflect the early guilty plea and
remorse, and an additional 8% to reflect
the assistance to authorities which the
applicant had given by presenting himself to Police, and had promised to give by
way of evidence
at the co-offender’s trial. The sentencing Judge
considered that assistance to be limited in circumstances where the entirety
the alleged offending was captured on CCTV and his evidence would likely only go
to any formal issue that may arise in respect
of identification.
[17] As stated
at the outset, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and
eight months, with eight months to serve.
The proposed grounds
applicant has made an application for leave to appeal from the sentence. The
proposed grounds of appeal are:
(a) that, in all the circumstances, the sentence imposed was manifestly
excessive because the applicant was ordered to serve a term
imprisonment; and
(b) that the applicant was denied procedural fairness because although both
parties had submitted that a wholly suspended sentence
was within range, the
sentencing Judge departed from that position in a manner which denied the
applicant the opportunity to make
submissions against the imposition of a
sentence which involved a period of actual imprisonment.
Manifest excess
sentence of two years and eight months, with eight months to serve, is not
manifestly excessive. It is not so far outside
the range of a reasonable
discretionary judgment as to itself bespeak error. The maximum penalty for this
offence is imprisonment
for 10 years. Because the crime of negligently causing
serious harm covers a wide range of circumstances, the sentences imposed for
offence do not disclose either a tariff or a clearly defined sentencing range.
However, a review of comparative sentences shows
that a starting point of five
years is not an unusual disposition, and that offenders are frequently required
to serve 12 months
or more in actual imprisonment before an order suspending
sentence takes effect. We do not accept that the seven comparatives provided
the applicant, which disclosed sentences of imprisonment from 14 months to three
years, are representative of the range of sentences
imposed for this type of
offending, or indicate that a starting point of imprisonment for four years is
so far outside the range
to bespeak error.
[20] In this
matter, the sentencing Judge found that the attack by the applicant and his
co-offender was unprovoked and callous. The
victim was vulnerable and plainly
unable to defend himself. The applicant’s offending comprised, firstly
standing and watching
his co-offender assault the victim, supporting his assault
by his presence and by taking the co-offender’s sunglasses, doing
to stop that assault or assist the victim, kicking the victim when he was
injured and being assisted by the bar manager,
then punching him with such force
that he was rendered briefly unconscious. The sentencing Judge found beyond
reasonable doubt that
the applicant was well aware that his co-offender acted
with intent to hurt the victim and cause him pain, and that, when the applicant
intervened, he also intended to hurt the already injured victim and cause him
pain. The sentencing Judge found the applicant’s
moral culpability for
what happened to the victim to be equal to the co-offender’s culpability,
and of a high order.
[21] His Honour
said this was not a case in which serious harm was caused accidentally but
negligently. Rather, the violence visited
on the victim was intended and the
consequences for the victim were very serious.
[22] We reject
the applicant’s argument that, in circumstances where the applicant was
not charged with involvement in the co-offender’s
offending, the
sentencing Judge gave too much weight to the applicant ‘standing by and
doing nothing’ while his co-offender
assaulted the victim. The applicant
pleaded guilty on the basis of agreed facts which referred to s 43BG of the
Criminal Code
(the provision which provides that,
person who aids or abets the commission of an offence by another person is taken
to have committed the offence), and which identified
the co-offender as
‘the co-accused’. The same charge was brought against both offenders
in circumstances where they both
assaulted the victim by blows to the face and
it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt which blows had caused the
harm sustained by the victim. The offending to which the applicant
pleaded guilty was a course of conduct, committed jointly, which
negligently
caused the serious harm to the victim. The sentencing Judge’s reference to
the applicant’s conduct from the
time the co-offender delivered the first
punch to the victim’s face was proper as it was part of the offending
conduct by the
applicant. To the extent that facts were referred to prior to
that first punch, those facts were relevantly part of the context and
circumstances of the offending.
applicant’s reliance on nine character references was approached with
caution given that the sentencing Judge found
that a number of the referees did
not accurately understand the true nature and seriousness of the offending.
Nevertheless, the sentencing
Judge accepted that the applicant had no criminal
record, had demonstrated an admirable level of community participation, was a
young man, was unlikely to reoffend and was of prior good
sentencing Judge found that the pre-eminent sentencing objectives were
punishment, denunciation and general deterrence. We
respondent’s submission that violence in public places, especially
involving random and unprovoked attacks on vulnerable
victims, is prevalent and
a matter of significant public concern, particularly when that violence is
committed in company and results
in serious harm. Even where an offender has a
compelling subjective case, a term of actual custody should ordinarily be
That is so regardless of the Crown’s attitude as to whether a
custodial sentence is required.
proposed ground of appeal has no
procedural fairness
[26] The second
proposed ground of appeal is that the applicant was denied procedural fairness
because although both parties had submitted
that a wholly suspended sentence was
within range, the sentencing Judge departed from that position in a manner which
applicant the opportunity to make submissions against the imposition
of a sentence which involved a period of actual imprisonment
before the order
suspending sentence took effect.
[27] There is no
basis on which this ground of appeal could properly be pressed. The transcript
of the sentencing proceedings clearly
records the sentencing Judge advising
defence counsel: (a) that he did not necessarily accept the submission that the
co-offender
was the ‘principal
(b) that he agreed
that a suspended sentence was appropriate, but that the real issue was the
‘time to be served before the
sentence is
suspended’;
and (c) that a
wholly suspended sentence was not within
Defence counsel had ample
opportunity to address those matters by way of submission, and took advantage of
that opportunity by addressing
the issue at some
[28] It was not
to the point that the Crown did not oppose an order wholly suspending sentence.
As the sentencing Judge drew to the
prosecutor’s attention during the
course of sentencing submissions, although a period of actual imprisonment would
the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, the other
sentencing purposes of punishment, denunciation and general deterrence
to be given effect.
[29] As counsel
for the applicant ultimately conceded, the decision in
Weir v The Queen
[2011] NSWCCA 123
does not assist the applicant’s cause. That was a case
in which the sentencing judge had indicated it was highly likely that
offender would be sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole
period of 18 months. In light of that indication,
the offender’s counsel
advised the court that it was unnecessary for him to take instructions or make
any further submissions
on the proposed sentence. The sentencing judge
subsequently imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for four years.
[30] The New
South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal found that in those particular
circumstances the sentencing judge was obliged to
grant the offender an
opportunity to make further submissions if he subsequently determined he was
going to impose a longer sentence.
In the present case, the sentencing Judge
clearly put defence counsel on notice that he was considering the imposition of
of actual imprisonment before the order suspending sentence took
effect, gave defence counsel opportunity to make submissions in
relation to that
matter, and defence counsel made those submissions.
[31] Similarly,
the decision in
Wilson v Hill
(unreported, NTSC, Martin CJ, 12 January
1995) also does not assist the applicant. In that case, all of the submissions
and interchange
between counsel and the sentencing Magistrate related to the
exercise of the power not to record a conviction and the imposition
of monetary
penalties, but the Court imposed a term of imprisonment without indicating any
intention to do so or giving the appellant
the opportunity to be heard about
that as a potential disposition. That case is nothing like the present, where
the sentencing Judge
made his considerations as to a term of actual imprisonment
clear and counsel for the applicant made submissions as to why that penalty
should not be imposed.
[32] Nor is
there any substance to the complaint made in submissions that the sentencing
Judge failed to afford the applicant an opportunity
to request a pre-sentence
report so that an intensive community corrections order could be imposed.
Defence counsel had every opportunity
to make that application, and well
understood that the sentencing Judge was considering the imposition of a term of
imprisonment
in conjunction with an order suspending sentence.
proposed ground of appeal also has no merit.
