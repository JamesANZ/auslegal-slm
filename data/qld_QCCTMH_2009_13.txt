Introduction
Properties Pty Ltd as trustee and Daleside Pty Ltd as trustee t/a Beaudesert
Garden Estate (“the respondents”)
seek an order that the application
filed by Annette M Trout and the residents named on the document attached to the
amended application
filed 9 April 2009 (“the applicants”) cannot be
heard and determined on the ground that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.
applicants are the home owners at the Beaudesert Garden Estate, 339 Brisbane
Street Beaudesert and the respondents are the joint
park owners
original application filed on 3 February 2009 seek orders that work be commenced
on renovating existing (the internal) roads as
soon as possible and to be
completed by 31 March 2009.
applicants, in their amended statement of claim plead that:
The internal roads at Beaudesert Garden Estate are in a
deplorable condition. Ambulances have become bogged trying to turn around
bottom of Garden Grove while accessing a patient. Owners have failed for some
years to maintain the common areas (roads)
in a reasonable (or safe) state or
repair so that they are fit for use by home owners. The internal roads at
Beaudesert Garden Estate
are also our walkways.
The applicants seek an order to “
section 17(b)
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003
(“MHRP Act”) as
17(b) expressly provides that the park owner for a residential park has the
responsibilities in relation to a home owner;
to maintain the common
areas and communal facilities in a reasonable state of cleanliness and repair,
and fit for use by the home
respondents contend that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to make the
orders sought.
Respondents’ submissions
respondents submit that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to make the
orders claimed. They submit that there is no provision
in the MHRP Act giving
power to the Tribunal to make the orders sought and it is not a site agreement
dispute as provided for in
section 140. Further, they submit that the orders
sought are in the nature of a mandatory injunction and the Tribunal does not
Applicants’ submissions
applicants say that the internal roads at the park are unsafe and are not fit
for their use. Further, the respondents have an
obligation under section 17(b)
and they have failed to comply with this obligation. The applicants rely on
section 140 as it is
a site dispute.
Relevant legislation
and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
(“the CCT Act”) section 8
“8 Jurisdiction of tribunal
(1) The tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with the matters it is
empowered to deal with under this Act or an empowering Act.
(2) In exercising its jurisdiction, the tribunal is not subject to
direction or control, other than as provided under this Act.”
Act Schedule 2 provides:
“Empowering Act
means an Act, other than
this Act, that, whether expressly or by implication, authorises a proceeding to
be started in, or a matter
or thing to be dealt with by, the
MHRP Act section 17 expressly provides:
“17 Park owner’s responsibilities
The park owner for a residential park has the following responsibilities
in relation to a home owner—
(a) to take reasonable steps to ensure the home owner—
(i) always has access to the home owner’s site in the park;
(ii) has reasonable access to the common areas;
(b) to maintain the common areas and communal facilities in a reasonable
state of cleanliness and repair, and fit for use by the
(c) to ensure the times the park owner or park manager is available to
be contacted by the home owner are reasonable, having regard
circumstances, including the utilities supplied by the park owner to the
(d) to the extent it is within the park owner’s control, to ensure
the continuity of supply of a utility to the park and the
(e) otherwise, to comply with the site agreement for the site and the
park rules.
The responsibilities mentioned in this section are taken to be included as
terms of a site agreement under section 19.”
MHRP Act section 140 expressly provides:
“140 Site agreement dispute
If there is a site agreement dispute, either party to the dispute may
apply to the tribunal for an order, and the tribunal may make
any order it
considers appropriate, to resolve the dispute.”
Observations and findings
8 of the CCT Act provides that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with the
matters it is empowered to deal with under this
or an empowering Act and by
Schedule 2, the MHRP Act is an empowering Act.
For the Tribunal to consider an application and make the orders requested a
statutory power to do so must be enlivened by the application,
absence of a provision that gives this power, jurisdiction does not exist.
The applicants say the roadways at the park are in a deplorable condition and
the park owners have infringed sections 2 and 17 of
the MHRP Act. These
provisions set out the park owners’ responsibilities including the
responsibility to maintain common areas
and communal facilities in a reasonable
state of cleanliness and repair and that they are fit for use by the home
owners. The home
owners say the respondents have infringed these provisions and
they seek an order that the roads be repaired
However, there is no provision in the MHRP Act that gives the Tribunal power to
adjudicate on this issue and to make the order sought.
Puljich, D’Arcy, Kenmont Investments Pty Ltd & Dalma Plastering Pty
Ltd [2007] CCT MH023-06
, the Tribunal stated that:
“The application here in effect seeks to enforce a
contract under which the parties agreed to the termination of a site agreement.
The applicants remedy to enforce the deed of termination lies in an action of
common law. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
in relation to such action,
and has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the application”
am satisfied that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine
an application where it is alleged a park owner
has failed to maintain the
common areas and communal facilities in a reasonable state of cleanliness,
repair and that they are fit
for use as required by clause 17 of the MHRP Act.
There is no power expressed in the MHRP Act that gives the Tribunal power to
the orders sought.
Furthermore,
the orders that are being sought are in the nature of a mandatory injunction and
the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
to grant injunctions. Such an order is
only able to be granted by Courts of equity or bodies conferred with equitable
Finally, it was argued that a site agreement dispute exists between the parties
and accordingly section 140 gives the Tribunal jurisdiction.
A site agreement
dispute is defined in schedule 2 of the MHRP Act to mean a ‘dispute
between the parties to a site agreement
the agreement or the Act’. This clause must be limited to a consideration
of what are
the rights and obligations of the parties to a site agreement.
However, this case does not involve a dispute about the party’s
obligations under the site agreement or the Act. These rights and obligations
are clearly set out in the agreement and
the Act and there is no dispute about
what they are and mean. Furthermore, section 140 does not grant to the Tribunal
the power to
force the parties to comply with provisions of the MHRP Act, and
does not give to the Tribunal power to grant equitable relief.
am satisfied the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the
matter and make the orders sought by the applicants
in their application filed
on the 9 April 2009.
Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.
