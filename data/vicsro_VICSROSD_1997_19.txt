Transferring motor vehicle registration from the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (SD-090) [1997] VICSROSD 19 (1 November 1997)
Revenue Rulings
The purpose of this Ruling is to outline the
procedure for applying for a stamp duty exemption
where the registration of a motor vehicle which is
currently registered under the Federal Interstate
Registration Scheme is transferred to Victoria, by the
same owner.
The State Revenue Office issued a Bulletin (SD8/95)
in June 1995 which indicated that all such transfers
would be eligible for exemption under Exemption
(13) of Heading XXI of the Third Schedule of the
Stamps Act 1958
. Exemption (13) provides that the
Commissioner of State Revenue may exempt from
stamp duty an application to register a motor vehicle
where the applicant is the registered owner of the
vehicle in another Australian jurisdiction. Before
granting the exemption, the Commissioner of State
Revenue must be satisfied that the registration
outside Victoria is not in any way associated with the
avoidance of duty.
The purpose of granting the exemption in these
circumstances was to encourage vehicles which were
previously registered under the Federal Interstate
Registration Scheme to transfer registration to
the newly established Victorian National
Registration Scheme.
The Victorian National Registration Scheme has
operated since 1 July 1995. Considerable time has
elapsed to allow vehicles registered under the
Federal Interstate Registration Scheme to be
transferred to the Victorian National Registration
Scheme without payment of stamp duty. There is
also a need to prevent the exemption from being
abused and the automatic granting of the exemption
in all circumstances is no longer appropriate.
Exemption (13) of Heading XXI of the Third
Schedule of the
Stamps Act 1958
will be available
without formal application to the SRO, only for
transfers of registration of motor vehicles which were
registered under the Federal Interstate Registration
Scheme before 1 July 1996.
If an exemption is sought for a motor vehicle which
was registered under the Federal Interstate
Registration Scheme after 1 July 1996, an
application must be made to the State Revenue
Office for an exemption certificate. This application
has to satisfy the Commissioner of State Revenue
that the registration of the vehicle outside Victoria
was not in any was associated with the avoidance
of stamp duty.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of law.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be
read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
