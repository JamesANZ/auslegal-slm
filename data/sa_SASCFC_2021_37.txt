[2021] SASCFC
Full Court – Application for Admission: Livesey P, Blue and Bleby
THE COURT (
Introduction
1 Lisa Jane Barrett, the applicant, seeks admission as a barrister and
solicitor of the Supreme Court of South Australia. An order
is sought from this
Court pursuant to
Legal Practitioners Act 1981
Legal Practitioners Act
2 There is no issue about whether the applicant satisfied all of the
educational requirements of the
Legal Practitioners Act
, the Uniform Civil
Rules 2020 (SA) (

) and the Legal Practitioners
Education and Admission Council Rules 2018 (SA) (

The admission application
3 The issue was whether the applicant is a “fit and proper
person” to be admitted as a practitioner pursuant to
Legal Practitioners Act
. The application was referred to the Board of
Examiners for a report in accordance with
Legal Practitioners
4 Initially, the Board of Examiners was not satisfied that the applicant was
a “fit and proper” person because, based
on the material then
available, it considered that a number of serious errors of judgment had been
made in her previous career as
a midwife. There was a concern that the
applicant may have placed her own wishes and beliefs over the safety of the
women and children
whom she sought to assist, despite recommendations made by
the Health and Community Services Complaints Commissioner. She also intervened
in an inquest in 2011 in a manner which was initially regarded as
inappropriate.
5 In addition, the applicant did not attend a proceeding in the South
Australian Health Practitioners Tribunal which
likewise, initially regarded
as inappropriate. Although the applicant was charged with two counts of
manslaughter following home
birth deaths, she was
Reconsideration of the application
6 Following its initial decision, the Board considered further evidence and
explanations from the applicant and reassessed the matter.
The Board took into
account a number of decisions.
7 The Board found that the applicant had acknowledged that her previous
conduct was unsatisfactory and it accepted that she had learned
a great deal
experience and legal studies.
8 The Board emphasised that the applicant has not been convicted of any
criminal offence and, though there had been adverse findings
made by the Health
Practitioners Tribunal, there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The applicant is
no longer involved in birthing.
She explained the challenge made to the
so as to assist the birth mother and to minimise her stress rather than
avoid adverse findings against the applicant. The applicant’s
attend Tribunal hearings was, likewise, explained in a manner which the Board
found satisfactory. Again, this was due
to ignorance rather than any desire to
avoid or minimise responsibility.
9 It is appropriate to emphasise that, in response to questioning from the
Board, the applicant was regarded as open and frank.
She intends to pursue the
law as a means of helping people. She recognises a solicitor’s legal and
other obligations and,
in the view of the Board, she will display integrity, be
honest and comply with the laws that apply to her. There were persuasive,
positive character references which attest to her integrity, forthright manner
and desire to assist those who are vulnerable in society
and work towards social
justice. The applicant does not intend to practice in medical or health law.
She recognises her obligations

to undergo supervision for a period of two years, as must all
newly admitted
practitioners.

consider the Board’s reports, particularly the most
recent report dated

She will be admitted as a legal practitioner of this Court.
