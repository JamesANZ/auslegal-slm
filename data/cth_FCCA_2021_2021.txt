THE COURT ORDERS THAT:

REASONS FOR
JUDGE LUCEV
INTRODUCTION
1 On 18 February 2020 the applicants in this matter
filed an application for judicial review (“Judicial Review
Application”)
Migration Act
Migration Act
”) of a decision of the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (“Tribunal Decision” and “Tribunal”
respectively)
made on 21 January 2020. The Tribunal Decision affirmed a decision
of a delegate (“Delegate’s Decision”) of the
first respondent,
the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural
Affairs (“Minister”)
affirming the Delegate’s Decision to
refuse the applicants’ applications for a Regional Employer Nomination
(Permanent)
(Class RN) (Subclass 187) Visa (“Visa”).
2 The dispositive reason in the Tribunal Decision is
that the first applicant, Mr Wihendra, does not have an approved nomination for
the Visa. Relevantly, it is not in dispute that the success or otherwise of
this Judicial Review Application is contingent upon
the Court’s judgment
in PEG60/2020: Applicants’ Submissions at [2]-[3]; Minister’s
Submissions at [29];
Mora v Minister for Immigration and Border
[2018] FCA 1819
per Collier J;
Kaur v Minister
for Immigration and Border Protection
[2016] FCCA 1730
and [72] per
Judge Smith (consistent with
Minister for Home Affairs v Mohammed
(2019) 269 FCR 70
per Middleton, Bromberg and Kerr JJ).
3 The application for judicial review made in PEG60/2020 having been
dismissed: see
Cho v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services
and Multicultural Affairs
[2021] FCCA 2020
, it follows that the Judicial
Review Application in these proceedings must be dismissed. There will,
therefore, be an order that
the Judicial Review Application, filed on 18
February 2020, be dismissed.
4 The Court will hear the parties as to costs.
