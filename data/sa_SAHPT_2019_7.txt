REPRESENTATION:
Appellant: Mr A
Respondent: Mr A Schatz with Mr J
Solicitors:
Appellant: Dadds Jandy
Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor
Appellant filed an appeal in the Tribunal on 26 April 2018. The decision
appealed against was a decision of the respondent, made
on 27 March 2018,
under ss 178 and 179 of the
Health Practitioner Regulation National Law
(South Australia) Act 2010
(National Law), to impose conditions on the
registration of the appellant, requiring completion of specified further
education or
training within a specified period.
20 June 2018 the appellant filed an Application for Directions (AFD) seeking
orders that:
... the decision of the respondent to impose conditions
upon the registration of the Applicant communicated by way of letter dated
28 March 2018 (the decision) be stayed;
... the corresponding entry of the decision against the registration of the
Applicant be removed pending determination of the appeal
against the
... the corresponding entry of the decision on the public national register
be removed pending determination of the appeal against
the decision.
Tribunal heard from counsel in relation to the AFD on 23 July 2018. Issue was
taken regarding the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
to make orders sought by the
Tribunal did not grant a stay of the decision as sought. Nor did it order either
the removal of the entry of the decision against
the registration of the
appellant, or the entry of the decision on the public national register.
orders made on 23 July 2018 reflected a compromise position suggested by the
respondent in its outline namely as follows:
The South Australian
Health Practitioners Tribunal orders that:
conditions imposed by the decision of the Respondent of 27 March 2018 are varied
under s 18(4) of the
Health Practitioner National Law (South Australia)
(SA) so that they are not imposed on the Appellant’s
registration until the Tribunal determines the Appeal (subject to any
other order the Tribunal may make when the Appeal is determined).
costs of the Appellant’s Application for Directions filed 19 June
2018 to be costs in the cause.
for the appellant provided a written outline and spoke to the same. He said the
primary position of the appellant is that
the Tribunal can exercise its powers
under s 18(4) of the National Law and it can revoke the conditions that were put
in place by
the Board, and this can be done on an interim basis, pending the
outcome of the full hearing. In his written outline counsel also
contended that
the Tribunal had the power to grant a
Section 18(4)
In addition, if a National Board, or a panel of a National
Board, has exercised its power to suspend the registration of the person
subject of the proceedings or imposed conditions on the person’s
registration, the Tribunal may revoke or vary the suspension
or conditions so
said there is a real issue to be dealt with at the hearing of this matter. It
was an unusual case in that the appellant was
not being sanctioned for clinical
malpractice and as such presented a real danger to the public. At issue is
whether the evidence
could ever rise to the level requiring the Board to deal
with the appellant’s registration as regards the objectives set out
of Schedule 2 of the National Law (protection of the public).
stated that the exercise of the power to stay is not necessarily being pursued
on this application because of the lack of
practical impact on the appellant.
Something more than a stay is needed to remedy his current predicament.
primary issue is the impact upon the appellant through the ongoing existence of
the conditions on the National Register. This
has caused him to be stripped of
preferred provider status and has also caused him reputational damage.
is a serious issue to be determined at the full hearing of this matter. In the
circumstances of this case, the public interest
does not require the entry to
the National Register to remain in place. The balance of convenience falls in
favour of the appellant,
given the significant ongoing adverse effects of the
impugned decision. The appellant is entitled to and should be given the relief
sought pending determination of the matter proper.
for the respondent provided a written outline and spoke to the same. The main
thrust of the arguments advanced related to
the limited jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. The Tribunal only has the jurisdiction conferred on it by statute and
may only review decisions
where it is statutorily empowered to do so. The
parties cannot agree to the Tribunal exercising jurisdiction it does not
important issue is the extent to which the Tribunal has power to either stay a
decision of the Board as distinct from making orders
in relation to conditions,
and also the extent to which it has power of revocation and, if so, how that
revocation may be used.
made reference to a decision of the Tribunal namely,
Watherston v
Chiropractic Board of Australia
wherein it was said that the extent of the powers would include a power to
Counsel went on to say that
it was not clear as to whether that was an implied power or whether the Tribunal
was in fact saying that
an order to stay could be made pursuant to the express
powers under s 18(4). If the position is that essentially s 18(4) grants
powers and those express powers can be used in a way that will achieve
the same result as a stay, the Board has no issue at all with
the written outline
reference was
made to the extent of the power to revoke. The respondent contended that s 18(4)
does not confer a power to revoke
or vary a decision made by the Board but
rather a power to revoke or vary a ‘suspension or condition’ imposed
on registration.
term revoke is not defined in the National Law. Reference was made to decisions
dealing with the meaning of ‘revoke’,
‘rescind’ or
It implies a
permanency namely, if revoked it was no longer in existence and no longer able
to be reviewed.
point was made that if a decision was revoked, given that s 202(1) of the
National Law confers on the Tribunal power to confirm
or amend an
‘appellable decision’, or to substitute another decision for the
‘appellable decision’ it is
highly unlikely that s 18(4) could be
used to ‘revoke’ the decision before orders are made under s
the decision is to grant some relief the ‘safer’ course would be to
use the variation power to vary the date on which
the conditions take
National Law in this State, unlike Tasmania and the Northern Territory, has no
express power to stay. It is not a correct approach
to use the power in s 18(4)
to underpin a stay order.
Board herein has agreed that the appellant does not have to undertake the course
pending the determination of the
Consideration-Order
Tribunal has considered the issue of jurisdiction to make orders as sought by
the appellant in the AFD, namely the removal of
the entry of the decision
against the registration of the appellant, and the removal of the entry of the
decision on the public national
Tribunal considers it does not have jurisdiction to make such orders. As
referred to by the Board in its written outline, the
Board is required to keep a
register ‘up-to-date and
2-Division 3 contains the statutory scheme for the keeping and maintenance of
registers in relation to registered health
practitioners.
[Ss 222-228-National Law]. In particular s 225 states, inter alia, that
certain information must be recorded, namely,
if a practitioner has been
reprimanded, a condition has been imposed on the practitioner’s
registration, an undertaking has
been entered into or the practitioner’s
registration is suspended.
action taken by a Board in the maintenance of the register is not, as the Board
points out, such an action that is an ‘appellable
decision’, for the
purposes of s 199 of the National Law. The Tribunal is of the view that it lacks
such actions taken by the Board.
Tribunal is created by statute and only has such jurisdiction that is conferred
on it by statute.
any event, given the orders made herein, it was not necessary for the Tribunal
to go down that path.
Tribunal also considers that the power to stay proceedings before it is not
apparent. Section 18(4) is an express legislative
provision which enables the
Tribunal to act to ‘revoke or vary the suspension or conditions so
imposed’ by a Board, pending
the hearing and determination of a Complaint
or Appeal. What was said in the decision of
Medical Board of SA v N,
although involving
different legislation, would seem to be apposite – namely that this Court
(Supreme Court) ‘should have
no difficulty in inferring that the Tribunal
has the power to prevent an abuse of its own processes’, but it was not
permissible
to imply a power to stay
proceedings.
The Supreme Court has
power to order a stay of proceedings before the
Tribunal did not consider a stay of proceedings to be appropriate in any event.
The power to stay, despite what was said by the
Tribunal in
would seem to be beyond the power of the Tribunal as constituted by the National

been adjourned again, due to
the appellant consulting with new legal advisers.

apply to this judgment. The onus remains on any person
using material in the judgment to ensure that the intended use of that material
does not breach any such order or provision. Further enquiries may be directed
