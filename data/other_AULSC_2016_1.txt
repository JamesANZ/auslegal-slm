Costs Estimates [2016] AULSC 1 (11 March 2016)
LEGAL SERVICES COUNCIL GUIDELINE AND
COSTS ESTIMATES
Guideline and Direction seeks to promote consistency in the exercise of their
functions by local regulatory authorities in relation
to legal costs matters
under the Legal Profession Uniform Law (LPUL), other than in relation to dispute
resolution and professional
discipline issues.
also seeks to advance the objective stated by section 169 (a) of the LPUL to
ensure that clients are able to make informed choices
and the costs associated with pursuing those options.
these purposes, the Legal Services Council expresses its view that an estimate
of the total legal costs in a matter, as required
by section 174 (1) (a) of the
LPUL, is a reasonable approximation of the total costs that a client is likely
to have to pay in the
matter for which instructions have been given, expressed
as a single figure, from time to time (the estimate). The definition of
legal costs in this context includes professional fees, any disbursements and
GST, which should be separately identified, but
not interest: LPUL section 6. It
should be noted that where a costs agreement includes an uplift fee, that fee
should be included
as part of the estimate of total legal costs and the
circumstances in which it would be payable explained to the
should be noted that section 174 (1) (a) also requires a law practice to
disclose the basis on which legal costs will be calculated.
is at all times important that the matter for which the estimate is required is
clearly defined and understood by both the law
practice and their client and in
particular it should be explained to a client that the estimate is not a fixed
fee quotation.
requirement to give an estimate does not preclude a fixed fee quotation being
given if it is desired by the law practice so to
a law practice is required pursuant to section 174 (1) (b) to provide
information about any significant change to anything previously
disclosed, a
revision of the estimate may be required. Any revised estimate should also be
provided to the client in accordance with
that section.
provision of an estimate or estimates from time to time does not preclude the
provision of other information to a client about
the steps or stages in a matter
and the provision of such information to a client should be encouraged. It will
not be inconsistent
with section 174 (1) (a) to provide estimates for each of
the stages that the matter might reach, whether individual stage estimates
expressed as a single figure or as a range of figures, PROVIDED the law
practice, having considered all the circumstances and
the most likely outcome,
always gives the single figure estimate of the total legal costs in the matter
that section 174 (1) (a)
requires. It is permissible and may be desirable to
preface a single figure estimate with the word ‘about’ to reflect
the fact that the figure is an estimate and is not a fixed fee.
Having regard to its opinion that the following direction is necessary and
appropriate to ensure that the designated local regulatory
authorities to which
it is addressed act in a manner that promotes inter-jurisdictional consistency
in the application of the Legal
Profession Uniform Law and of the Uniform Rules,
the Legal Services Council HEREBY GIVES A DIRECTION TO:
➢ The Council of the Law Society of NSW;
➢ The Council of the NSW Bar Association;
➢ The NSW Legal Services Commissioner;
➢ The Victorian Legal Services Board; and
➢ The Victorian Legal Services Commissioner
to keep the Council informed at intervals to be advised of the extent to
which in their respective opinions the views expressed in
the Guideline–
Costs Estimates LSC 01/2016 are applied in practice and of any judicial or other
decisions that may come to
their attention concerning the interpretation of the
requirement of section 174 (1) (a) and (b) to provide an estimate.
