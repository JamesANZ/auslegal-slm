PROCEDURE BEFORE THE PERSONAL INJURY COMMISSION
proceedings were listed for preliminary conferences (by MS Teams audiovisual
links) on 11 July 2025, 15 August 2025, and 17 October

rates 2% higher than
the applicable cash rate set by the Reserve Bank of
Australia from time to time - I therefore note the agreed interest rates to be:
(i) 13 February 2025 to 17 February 2025 (5 days) at 6.35%;
(ii) 18 February 2025 to 19 May 2025 (91 days) at 6.1%;

– in accordance with s 85A of the 1987 Act;
(h) all parties agreed that (considering their ages) the amounts awarded to the
second respondent, the third respondent, and the
fourth respondent would (in
accordance with s 85 of the 1987 Act) be payable to the NSW Trustee and Guardian

of those respondents, and
(i) as a result, all parties agreed that the first respondent was required to

All parties requested that I approve this apportionment agreement.
am grateful to all parties for their assistance in these proceedings, and for

I am also grateful to
them for the courteous and respectful manner in which they have conducted
themselves.

FINDINGS AND
Who was dependent for support on the worker
25 of the 1987 Act provides:
death results from an injury, the amount of compensation payable by the employer
under this Act shall be-
(a) the amount of $750,000 (the ‘lump sum death benefit’),
which is to be apportioned among any dependants who are wholly
dependent for support on the worker or (if there are no such dependants) paid to
the worker's legal personal representative...”
The amount of
$750,00 has been indexed, and the parties have agreed that the correct amount to
be awarded as at 29 October 2024 was
4 of the 1998 Act then defines a dependant as
“‘dependants’ of
a worker means such of the members of the worker's family as were
wholly or in part dependent for
support on the worker at the time of
the worker's death, or would but for the incapacity due to
the injury have been so dependent...”
have carefully considered the statements/statutory declarations in evidence
(a) the applicant - dated 30 May 2025 (found at page 2 of the ARDW) and dated
31 July 2025 (found at page 1 of the applicant’s ALAD);
(b) Sam Greaney - dated 10 January 2025 (found at page 48 of the ARDW), dated
7 July 2025 (found at page 1 of the second respondent’s first ALAD),
4 August 2025 (found at page 1 of the second respondent’s second
ALAD), and dated 1 September 2025 (found at page 1 of the second
respondent’s third ALAD);
(c) Laura Greaney - dated 10 January 2025 (found at page 50 of the ARDW), dated
3 July 2025 (found at page 1 of the third Reply),
and dated 11 July 2025 (found
at page 1 of the third respondent’s ALAD);
(d) Emma McMaster - dated 27 June 2025 (found at page 1 of the fourth Reply) and
dated 10 August 2025 (found at page 1 of the fourth
respondent’s ALAD),
(e) Cathy Lorraine Greaney (the worker’s mother) - dated 10 January 2025
(found at page 49 of the ARDW).
evidence in these statements/statutory declarations is consistent as to the
applicant, the second respondent, the third respondent,
and the fourth
respondent all being dependent on the worker at the date of his death.
applicant and the worker were in a long-term relationship and had three children
(being the second respondent, the third respondent,
and the fourth respondent)
together. They all lived together at Bourkelands. The applicant and the worker
took responsibility together
for raising their young children. The applicant and
the children had reasonable expectations that the worker would provide support
for them into the future – see
TNT Group 4 Pty Limited v Halioris
(1987) 8 NSWLR 486.
applicant says in her 30 May 2025 statement:
“I confirm that
at the time of Jack's death, my children and I were financially dependent on him
for support, including but
not limited to living expenses, housing, medical care
and other necessities of life...My dependency on Jack was substantial and
and his income played a crucial role in maintaining our standard of
living...From his job, Jack earned around $84,000.00 per annum.
His total salary
package came to an amount of $92,595.00 which included car running costs (rego,
fuel, insurance and maintenance).
He also received a bonus of $5,000 in 2022 and
2023 due to larger production and profit yields in those years...I depended on
to help with the maintenance of our house including mowing, gardening and
general maintenance on the property...Jack was a very involved
and loving father
to our sons. Losing Jack has changed our lives dramatically, in every aspect.
There are no words to describe the
pain of losing him and how it will affect my
sons for the rest of their lives growing up not knowing their father and how
he was...Jack and I had the intention of providing continuous financial
support to our children throughout their lives, ensuring
they have a comfortable
applicant further says in her 31 July 2025 statement:
to Jack's accident, Jack and I had plans for our future together and intended to
spend the rest of our lives raising
our boys. The loss of Jack has significantly
changed many things in our lives however my focus will always be on our three
raising them in the way Jack and I had always intended.”
Greaney (in his 7 July 2025 statement) also refers to the applicant, the second
respondent, the third respondent, and the fourth
respondent being “all
financially and emotionally dependent on Jack along with relying upon him for
care giving activities
and labour”. Laura Greaney (in her 3 July 2025
statement) further says:
“At the time of Jack’s death,
Chloe and the 3 children were financially dependent on Jack for support. This
included general
life expenses together with living costs, housing costs and
medical costs. It was Jack’s intention to support his family financially
on an ongoing basis...Prior to his passing, Jack would help with the maintenance
of his family house including mowing, gardening
and general maintenance...Jack
was paying mortgage repayments on the family home...Jack also made ongoing
payments to the family
vehicle which they used as their main mode of
transportation.”
from the applicant, the second respondent, the third respondent, and the fourth
respondent, it now remains for me to determine
whether there were any other
persons who were dependent on the worker in that they had reasonable
expectations that the worker would
provide support for them into the future. In
this regard, I note the following evidence:
(a) the worker’s grandparents are deceased - see Sam Greaney’s 4
August 2025 statement;
(b) the worker’s father is deceased - see Sam Greaney’s 4 August
2025 statement;
(c) the worker’s mother has declared that she was not dependent on him and
did not seek any compensation in respect of his
death - see Cathy Lorraine
Greaney’s 10 January 2025 statutory declaration;
(d) the worker only had two siblings (Sam Greaney and Laura Greaney) - see Sam
Greaney’s 1 September 2025 statement;
(e) Sam Greaney has declared that he was not dependent on the worker and did not
seek any compensation in respect of his death –
see Sam Greaney’s
10 January 2025 statutory declaration;
(f) Laura Greaney has declared that she was not dependent on the worker and did
not seek any compensation in respect of his death
- see Laura Greaney’s
10 January 2025 statutory declaration;
(g) the worker was not married prior to his relationship with the applicant -
see Sam Greaney’s 1 September 2025 statement,
(h) the worker had no children other than the second respondent, the third
respondent, and the fourth respondent – see Sam
Greaney’s 1
September 2025 statement.
upon this evidence (especially the statement evidence from Sam Greaney, who
being the worker’s brother, is placed in
one of the best positions to know
his familial situation), I am satisfied that apart from the applicant, the
second respondent, the
third respondent, and the fourth respondent, there were
no grandparents, parents, siblings, spouses, partners, children or others
dependent on the worker for support.
How should the amount of
$938,600 be apportioned between the applicant, the second respondent, the third
respondent, and the fourth
respondent, pursuant to s 29 of the 1987 Act
29 of the 1987 Act relevantly provides:
“(1) The compensation
payable under this Division to each dependant of a deceased worker may be
apportioned by the Commission
or by the NSW Trustee.
(1A) The lump sum death benefit payable under this Division is not to be
apportioned if a deceased worker leaves only one dependant
(whether wholly or
partly dependent on the worker for support) and the whole of the lump sum death
benefit is to be paid to that
one dependant.
(1B) In apportioning the lump sum death benefit payable under this Division
between 2 or more dependants, the whole lump sum death
benefit is to be
apportioned among those dependants (so that the sum of the apportioned amounts
equals the full lump sum death benefit).”
indicated at paragraph 13 above, the parties have agreed an appropriate
apportionment of the lump sum payable under s 25(1)(a)
of the 1987 Act. The
agreement in this regard is:
(a) applicant – 50%;
(b) second respondent – 15.5%;
(c) third respondent – 16.5%, and
(d) fourth respondent – 18%.
consider this proposed apportionment to be a sound apportionment of the
appropriate lump sum having regard to the dependency levels
upon the worker of
each dependent. The apportionment allows the applicant to receive one half of
the lump sum, which is appropriate
considering that at the time of the
worker’s death, she had been in a long-term relationship with the worker.
There was no
evidence before me that the relationship was not likely to continue
indefinitely. Indeed, the evidence (especially from Sam Greaney,
Laura Greaney,
and Emma McMaster) suggests a very strong relationship between the applicant and
the worker, with them each mutually
sharing their family’s assets,
liabilities, finances and responsibilities. The applicant had a reasonable
expectation of receiving
substantial financial and other support from the worker
for over 30 years of his future working life. It is also important to note
the applicant was only 34-years-old when the worker died.
proposed apportionment also allows the children of the worker and the applicant
to receive appropriate allowances for their financial
dependence upon both the
worker and the applicant, in that they were totally dependent upon the two of
them at the date of the worker’s
death. This level of dependence was
likely to continue for many years, at least up until they had finished their
studies and begun
work. In this regard, the applicant’s 30 May 2025
statement is clear as to the worker’s absolute intent on providing
children with the best educational opportunities that he and the applicant
is no evidence before me that any of the children require any special medical or
other needs. However, the second respondent
is approximately 18 months older
than the third respondent, and the third respondent is approximately two years
older than the fourth
respondent. As a result as at the date of the
worker’s death, the fourth respondent could have expected to receive
from him for slightly longer than the third respondent, and the third
respondent could have expected to receive support from him
for slightly longer
than the second respondent. The small difference in the various apportionments
to the three children is entirely
appropriate in the circumstances.
therefore propose to approve the apportionment agreed between the
Are the applicant, the second respondent, the third
respondent, and the fourth respondent entitled to interest on the amounts
to them, pursuant to s 109 of the 1998 Act
109 of the 1998 Act relevantly provides:
“(1) In any
proceedings before the Commission, the Commission may order that there is to be
included, in any sum to be paid,
interest at such rate as the Commission thinks
fit on the whole or any part of the sum for the whole or any part of the period
the sum is payable, subject to the limitations imposed by this
(2) Interest cannot be ordered under this section-
(a) on any compensation payable under Division 4 of Part 3 of the 1987 Act,
(b) on any compensation payable under this Act for any period before a claim
for the compensation was duly made, or
(c) on any compensation payable under this Act for any period during which
proceedings before the Commission were adjourned on the
application of the
claimant for the compensation or pursuant to section 102.
(3) This section does not-
(a) authorise the giving of interest upon interest, or
(b) apply in relation to any debt upon which interest is payable as of right
whether by virtue of any agreement or otherwise.”
indicated at paragraph 12(f) above, the parties have agreed as to the interest
rates to be paid by the first respondent on the
amounts awarded to the
applicant, the second respondent, the third respondent and the fourth
respondent. There is also no dispute
between the parties regarding the period
during which interest is to be paid.
power of the Commission to award interest is however discretionary. The relevant
interest rate to be awarded is also within the
discretion of the
Commission.
v Doolan (No 2)
[1977] 1 NSWLR 601
), the Court of
Appeal said that it was necessary to determine in what respect a party has been
financially disadvantaged by delay
in the payment of (in that case) damages so
as to make an appropriate allowance of interest. Reynolds JA, Moffitt P and
agreeing on point, said:
“It provides an ancillary
power akin to an order for costs, and its purpose is to aid the court to do more
complete justice
between the parties than is otherwise possible ... It is not
designed to compensate a plaintiff for loss arising out of the cause
but to provide compensation where it is otherwise appropriate to do so for the
circumstance that a sum of money has been
outstanding to him for a period of
this reasoning, and considering the agreement of the parties, I am satisfied
that it is appropriate to exercise my discretion
to award interest.
relation to the interest rates to be applied, I have no hesitation in agreeing
with the rates proposed by the parties. In doing
so, I note the purpose behind
interest awards per
I also note that the rates are calculated
with reliance upon the Reserve Bank of Australia’s cash rates since 13
February 2025.
How are the amounts awarded to the applicant, the
second respondent, the third respondent, and the fourth respondent to be paid in
accordance with ss 85 and 85A of the 1987 Act

“(1) The following
compensation shall be paid to the NSW Trustee in trust for the benefit of the
persons entitled to the compensation--

worker's legal personal representative or a particular
person in accordance with
this Act or an award),
(b) compensation payable to a person who is mentally ill (unless the Commission
otherwise orders),
(c) compensation payable to a worker under the age of 18 years if the worker
agrees or the Commission directs that the compensation
be paid to the NSW
(d) a lump sum commutation payment which the worker agrees or the Commission
orders to be paid to the NSW Trustee.
(2) Any money so paid to the NSW Trustee may be invested, applied, paid out
or otherwise dealt with by the NSW Trustee in such manner
as the NSW Trustee
thinks fit for the benefit of the persons entitled to the money.
(3) If a surviving spouse (including widow or widower) (over 18 years of age
and not mentally ill) is the only person entitled to
compensation paid to the
NSW Trustee in respect of the death of a worker, the compensation shall be paid
out to the surviving spouse
in one or more lump sums determined by the NSW
(4) A reference in subsection (3) to the surviving spouse of a deceased
worker includes a reference to a dependant of the worker
who is the de facto
partner of the worker.
(5) In the case of a lump sum commutation payment, the NSW Trustee shall
exercise its powers under this section in accordance with
the agreement or order
under which it was paid to the NSW Trustee.
(6) The Commission may, for any sufficient cause, vary the manner in which
the NSW Trustee invests, applies, pays out or otherwise
deals with money under
this section.
(7) The NSW Trustee may apply for any such variation.
(8) The receipt of the NSW Trustee is sufficient discharge in respect of any
money paid to the NSW Trustee under this section.”

85, the Commission may authorise the payment of compensation referred to in
section 85 (1)--
(a) to the person who is entitled to the compensation, or
(b) to such other person, for the benefit of the person entitled to the
compensation, as the Commission thinks fit.
(2) Any such payment is to be made in the manner authorised by the
Commission.”
am given a wide discretion in accordance with s 85A of the 1987 Act in relation
to how I authorise the payment of the amounts payable
to the dependents. There
is no reason why I would not order that the applicant receive the amount payable
to her, and I will do so.
amounts payable to the second, third and fourth respondents however need to be
paid into trust funds as they are all well under
18-years-of-age. I note that
the applicant was initially considering setting up trust funds by herself in
this regard, and had sought
relevant financial advice. However, in my opinion,
those trust funds (as referred to in the applicant’s ALAD) were not
appropriate,
and I note (see paragraph 12(h) above) that all parties are now
content with the amounts payable to the second, third and fourth
respondents
being paid to the NSW Trustee and Guardian on trust for the benefit of those
respondents, in accordance with s 85 of
the 1987 Act.
a result of the need for these amounts to be paid to the NSW Trustee and
Guardian, the first respondent will be ordered to pay
management fees (in
accordance with s 25(1A) of the 1987 Act) as additional
compensation.
summary, I make the following formal findings:
(a) that the worker died on 29 October 2024 as a result of injury arising out of
or in the course of his employment with the first
respondent, pursuant to s
4 of the 1987 Act;
(b) that the applicant was dependent on the worker for support;
(c) that the second respondent was dependent on the worker for support;
(d) that the third respondent was dependent on the worker for support;
(e) that the fourth respondent was dependent on the worker for support;
(f) that there were no other persons dependent on the worker for support;
(g) that the first respondent is liable to pay the amount of $938,600 pursuant
to s 25(1)(a) of the
(h) that the amount of $938,600 is to be apportioned as follows, pursuant to s
29 of the 1987 Act:
(i) applicant – 50%;
(ii) second respondent – 15.5%;
(iii) third respondent – 16.5%, and
(iv) fourth respondent – 18%;
(i) that the first respondent is to pay interest on the amounts awarded to the
applicant, the second respondent, the third respondent
and the fourth
respondent, pursuant to s 109 of the 1998 Act, from 13 February 2025,
at the following rates:
(i) between 13 February 2025 and 17 February 2025 – 6.35%;
(ii) between 18 February 2025 and 19 May 2025 – 6.1%;
(iii) between 20 May 2025 and 11 August 2025 – 5.85%, and
(iv) between 12 August 2025 and 23 October 2025 – 5.6%, and
(j) that the first respondent is to pay management fees on the amounts awarded
to the second respondent, the third respondent, and
the fourth respondent,
pursuant to s 25(1A) of the 1987 Act.
Considering
my findings, there will be awards that the first respondent pay:
(a) an amount of $469,300 together with interest of $19,195.02 to the
(b) an amount of $145,483 together with interest of $5,950.46 as well as
management fees of $38,359.21 to the NSW Trustee and Guardian
on trust for the
benefit of the second respondent;
(c) an amount of $154,869 together with interest of $6,334.36 as well as
management fees of $46,057.42 to the NSW Trustee and Guardian
on trust for the
benefit of the third respondent, and
(d) an amount of $168,948 together with interest of $6,910.21 as well as
management fees of $52,436.12 to the NSW Trustee and Guardian
on trust for the
benefit of the fourth respondent.
parties will be given leave to approach the Commission on or before 6 November
2025 in order to correct any mathematical errors
in my calculations based upon
my findings.
