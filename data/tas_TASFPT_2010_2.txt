B Claridge v Forest Practices Authority [2010] TASFPT 2 (19 April 2010)
File No: 8/09 F D2/2010
B Claridge Appellant
Forest Practices Authority Respondent
This was the hearing of an appeal against a decision by the Forest
Practices Authority (FPA) to refuse to certify Forest Practices
Plan MJF0140 at
Gipps Creek
The appeal was heard at Hobart on 18
The appellant appeared in person
Mr T Leaman appeared on
behalf of the Forest Practices Authority.
Application
for Forest Practices Plan MJF 0140 (the FPP) was refused by the FPA on the basis
that the proposed operation would not
provide sufficient protection for a wedge
tailed eagle nest, number 1739, which occurs in the northern corner of the FPP
The Appellant appealed against that refusal.
FPP was for clear felling and conversion of approximately 115 ha of dry eucalypt
and plantation. The forest within the FPP area
comprised approximately 95 ha of
forest, 15 ha of
delegatensis
forest and 5 ha of
Tasmanian wedge tailed eagle (
Aquila audax fleayi
) nest is located in the
northern corner of the FPP area. The Tasmanian wedge tailed eagle is classified
as Endangered under the
Threatened Species Protection Act
and the Commonwealth
Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation
D3.3 of the
Forest Practices Code
identifies that threatened species will
be managed in wood production areas in accordance with procedures agreed between
and DPIPWE. These procedures include the use of planning tools such as
Threatened Fauna Adviser
, and the FPA Planning Guideline and the
requiring of forest practices officers to incorporate recommendations from such
tools into the FPP, or to obtain an endorsed Management prescription
for any threatened species occurring within areas of proposed
operations.
FPA consulted directly with the Threatened Species Section of DPIPWE (the TSS),
to determine specific Management prescriptions
for the land covered by the FPP,
noting the site has high significance for the wedge tailed
Threatened Species Advisory Committee has endorsed the use of the FPA Planning
Guideline. That guideline defines "significant
habitat" for the wedge tailed
eagle, as all habitat (both forest and non forest) within 500m and a 1km line of
sight of known nest
sites (where the nest tree is still present and known to
have been active in the last 30 years). Active management is permitted
areas of significant habitat (i.e. native forest logging). However, it is
advised that such areas are managed as native vegetation
was given on behalf of the FPA by Mr T Leaman, ecologist, and
Mr N Mooney, a specialist in wildlife management with particular
expertise with respect to birds of prey such as eagles. Their evidence was that
in Tasmania a 10 ha reserve is a minimum, and in
practice is generally
the present case in the opinion of Mr Mooney and Mr Leaman, proper protection of
the eagles and their use of nest number 1739 effectively
required the total
exclusion of 19 ha around the nest, with a further 32 ha of selective logging
with no plantation establishment.
That evidence was not effectively countered,
and the Tribunal finds according to it.
evidence on behalf of the Appellant was that the property had been acquired for
the purpose of logging; and the proposed exclusion
of 19 ha from forestry,
together with a further 32 ha of selective logging with no plantation
establishment, would cause a very significant
financial loss. That evidence was
not disputed, and the Tribunal finds accordingly.
the evidence on behalf of the Appellant was that the particular nature of the
forest concerned was such as to be unsuitable
for selective harvesting, because
of the risks which that would here entail to forestry workers. There was no
evidence to the contrary,
and in the present case, the Tribunal accepts that the
area which would be designated for selective harvesting under an appropriate
plan for protection of the eagle nest and its eagles, would not be practicable
for such use.
that evidence, the Tribunal considers that the only course properly open is to
affirm the FPA’s refusal to certify the
Forest Practices
decision of the Tribunal is that the refusal of the FPA to certify plan,
MJF0140, is upheld.
Tribunal will entertain any application for an order for costs in this appeal,
if made to the Tribunal in writing with supporting
submissions within the next
14 days. If requested the Tribunal will reconvene to hear any evidence in
respect of any matter bearing
on an order for costs.
the absence of any such application for an order for costs the order of the
Tribunal is that each party bears its own costs.
