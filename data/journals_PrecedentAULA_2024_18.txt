Dust to Dust
By Vaughan Hager
‘Up in the mornin'
Out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day’
‘That Lucky Old Sun’
I don’t know much about Alf – Alfred Henry Hager. But Pa grew up
in a simpler time. He spent his childhood in Melbourne’s
then working
class suburb of Kensington. It was mainly just abattoirs, cattle yards and horse
proving grounds back then. By the 1950s,
Pa had settled in Malvern’s
leafier surrounds with Nan. Australia was in boom. Men had returned from the war
and were keen
to work, settle and raise families after the strife of the past
decades of depression and war. Pa found work as a concreter, solid
plasterer and
bricklayer. Dirty work. I can say first hand. You often come home covered in
grit and mud, but that isn’t so
bad. You can wash that off. It’s the
dust that you really remember – years after it goes into your nose and
into your lungs. I remember my father telling me that Pa had been
diagnosed. I was about 14. He beat it, for a while, then it came
back and killed
him. Silicosis.
Silicosis, the ‘world's most prevalent occupational lung
comes from inhaling
crystalline silica dust. The lungs cannot clear these particles, which cause
inflammation and scarring to the
upper lobes, leading to shortness of breath,
cough and fever. Complications include lung cancer, lupus, sclerosis and
National Silicosis Prevention Strategy 2023–2028 and accompanying
National Action Plan
, Lung Foundation Australia estimated that up to 600,000
Australian workers are potentially exposed to silica dust each year, across
number of industries.
Between 2011
and 2022, 1,451 Australians died from lung diseases caused by exposure to silica
dust – 90% of them were men.
Silicosis may well be this generation’s asbestosis.
AUSTRALIA’S ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH STONE BENCHTOPS
Ministers representing the Commonwealth, states and territories agreed to
Safe Work Australia’s recommendation to prohibit the
use and sale of
engineered stone on 13 December
This is a product created by
combining and heat curing natural stone with materials containing crystalline
If you have stone
benchtops, there is a good chance they are made of engineered stone; the product
became extremely popular in home
renovations and new builds in the early 2000s.
Once installed, it does not pose harm – it is the dust created in the
of manufacturing and installing the product, cutting and grinding it,
which is harmful to health. The decision to ban it came after
considerable media
attention together with a counter-campaign by the manufacturers of engineered
stone products for a transition
to products containing low silica levels and for
greater education on safely handling and working with them. However, as reported
by the ABC, quoting from Safe Work Australia’s report: '[t]here is no
scientific evidence for a “safe” threshold
of crystalline silica
content in engineered stone’.
The ABC also reported that The Australian Council of Trade Unions had
‘vowed to stop engineered stone from entering worksites
by July 2024, if
governments did not outlaw the product by
With the ban in place,
from 1 July 2024, Australia will be the first country in the world to prohibit
the use, supply and manufacture
of all engineered stone products. Given the
likelihood of an expansion of litigation in this area, this topic should be of
to practitioners on both sides of the bar table as well as their
instructors and clients.
Recent developments may give the impression that the finding that disease
arises from the inhalation of silica dust is something of
a revelation. It
isn’t. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust were
first documented in 400 BC by
Hippocrates.
But it was during
the first Industrial Revolution when workers began to be routinely exposed to
dust inhalation, due to ‘advancing
mechanization of production
techniques’, and to suffer the consequences of
THE DUST DISEASES TRIBUNAL AND
GRIFFITHS v
With the medical and history lessons over, although perhaps only recently
learned, I turn to the focus of this article – the
Dust Diseases Tribunal
of NSW, ‘a unique court established to hear claims for compensation
brought by people suffering from
dust diseases as well as dependents of people
who have died from a dust
and then to some
exposition on the assessment of damages.
By the enactment of the
Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989
), the NSW Government established the Dust Diseases Tribunal. The DDT has
which arise where a
person has contracted a dust disease due to another person’s negligence.
Practice Note No 4 of 2023
, the DDT established a silicosis list. In
addition to claims related to silicosis, the Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction
cases related to 13 other dust diseases, including asbestosis and
pneumoconiosis,
‘any other pathological condition of the lungs, pluera or peritoneum that
is attributable to dust’.
An important aspect of the DDT’s jurisdiction is the ability to make an
award of provisional damages. In s11A of the
, the DDT can award
provisional damages where it is proved, or admitted, that there is a chance that
at some definite or indefinite
time in the future a person suffering from a
dust-related condition will, as a result (or partly as a result) of the breach
giving rise to the claim, develop another dust-related condition. For
example, where silicosis leads to lung cancer.
In recognition of the fact that many dust-related diseases can be late onset,
s12A of the
operates to exclude any provision of the
Limitation Act 1969
(NSW), which might prevent the bringing or
maintenance of proceedings before the DDT. Section 12B allows the estate of a
person whose
death has been caused by a dust-related condition to recover
damages for that person’s pain and suffering, as well as any bodily
mental harm suffered, or the curtailment of the person’s life, provided
that proceedings are commenced prior to the person’s
death. Each of these
provisions are important acknowledgements by Parliament allowing for the
recovery of compensation in circumstances
not generally available to other
personal injury claimants due to the insidious nature of dust-related diseases
and their effects
on both workers and their families.
The DDT applies ordinary principles of negligence is assessing liability for
compensation. The defendant, often an employer, but which
may also include a
manufacturer, property owner or some other third party, must be shown to owe the
plaintiff a duty of care, that
the duty owed to the plaintiff was breached
through some wrongful act or omission and that the act or omission caused or
contributed
to the plaintiff’s injury.
There is no market price for pain, and so proportionality is
As the court does not
have a crystal ball it will take into account the vicissitudes of life and apply
a discount to any damages
awarded for the future, accounting for factors that
may adversely affect a plaintiff that are unrelated to the effects of the
defendant’s
wrongs. If the injury suffered by the plaintiff is terminal,
the court can award damages for the loss of expectation of life, or
shortening of life by reason of the injury.
Practitioners in this area will be familiar with the heads of damage that are
commonly claimed, including for pain and suffering,
loss of enjoyment and
duration of life, loss of amenities and loss of income. However, in many
situations, plaintiffs become dependent
on a third party (often a spouse or
family member) to provide domestic or nursing services to them, and this is
worthy of some discussion.
Prior to the High Court’s decision in
Griffiths v Kerkemeyer
there was uncertainty as to whether an injured person who required long-term
care was entitled to claim damages for the voluntary
or gratuitous work of third
parties who attend to these needs and which are created as a result of the
injury. It is now clear that,
on the basis of proper evidence, the court can
award damages for past and future gratuitous services where the plaintiff is
by relatives or friends who provide nursing, assist with domestic
chores, help with travel or look after the plaintiff’s business
are incapacitated.
clear that in quantifying this type of loss the court will regard the commercial
rates that would otherwise be payable
by the plaintiff if they had to look to
the market to source these
The concept of ‘services’ is important in considering this type
of damage. In
Reid v Seltsam Pty
the plaintiff gave
evidence that when she left the house she required someone with her for
‘emotional support’. The defendant
submitted that the
plaintiff’s inability to leave the house unaccompanied was as a result of
her underlying agoraphobia, which
was not causally connected to the injury
suffered (mesothelioma). Justice Forbes rejected that submission and found that
the plaintiff
became fatigued and nauseous as a result of the mesothelioma and
that this, along with the increase in her appointments, meant she
needed someone
with her when she left her home. It was therefore the defendant’s wrongful
conduct that created the need for
additional care. However, her Honour did not
accept that emotional support, properly characterised as the psychological
to a plaintiff of supportive friends and family together with increased
social interactions, falls within the description of a ‘service’.
There is no doubt a loss of dignity in not being able to undertake personal
care and other activities independently and having an
increased reliance on
others. But damages of this kind are compensation for the time spent by others
looking after the plaintiff’s
needs. Justice Forbes quoted Justice
Campbell’s decision in
Wormleaton v Thomas &
who confirmed that
Griffiths v Kerkemeyer
damages are awarded to plaintiffs to
‘compensate them for the cost (whether actually incurred or not)
rendered to them because of their incapacity to
render them to themselves’ [emphasis added], finding, as Forbes J
highlighted,
‘that the benefit that we obtain from the company of friends
and family is not described as a
And so, it was
concluded that the indignity of not being able to provide services to yourself
is better claimed as part of the general
damages for pain and suffering, which a
court can award.
The obvious antecedent of not being able to provide services to yourself is
not being able to provide them to someone else.
Section 15B
Liability Act
(NSW) is lengthy. In substance, the section says that the
court can award damages for the services a plaintiff would have provided
someone else, but the court must be satisfied that the plaintiff had been
providing domestic services to the dependant before
the onset of the
plaintiff’s incapacity. It is also a requirement that the dependant cannot
be capable of performing the services
themselves. In
Amaca Pty Limited v
plaintiff, who suffered from a dust illness, had an adult son who required
24-hour care as a result of a motor vehicle accident
many years before. The son
was receiving extensive commercial care, but was also receiving substantial care
from the plaintiff. Some
of the care being provided by the father was passive
(keeping an eye on the son) with other parts being active (providing nursing,
cleaning and other domestic services). The Court of Appeal held that passive
care was gratuitous domestic service within the meaning
A court will consider the number of hours of care provided by a plaintiff to
the dependant and the extent to which it is reasonable
that those services be
provided by the plaintiff to the dependant. In
consideration of proper commercial hourly rates, $1,479,000 was awarded under
this head of damage. In
Piatti v ACN 000 246
the NSW Court of Appeal
confirmed that
damages are to be calculated by reference to when the
provision of the care would otherwise have ceased, if the plaintiff had not
acquired the compensable injury.
Many aspects of the assessment of damages turn on the quality and type of
evidence led by the injured person and their advisors. As
well as proper
evidence from the injured plaintiff themselves about the impact of the injury on
them and their loved ones, there
is often the need for lay and expert evidence
family has required and will require in the future. Given that in many
cases a dust related injury is a death sentence, with some
being short and
others long and often painful, it is important for practitioners to maximise the
recovery of damages awards as much
as possible so that the financial impacts of
these injuries are lessened. It is one thing to worry about dying and about the
of a premature death on your loved ones, it is another pain entirely to
have to worry about how it will be paid for together with
the shame of not being
able to do it yourself.
I am not sure what Alf would make of all this. He was a doer. Get in and get
the job done. Some are lucky enough to work in environments
where the threat of
insidious disease is relatively low. Others, mainly working in the trades,
don’t have that option either
due to the working conditions themselves or
through a lack of training, education or supervision on the part of employers.
me that it takes the accumulation of preventable deaths for action to
be taken to curb harms which are all too well known, but the

as well as employers and their insurers,
