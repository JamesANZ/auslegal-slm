REASONS FOR DECISION
History of the Application
[1] MAH is a young woman who turned 18 years of age in November 2008.
[2] Until February 2009, MAH resided with her mother and step-father (LM and
LG) at the family residence.
[3] MAH moved out of the family home and relocated to supported
accommodation, where, at the time of the hearing, she was residing.
[4] On 31 March 2009 the Tribunal received applications from LG and LM
seeking their appointment as MAH’s administrator and
guardian for personal
matters and for a restrictive practice matter.
[5] The Tribunal heard all applications on 31 July 2009.
The Issues and the Legislation
[6] The issues for the Tribunal included the matters outlined in
, 80ZD, and Schedule 4 of the
Guardianship and Administration Act
ss.123ZA(1)
(1)(ii)B, and
(4)(a) and (b) of the
Disability Services Act 2006
relevantly provides that the Tribunal may appoint a guardian
for a personal matter, or an administrator for a financial matter, for
the Tribunal is satisfied –
(a) MAH has impaired capacity for the matter; and
(b) there is a need for a decision in relation to the matter or MAH is likely to
do something in relation to the matter that involves,
or is likely to involve,
unreasonable risk to her health, welfare or property; and
(c) without an appointment -
(i) MAH’s needs will not be
adequately met; or
(ii) her interests will not be adequately protected.
[8] Section 80ZD outlines the circumstances in which the
Tribunal may appoint a guardian
for a restrictive practice matter.
[9] In determining whether or not MAH has capacity, the Tribunal must
consider the definition of capacity in Schedule 4 of the
Guardianship and
Administration Act
, for a person for a matter, means the
person is capable of-
(a) understanding the nature and effect of decisions about the matter;
(b) freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
(c) communicating the decisions in some way.
Section 14(2)
provides that the Tribunal may appoint the Adult Guardian
as guardian for a matter only if there is no other appropriate person available
for appointment for the matter.
outlines the “appropriateness considerations” to
which the Tribunal must have regard in deciding whether a person is
appropriate
for appointment as a guardian or an administrator for an adult.
[12] Section 123ZA outlines the circumstances whereby a service provider may
use certain restrictive practices on an adult, and provides
that one of those
circumstances involves the consent of a “relevant decision maker”
for the adult.
[13] Section 123ZA(4)(a) and (b) details those persons who are regarded as
relevant decision makers for certain restrictive practices.
The Parties
[14] The following persons attended the hearing as active parties:
LM adult’s mother
LG adult’s step-father
EB Office of
the Adult Guardian.
[15] The following persons attended the hearing as interested parties:
FS adult’s uncle
FI adult’s grandmother
HS Disability
FB Disability Services
KA Disability
SG Disability Services
BM Disability Services.
[16] In addition to the written material contained on the Tribunal file, all
of the parties attending the hearing were given the opportunity
to express their
views. These views, where specifically relied upon by the Tribunal, are
discussed below.
[17] The Tribunal received a written report from Dr H who stated he has been
MAH’s general practitioner since 4 October 2007.
MAH has a severe
intellectual disability from birth and severe autism from early childhood. Her
ability to understand and act on
information relevant for making decisions and
the extent of MAH’s appreciation of the consequences of the decision or
of a decision in relation to personal health care, lifestyle and
accommodation choices, and finances, is described as “Nil
ability, nil
appreciation”. MAH’s receptive and expressive communication is
severely disabled. MAH understands none of
the criteria of an Enduring Power of
Attorney. In summary, Dr H opines that MAH is incapable of understanding and
making complex
or simple decisions about personal health care matters, lifestyle
and accommodation choices, financial matters, and about the use
of restrictive
practices. MAH’s medication includes Risperdal which is used to treat her
autism and also to assist with behaviour
control. Dr H describes the restrictive
practices being used or intended to be used as including an antipsychotic agent
and to assist behaviour control. Further, MAH regularly needs
containment, seclusion, mechanical restraint. The use of restrictive
is appropriate for the safety of MAH and her carers.
[18] The Tribunal received a Support Plan, Restrictive Practices Transitional
Assessment, written on 9 June 2009 by HR, Project Officer
conjunction with HX, Senior Principle Program Officer (SRS). The Plan outlines
MAH’s challenging behaviours.
They include: self-injurious behaviour
(striking herself, causing bruising); assaulting others by way of striking,
kicking, scratching
and colliding with them. Relevant restrictive practices used
in this case or contemplated being used are described as chemical restraint
(fixed dose of Risperdal for behaviours associated with aggression and signs of
agitation), and seclusion when MAH is physically
targeting others.
[19] The Tribunal received a Community Visitor Transitional Report
Restrictive Practices dated 27 July 2009. The Report indicates
there may be a
number of restrictive practices in place for MAH, including: seclusion,
containment, chemical restraint, restricted
access to other service users’
[20] The Tribunal also received written material outlining allegations of
abuse committed against MAH largely by LM. In particular,
the material contained
the following forms:
(a) Child Abuse Notification Form (concerning incidents on 27 January 2007)
forwarded to Department of Child Safety. This form outlined
details of alleged
physical abuse directed at MAH by her step-brother, and later that day, alleged
threats and assault directed at
(b) Critical Incident Report Form outlining an incident which occurred on 9
February 2009. The Report details allegations of physical
abuse directed at MAH
by LM and witnessed by a DSQ staff member.
[21] HX (Specialist Response Service, Disability Services) told the Tribunal
that the restrictive practices outlined in the Transitional
Plan included
seclusion and chemical restraint. MAH’s access to sharp implements was
also restricted.
[22] LM gave the following evidence to the Tribunal:
(a) MAH’s present accommodation was a temporary measure. In the longer
term MAH needed to share supported accommodation with
co-tenants who were more
compatible with her.
(b) LM was also concerned with the extent of services provided by
Centercare. Her concerns included the fact that MAH’s support
workers did
not include a registered nurse, and the hours of support MAH was entitled to
(c) LM and her spouse were her daughter’s statutory health attorneys,
and this arrangement was working well.
(d) LM intended to bring her daughter home in the interim period before
longer term accommodation was found for her.
(e) LM stated that her daughter’s assets included furniture, TV, and a
collection of DVDs. The Australian Defence Force was
the only institution which
permitted LM to open an account for MAH, and this account was linked to an
account in the name of LG and
LM. MAH’s account was held in the name of LG
and LM as trustees. It had a current balance of about $100. In addition, from
time to time LG had “put away” money for MAH into an account in the
names of LG and LM. The amount of money involved
was approximately $1,000.
(f) LM stated that she had no objection to the appointment of the Adult
Guardian for certain personal matters and for restrictive
practice matters.
However, she did not support the appointment of the Public Trustee as her
daughter’s administrator, maintaining
that her own administration
appointment was more appropriate.
[23] LG told the Tribunal that he and LM are supervised (that is, another
person is in attendance) when they visit MAH. He and LM
find this objectionable.
In the context of a discussion concerning MAH’s medical records, LG told
the Tribunal that Dr H indicated
to him that MAH’s medical information
would be made available to relevant parties provided he (Dr H) would remain
medical practitioner in the future. LG said he did not query this
advice or press Dr H any further on this matter. LG stated that
objection to the appointment of the Adult Guardian as MAH’s guardian for
certain personal matters and for restrictive
practice matters. LG also stated he
had no objection to the appointment of the Public Trustee as MAH’s
administrator.
[24] KA (Disability Services) stated that LM had told her that she (LM) had
experienced difficulty at times managing MAH’s behaviour,
and that LM
needed LG at home at all times. However, this was not possible due to the
latter’s employment.
[25] FI is LM’s mother. FI stated that LM had been described as a slow
learner who had attended a Special School. FI stated
she had no objection to the
prospect of the Tribunal considering independent appointees in all areas of
decision making for MAH.
[26] FS stated that LM suffered stress in attempting to care for her daughter
over a long period, given MAH’s tendency to engage
in challenging
behaviours. FS also indicated his support for independent appointees in all
areas of decision making for MAH.
Does MAH lack capacity for relevant matters?
[27] The relevant issues in this case include a determination about
MAH’s capacity to understand and make decisions about personal
financial matters, and about the use of restrictive practices.
[28] No party attending the hearing disputed the opinion and conclusions
outlined in Dr H’s report. Those parties who made submissions,
LM, agreed that MAH needed assistance with decisions in all aspects of her
[29] In light of the unchallenged medical evidence and the support (or at
least the lack of objection) of all parties attending the
hearing, the Tribunal
concluded that MAH had impaired capacity for all relevant matters, namely,
personal matters, financial matters,
and restrictive practice matters.
Is there a need for the appointment of a guardian?
[30] The evidence of the parties reflected the lack of precision about the
actual restrictive practices in use or proposed to be used
for MAH. In
particular, the Report of Dr H is not consistent with the reports of others on
the subject of MAH’s medication
and the existence of chemical restraint.
[31] Nevertheless, the evidence is to the effect that there are at least some
forms of restrictive practices in place for MAH. They
are of a type which
require the consent of a “relevant decision maker” within the
s123ZA(4)(a)
Disability Services Act 2006
guardian for a restrictive practice (general) matter.
[32] Further, the Tribunal was satisfied that the criteria outlined in
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
had been met,
thus enabling the appointment of a guardian for a restrictive practice matter.
In brief, the relevant criteria were:
(a) MAH had impaired capacity for the matter.
(b) Her behaviour had previously resulted in harm to herself or others.
(c) There is a need for a decision about the matter.
(d) Without the appointment –
behaviour is likely to cause harm to herself or others, and
interests will not be protected.
[33] It may be beneficial for MAH for an appointee to
undertake a comprehensive health and medication review for the purpose of
her medication and the issue of chemical restraint. This will involve
a decision and directions by a guardian empowered to make decisions
care as well as restrictive practices.
[34] The parties’ evidence is to the effect that MAH’s
accommodation is only temporary and that there are issues with
the services she
receives. While it is LM’s intention to return her daughter to the family
term placement is found, it was the
allegation of abuse by LM against MAH which led to the latter’s admission
to a supported
facility in the first place.
[35] LG and LM are opposed to their visits to MAH being supervised by her
carers. The Tribunal was not advised who made the decision
in that regard or the
authority of the decision maker to do so. In any event, the arrangements about
be an ongoing issue.
[36] All parties supported the proposition that there should be a guardian
formally appointed by the Tribunal empowered to make decisions
for MAH in the
areas of health care, accommodation, provision of services, and with whom MAH
has contact and/or visits. Further,
all parties supported the need for the
appointment of a guardian for restrictive practices (general) for MAH.
[37] The applicable legislation requires the appointment of a guardian for
restrictive practices.
[38] In relation to other personal matters, the evidence indicates that
MAH’s informal support network is not functioning to
the extent that the
formal appointment of a guardian is not necessary.
[39] In the circumstances, the Tribunal concluded that there was a need for a
range of personal decisions required to be made for
MAH, and that without the
appointment of a guardian, her needs will not be adequately met or her interests
adequately protected.
[40] The Tribunal determined that a guardian for MAH should be appointed for
restrictive practices (general), and for other personal
matters being, health
care, accommodation, provision of services, and with whom MAH has contact and/or
If so, who should be appointed?
[41] The options for the Tribunal were LG and LM, and the Adult Guardian.
[42] While according proper respect to LG and LM, their evidence did not
indicate they fully understood the role and responsibilities
of a guardian. Nor
did they appear to understand the principles of substituted decision making.
Their description (and apparent acceptance)
of Dr H’s condition of
cooperation being his continued role as MAH’s General Practitioner points
to their naivety in
these matters. [In this regard, the Tribunal does not hold
that Dr H made such representation – only that this was the understanding
of LG and LM.]
[43] There is also evidence of altercations between LM and MAH which has been
described by witnesses and which do not appear to have
been isolated instances.
The Tribunal is aware of the difficulties involved in the care and upbringing of
a child, and then a young
woman, who has for some time demonstrated challenging
behaviours. The Tribunal makes no judgement about these allegations of abuse
committed by LM.
[44] Nevertheless, the allegations are matters which cannot be ignored. The
incidents comprise evidence which the Tribunal should
take into account when
determining the appropriateness of a proposed appointee for MAH.
[45] In any event, the submissions of all parties were to the effect that
MAH’s interests would be best served at this time
by the appointment of an
independent guardian.
[46] FI and Mr FS indicated that the appointment of an independent guardian
(for personal matters and for restrictive practices) would
ease the burden on LM
and relieve the strain on the mother-daughter relationship.
[47] After some discussion with Tribunal members about the functions and
responsibilities of guardians, both LG and LM indicated their
support for an
independent guardian who was familiar with relevant legislation and appropriate
principles.
[48] While the decision is of course a matter for the Tribunal, the
submissions and expressed preferences of the parties were compelling
[49] The Tribunal concluded that the support of LG and LM and other family
members for the appointment of the Adult Guardian was a
wise decision, and was
likely to produce outcomes beneficial to MAH. That is because in all the
circumstances the Tribunal was not
satisfied that at this point in time there
was an appropriate person available for appointment for relevant matters other
Adult Guardian.
[50] The Tribunal notes that its order for the appointment of the Adult
Guardian for restrictive practices (general) is not of itself
authority for any
party to use the restrictive practices of containment or seclusion. If it is
found necessary to approach the Tribunal
to give approval for a service provider
to contain or seclude MAH, the Tribunal envisages that the present order will be
when the Tribunal gives such approval.
Is there a need for the appointment of an administrator?
[51] There are ongoing everyday decisions of a financial nature which need to
be made for
MAH. Her condition is such that she is clearly unable to do
this for herself, and
MAH will likely require assistance in this regard for
the rest of her life.
[52] MAH has relatively modest assets and income. Her actual cash assets were
not able to be accurately particularised at the hearing.
The evidence of LM was
to the effect that certain moneys have been put away from time to time on behalf
of MAH and have been placed
into an account held by LG and LM. It is not known
if those funds have been merged with funds of LG and LM. If so, the actual
which is the property of MAH may be difficult to ascertain. In any event
this is a situation which should not continue.
[53] All parties who made submissions on this point indicated that it was
inappropriate for informal arrangements to continue for
MAH, and that it was in
her interests for the Tribunal to appoint an administrator.
[54] The Tribunal concluded that the informal arrangements presently in place
for MAH’s finances were inappropriate and should
not continue.
[55] In order to protect MAH’s interests, her assets must be verified
with clarity. There must be a formal recording process
in place so that her
income and expenses are identified and the appropriateness of the latter is
transparently justifiable. The Tribunal
was not satisfied this result would be
achieved if MAH’s present informal support network were left to undertake
[56] The Tribunal concluded that there was an ongoing need for day-to-day
financial decisions to be made for MAH, and that without
the appointment of an
administrator, MAH’s interests would not be adequately protected.
If so, who should be appointed?
[57] The options for the Tribunal included LG and LM, and the Public
[58] Apart from LM, the parties who made submissions proposed an independent
administrator, namely the Public Trustee. Those parties
included members of
LM’s family, although LM was firm in her view that she was an appropriate
administrator for her daughter.
[59] The Tribunal was mindful of the fact that LM’s informal management
of her daughter’s finances appears to have been
conducted with little
discipline or regard to proper budgeting principles. The Tribunal does not
suggest any dishonesty on the part
of LG and LM, but the fact remains that MAH
does not appear to have made regular savings, and those savings which may have
have been merged in a bank account owned by LG and LM, and remain to
be identified.
[60] The Tribunal concluded that LG and LM had not demonstrated an
appropriate knowledge of substituted decision making or a sound
understanding of
the financial arrangements they would need to make if they were to be appointed
administrators for MAH.
[61] The Tribunal was also cognisant of the present difficulties facing LG
and LM in their ongoing support of MAH. The appointment
of a family member to
make financial decisions has the real potential to place further strain on the
family relationships.
[62] In all the circumstances, including the weight of evidence of the
parties, the Tribunal concluded that the appointment of the
Public Trustee as
MAH’s administrator for all financial matters was an appropriate
appointment in this case.
[63] Orders were made accordingly.
