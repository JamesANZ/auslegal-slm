Graw, Stephen --- "Preface" [2024] JCULawRw 1; (2024) 30 James Cook University Law Review i
In this year’s annual Mayo Lecture, Judge Nathan Jarro presents
‘An Aboriginal Perspective (from the Bench),’ discussing
a little of
his own background, sharing some of his observations, made as a circuit judge in
Townsville, Mount Isa, and, to a lesser
extent, Cairns, where the Indigenous
population is more obvious than that of South-East Queensland, and reflecting,
in particular,
on the make-up of juries in the criminal trials over which he
presided. He notes the apparent lack of Indigenous members of those
considers the possible reasons for their absence – with emphasis on the
findings and recommendations of the Australasian
Institute of Judicial
Administration (’AIJA’) June 2023 report,
‘The Australian
Jury in Black & White – Barriers to Indigenous Jury
Representation’
Dr Bede Harris’s paper looks at the impact of conflicts between animal
owners and bodies corporate, noting that such conflicts
are ‘a notorious
feature of communal living’, not helped by the fact that the powers that
bodies corporate have over
animal ownership vary widely between Australian
animal containment measures and suggests a number of statutory reforms
that could re-balance the law.
Problems with the absence of single legal framework to govern digital trade
is the topic of Haodi Deng’s paper. It considers
the main causes for the
fragmentation of the available regimes and suggest a role for the WTO in
creating and standardising a multilateral
digital trade agreement within its own
legal framework to complement and eventually supercede the rules under the
existing regional
trade agreements (RTAs).
Pre-filling, by the ATO, of information on personal income tax returns is now
a standard feature of taxation administration both in
Australia and overseas.
However, one potentially major consequence of that change is not yet recognised
in the legislation –
the ongoing onus on taxpayers to ‘get it
right’. In his paper Professor Rob Woellner reflects on whether the onus
proof provisions in
Taxation Administration Act
(Cth) are still fit for purpose or, indeed, fair, given the amount of
information on which the Commissioner now relies in making an
assessment which
is, in no real sense, sourced from the taxpayer.
Two papers consider practical aspects of legal practice. In the first, Barry
Yau and Glenda Bloomfield examine what happens to law
graduates once they
complete their degrees and report on the results of a longitudinal study into
the motivations of those who choose
not to pursue (or to continue) a formal
career in the legal profession. In the second, Maxine Evers probes a
significant, but poorly
understood, cohort within the legal profession, the sole
practitioner. Her paper notes that, despite their contributions
to the legal profession in general and the communities they serve
in particular,
their contribution to ensuring access to the law tends to be lost in the
confusing definitions of sole and small firm
practitioners. Her article
acknowledges their unique place in the profession and suggests that it will only
be properly recognised
if the concept of pro bono work is more broadly
Continuing with the legal profession theme Dr Jason Donnelly looks at the
critical role of timely written reasons in legal decision-making.
It explores
the implications of delayed written reasons, particularly in high-stakes cases
such as migration and visa cancellations,
where timely decisions are essential
for justice. It also underscores the necessity of thorough reasoning in both
urgent and routine
matters and highlights the need for administrative bodies to
be adequately resourced to deliver well-reasoned, legally sound and
Moving from legal decision-making to Ministerial decision-making, Jason
Livori and Harry Yous examine the
radioactive waste facility
decision by the Federal Minister for Resources that was set aside following a
challenge by the Barngarla
Determination Aboriginal Corporation on the grounds
of apprehended bias, legal unreasonableness, and alleged errors of law. The
focuses on the successful apprehended bias argument and on the risks, for
a Ministerial decision-maker, of allowing the distinction
between their
political and decision-making roles to blur.
In their paper Dr Sean Mulcahy and Professor Kate Seear review the effect of
Queensland’s 2019 inclusion of a right to health
services in its human
rights charter on access to those services by people who use drugs. They
conclude that, while there are no
signs that the right to health services is
retrogressing, there are some situations in which it is being deliberately
where compliance with the right has ramifications for other human
rights of those people.
In the concluding paper in this volume Kaushalya Madugalla looks at how the
competing interests of copyright owners and copyright
users are balanced –
considering the question through the lens of the two provisions in the
(Cth) that permit libraries and archives to copy
paper discusses several reasons why it has been difficult to achieve a
workable balance and suggests that it will only be achieved
through targeted
clarifying legislation.
Finally, and in closing, the Editorial Board would like, once again, to
record our sincere appreciation of the significant commitment
contributors and our referees of both time and intellectual rigour. Without them
the diversity of legal scholarship in this,
volume of the
JCULR, would not have been possible. We are very grateful.
