Editors --- "Editorial" [2009] AUJlMOA 1; (2009) 1(1) Australian Journal of Maritime and Ocean Affairs 1
Welcome to the first issue of the
Australian Journal of Maritime and Ocean
. AJMOA is published in Canberra by the Australian Association for
Maritime Affairs (which previously published
Maritime Studies
AJMOA aims to explore and advance understandings of human activities at sea.
It will publish high quality papers which address topical
issues concerning
maritime affairs or marine environmental issues. It is a multidisciplinary
journal that will enable scholars and
professionals in the field to exchange
views related to the management of activities that take place on, in or
underneath the ocean.
In addition to providing a forum for the dissemination of
research, it will also provide a vehicle for constructive criticism and
AJMOA has a special focus on the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions
although papers which examine issues of global marine or maritime
significance
will also be considered. The editorial team will from time to time publish
special issues on particular themes, such
as our forthcoming themed issue
entitled ‘Shipping in the Asia Pacific Region’.
In this first issue we have an article by Malaysian scholar Rizal Abdul
Kadir, which examines the implications of maritime transport
services for
developing countries, and an interesting historical piece by Dr Don Chambers on
the long voyages of early Tasmanian-built
boats. Joytishna Jit also offers an
appraisal of the Australian Government’s new national framework for marine
research and
innovation.
