COURT OF AUSTRALIA
NCC 1580 of
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
Introduction
is a case in which the two parents earnestly seek what is best for their two
children, particularly in relation to their education
given some financial
constraints which affect them both. Both parents would like to spend as much
practical time with both children
as can be put into place subject to
availability in conjunction with work commitments and suitable accommodation.
Both parents have
regard for the other’s parenting ability and there is no
suggestion at all of inappropriate use of alcohol or prohibited substances
family violence.
parents however are unable to agree upon matters concerning education and are in
dispute as to the amount of time each child should
spend with each parent,
parental responsibility so far as concerns education, the age at which both
children should determine the
time they spend with each parent independently of
any orders and some practical matters. These issues are best summarised as
from different styles in parenting.
is common ground that one of the continuing sources of conflict in the
relationship was finance exacerbated by disagreement on
choice of schools for
the children and the attendant cost.
subject children are [X] born [in] 1997 (“[X]”) aged 15 years and 5
months of age at the time of the hearing and a
pupil in Year 9, now Year 10 at
[S] School in [M] and [Y] born [in] 2001 (“[Y]”) aged 11 years and 4
months at the time
of the hearing and then a pupil in Year 5 now Year 6 at [C]
School in [W].
the time of the hearing [X] had casual employment at [omitted] on Tuesday and
Friday and Saturday afternoons.
The respective applications at the hearing
respective applications crystallised at the time of the hearing and were
somewhat different from the initiating applications.
orders sought by the father are found in his case outline. The father has at all
times represented himself in these proceedings
and in such a manner that I am
satisfied he was not disadvantaged.
was satisfied from the affidavit material upon which the father relied and the
manner in which he conducted himself during the hearing
both in his own case and
cross-examination of the mother and the Family Consultant that he was able to
present to the Court every
aspect of his case which he considered important. I
am satisfied also that the father had a good understanding of the principles
Court is required to apply and the relevant law under
of the Act in
relation to parenting proceedings.
father sought orders on a final basis which I précis as
parents have equal shared parental responsibility for the children;
both children remain at their current schools until the end of 2013 except if
the mother is unable to pay the school fees or
negotiate a payment plan with the
schools or the children are expelled in which case the children are to attend
Public Schools selected
by the father and with the children to attend Public
Schools from 2014 unless all current outstanding school fees are paid;
the children live with the father from after school on the Monday until 5.00pm
Sunday each alternate week during school terms
and school holidays and with the
mother for the balance of the fortnight. In other words, the children would be
with their father
for 6 nights in each 14 nights and for 6 days;
each child attains the age of 16 years they spend alternating defined periods
with each parent at Christmas, a fixed period
with each parent at Easter, with
the mother for the greater part of the Mother’s Day weekend and the father
for the greater
part of the Father’s Day weekend with other special
provisions for children’s birthdays and other special occasions;
and unrestricted telephone communication;
prohibition on overseas and unaccompanied travel in the absence of agreement,
and a variation of arrangements if either child travels
within Australia with
either parent;
injunction restraining the mother from affecting any change to the
children’s surname in the absence of consent;
injunction restraining the mother from leaving the children alone in the
presence of a Ms C, later identified as Ms C;
number of other practical parenting orders including notification in an
emergency, change of contact particulars, authority to obtain
reports from
medical practitioners and that medical expenses less than $50.00 incurred for a
child be met by that parent but medical
expenses in excess of $50.00 be shared
the course of the hearing the father proposed an alternate position he was
prepared to consider but emphasising that it was
not his preferred position nor
indeed his application. The alternate position would be that both children live
with him during school
terms from Tuesday, and by inference after school on the
Tuesday until the following Sunday at 5.00pm and on a fortnightly
mother seeks orders in accordance with her amended response filed 27 July 2012
which I précis as follows:
there be equal shared parental responsibility except for education;
the mother have sole parental responsibility for decisions concerning
the children live with the mother;
[X], the elder child spend time with the father concurrently with the younger
child but otherwise by agreement between the parents
until the younger child attains the age of 16 years he spend time with the
father each alternate weekend during school terms
from 3.00pm Thursday until
5.00pm Sunday, for half of each school holiday period alternating between the
first half and the second
half in even and odd numbered years and for special
periods at Easter and the Father’s Day weekend;
the children spend time with each parent on special occasions and with the
mother each year to enable the mother and the children
to attend an annual
Church camp;
the father pay half of all dental and optometrist expenses and medical expenses
not including General Practitioner visits for
both children;
father to pay half of all driving related expenses and lessons for both
father to pay the mother each calendar year one half of the children’s
sporting and extra-curricular activity costs;
telephone communication;
number of other practical parenting orders very similar to those proposed by the
Existing orders

their mother on the Mother’s Day weekend
from 5.00pm on the Saturday until

24 August 2012, at the conclusion of the second day of hearing the Court made an
order that each parent is restrained from removing
either child from their
present school and each parent is further restrained from enrolling either child
in any other school noting
that [X] was currently attending [S] School and [Y]
was attending [C] School.
17 October 2012 the Court ordered that during the 2012 Christmas School holidays
[X] and [Y] spend time with the father from 5.00pm
Thursday 3 January 2013 until
9.00am Monday 7 January 2013 and from 5.00pm Thursday 17 January 2013 until
9.00am 21 January 2013
or such other times as the parents agree in writing, and
by consent it was agreed and ordered that the children spend time with the
mother from 10.00am 24 December 2012 (Christmas Eve) until 10.00am 26 December
2012 (Boxing Day) and with the father from 10.00am
26 December 2012 until 3.00pm
28 December 2012.

distance between the parent’s homes is currently about
2.5 kilometres
and a short drive by motorcar, something less than 10 minutes. Evidence was
given by both parents of negotiations having
commenced for alteration of
property interests and whilst the mother could not say with any precision as to
where she would live,
she made it clear it would be within the Newcastle area in
a District which she could afford but preferably in the same area so as
facilitate the children travelling with ease to their current schools or at the
worst, there would be a bus service to take them
to and from their present
schools. Similarly, the father’s evidence is clear that he does not
propose to leave the area where
he currently lives, and if he is to find other
accommodation, it will be in the same district.

seems to me the issues are these:
are the appropriate parenting arrangements for [X] and [Y] both in the immediate
future and the longer term given their ages;
is the nature of the relationship between the parents and their ability to
communicate about their children;
the level of conflict between the parents preclude them from being able to
discuss with the prospect of reaching an agreement
matters concerning the long
term care, welfare and development of the children, particularly education and
such that an order for
equal shared parental responsibility is not appropriate
or, whether such an order is appropriate for all matters, or whether education
should be quarantined in favour of the mother or the
weight to be attached to the wishes expressed by each of the children both as to
equal shared time with each parent or otherwise;
the father’s present accommodation is appropriate for the

for a presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when a parenting order

The presumption
may also be rebutted if there is evidence to satisfy the Court
that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's
to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
relevance of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility where it
does apply or is found to apply is that the Court
is then obliged to consider
making an order if it is consistent with the best interests of the child and
reasonably practicable for
the child to spend equal time with each of the
parents. If equal time is not in the interests of the child or reasonably
practicable,
the Court must go on to consider making an order, if it is
consistent with the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable,

a much more practical manner how a child's development
can be nurtured and
promoted by being exposed to and enjoying in a beneficial sense all the aspects
of living with each parent.
It seems to me that this requires an involvement in
the whole of the ordinary household routine where it is appropriate. See the

principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is
one which is important, significant and valuable to the child.

addressed as part of the process of considering
the consequences of the
application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the
requirement for time with
children to be, where possible and in their best
interests, substantial and significant”.
(1) (a) in my view leaves no doubt as to the role to be played by either
parent in having a meaningful relationship in the lives
of their children.
the Full Court decision of
Honours Bryant CJ, Faulks and Boland concluded that there are three possible
interpretations of
section 60CC(2)(a)

of the benefit to a child of a meaningful relationship is “the prospective

Full Court rejected the notion that a Court should assume there is a benefit to
all children in them having a meaningful relationship
with both parents, finding
that if the legislature had intended to elevate the benefit to a child of a
meaningful relationship to
a presumption, then it would have said so in clear
and unambiguous
Honour Justice Bennett discussed the terminology in
finding that
the enquiry was a “prospective” one which requires the Court to
evaluate the extent to which a meaningful
or significant relationship with both
parents is going to be of advantage to a child.
Full Court accepted as appropriate the interpretation of “meaningful
relationship” set out by Brown J in Mazorski
(supra), and consistently
with their conclusions also agreed with the reasoning of Bennett J in
Full Court also
reaching these conclusions, we also considered the legislation requires a Court
to focus on the
to the child of a meaningful or
significant relationship. No doubt in the majority of cases there will be a
positive benefit to a
child of having a significant relationship with both
parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive
to be derived by a child by a Court attempting to craft Orders to foster
a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the
child’s best
interests.”
Consequently,
I conclude that I am bound by the existing authorities, some of which I have
referred to in the preceding paragraphs,
and subject to the facts of this
particular case. It seems to me the legislation provides a focus and emphasis
on both parents being
not only involved but substantially involved with the
lives of their children except when it is or would be contrary to the child's
best interests.
The Family Report
interviews for the Family Report were conducted by Ms D with the parents and the
children on 8 December 2011 together with observation
sessions with some
supplementary telephone interviews later in the month.
upon the evidence before me, I am satisfied that Ms D set out accurately the
parties perceptions as to the onset of the
breakdown of their relationship and
the causes.
mother told Ms D that she was seeking a continuation of the current
arrangement
the children primarily live with her and spend time with their father
fortnightly from Thursday to Monday but indicated
her preference for the
children being returned on Sunday afternoon rather than on a Monday. It is
significant however that the mother
amended her response on 27 July 2012 when
she sought orders quite different from her proposal to Ms D, namely that [X] be
to spend time with her father at any times [Y] was spending time with
his father pursuant to Orders, or by agreement between the
mother and the father
and [X]. In other words, the mother had varied her proposal and was proposing at
the time of the hearing that
there be no compulsion for [X] to spend time with
the father.
mother told Ms D that she perceived the father was motivated to bring his
application as a consequence of his obsession with money,
that is the
father’s reluctance to spend money and his fear and belief that she would
remove the children from Australia to
live with her father in Guatemala, which
the mother denied was to occur.
father told Ms D that he would like the children to live week about, one week
with him and one week with the mother on the premise
that he did not spend
enough time with the children but would also like some flexibility to negotiate
different arrangements from
time to time, about which he had some confidence the
mother would
parent criticised the other’s parenting capacity or ability to
any extent that the other parent’s time should be limited or supervised.
The mother raised some criticism of the father
of a relatively minor
parents told Ms D that they should share parental responsibility although it is
clear from the issues identified by the father
that he wished to have all
responsibility for school choice because the mother could not make rational
decisions and had a fetish
for private schools which he could not
father reported to Ms D that the children had changed schools three times in two
years as a consequence of the parent’s
inability to agree on schools, and
that the father wanted to be involved in the process of decision making as to
D found [X], during her interview with her and who was then 14 years and 8
months of age to be an assertive confident child who
was very cooperative during
the interview and interacted with the Family Consultant well.
told Ms D that she enjoys her current school, that is [S] School and that she
would like to attend [F] School for Years 11 and
12, that is 2014 and 2015. Ms D
noted the mother’s concerns that [X]’s academic performance had been
declining which
the mother attributed partly to separation but also to the
father having removed both children from schools they had previously enjoyed
a consequence of financial circumstances. It is the mother’s view that the
children should attend schools of the children’s
choice with the mother
also to have some input into the decision making process for schools.
D agreed with the mother’s assessment of [X]’s development
consequent upon her interview with [X].
agrees with her mother’s proposals but wants to spend time with her father
from Thursday until Monday. [X] did not
agree with the father’s proposal
that is from after school on Monday until 5.00pm on Sunday, or week about for
the reason she
finds the father’s home unstable and has some criticism of
the nature of the accommodation.
told Ms D that she would like to spend Christmas Day with her mother, is happy
to spend some time with her father on her birthday
but not the whole day or half
a day and two or three hours would be sufficient and is happy to spend time with
her father on Father’s
Day but wants a less structured approach to the
holidays stating specifically that she does not want to spend half the holidays
him but rather some intermittent time.
D found these views to be developmentally
appropriate
is of an age were she can make decisions for herself in terms of where she wants
to live primarily, further commenting that
these views show maturity in respect
of what [X] wants for herself. Ms D reported specifically that these views did
not appear to
have been influenced by either of the parents.
to [Y], Ms D found him to be a warm and friendly child who openly and willingly
answered the Family Consultant’s questions
and presented as a very jovial
told Ms D that he does not really enjoy attending [C] School, which is his
present school and would prefer to attend [P] School
where he was previously a
pupil and has friends.
parents told Ms D that [Y] is presenting developmentally within normal
parameters and that his behaviour is stable and that he
is maintaining his
performance at school despite his parent’s separation. Ms D concurred with
such assessment following her
interview with him.
told Ms D that he agrees with the mother’s proposals but would like to
spend additional time with his father from Monday
into Tuesday but does not
agree with the father’s proposal for either spending time with him from
after school on Monday until
5.00pm on Sunday or week about. His reasoning was
the same as [X] and there is some criticism of the father’s
accommodation.
wanted to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day until 7.00pm with his mother and
then spend the remainder of Christmas Day and
Boxing Day with his father, one
week during school holidays alternating with his mother in such fashion and with
the morning of his
birthday with his father and the remainder with his mother.
D found these
developmentally appropriate as [Y] presented as a very mature person at the
interview and also appeared to know exactly what
he wanted for himself. Ms D
considered such views showed maturity and appeared not to have been influenced
by either parent.
her evaluation
D considered that the views of both children should be given sufficient weight
due to their ages and their level of maturity.
D considered that the impact of the father’s proposal on the children is
that it would be too disruptive for the children
to live in the father’s
house one week and the mother’s the next week with the children having
already identified that
they prefer living primarily with their mother due to
the state of the father’s
D considered that the impact of the mother’s proposal meant that the
children’s current routine would be maintained
and with which the children
appeared happy and with the mother’s proposal representing greater
consistency for meeting the
D recommended that the parents have equal shared parental responsibility and
that [X] live primarily with her mother and spend
fortnightly periods with her
father from Thursday to Monday, and that [Y] live primarily with his mother and
spend time with his
father fortnightly from Thursday until Tuesday with the
children’s requests as to other time to be put into place.
D suggested that the arrangements not be flexible for the reason that this was
likely to cause issues that would impact upon the
D considered that telephone communications should continue as it was and that
consideration be given by both parents to the children’s
preference as to choice of school.
Weightman, Counsel for the mother asked Ms D in cross examination whether it was
appropriate for the Court to prescribe a specific
time for [X] to spend with her
father given that she now had casual employment on Tuesday, Fridays and Saturday
afternoons, was reaching
the age of 16 years in March 2013 and also having
regard to her maturity.
D considered there was no benefit or necessity for [X] to spend specified time
with her father both because of her level of maturity,
her age, the fact that
she had obtained some employment all of which indicated that she was growing up
and able to make decisions
on her own with regard to such matters.
asked by Mr Weightman whether Ms D considered there was any possible concern of
the mother interfering with the flexible arrangement
for [X], and by way of
illustration whether she may be overbearing Ms D considered it was unlikely.
From her notes, the mother had
not been overbearing during the interview, and
[X] had expressed her views independently, and as she assessed at the time, free
any parental or other influence.
to [Y], Ms D said that it was [Y]’s idea to enlarge his time until the
Tuesday morning and that was something he had raised
specifically with her.
D was asked to consider whether it was appropriate for [Y] to look after himself
in the morning when staying with his father if
neither his sister or paternal
grandmother were present. Ms D considered that she would have some concerns
given his age as to both
his safety and a number of general matters concerning
getting himself dressed for school, having an appropriate breakfast and getting
to school but more importantly what would occur if he hurt himself or was in
danger or sick or unwell.
Mr Weightman put to Ms D the two proposals by the parents, specifically that the
father’s primary position was that the
children spend time with him from a
Monday after school until the following Sunday at 5.00pm alternating fortnightly
in such fashion
and the mother’s primary position was that the children
spend time with the father from after school on Thursday until 5.00pm
alternate weekends, and given that both parents agreed to the children returning
at 5.00pm, Ms D was asked to consider
whether there was any advantage in the
father’s proposal over the mother’s proposal.
D considered there to be no benefit but more specifically, said that she did not
consider that for the children to spend time with
their father from after school
on Monday until the following Sunday would be in the children’s best
interests on the basis
that it was quite an extended period of time and is
different from the present arrangement, namely that the children spend time with
the father from after school Thursday until the resumption of school Monday
morning in alternate weeks.
D considered that on the basis of research, a week about was not in the best
interests in the children for the reason that they
need stability and
predictability and structure. When asked to consider the circumstances
pertaining to these parents and their difficulty
in communicating and the
particular matter in relation to [X] in relation to some hair product, Ms D said
clearly that she did not
wish to change her opinion of what she considered
appropriate.
cross examination by the father, Ms D was asked whether she would say
unequivocally that the children had not been coached
as to the views they had
expressed. Ms D said that in her opinion at that time there was no evidence that
either of the children
had been influenced.
father asked Ms D a number of questions which went to the issue of whether it
was appropriate parenting to give teenagers free
reign as to where they lived
from day to day or week to week or whether defined living arrangements were
preferable by providing
structure and stability. Ms D was unable to give a
specific answer as it depended upon a number of factors.
asked by the father what Ms D considered to be the children’s demeanour
and self confidence and maturity, she said she
would rate that quite high for
both children to which a number of factors would have contributed including
primary attachment figures,
extended family and temperament.
D agreed that the children had a close and loving bond with each other and when
asked by the father if it would be appropriate
for them to spend different or
separate periods of time with their parents, Ms D considered that given the ages
of these children
and the different views they had expressed, she found them to
be of a level of maturity to give their different expressed wishes
weight and it
was for that reason she had made the recommendations she had
asked by the father as to the basis upon which she had suggested the
father’s accommodation was not suitable for the children,
Ms D said that
it was a suggestion by her and not an assertion, and was not aware the children
shared a room in their mother’s
Dwyer asked Ms D whether, given that the children had expressed different views
as to their preferences for spending time with
him, and in particular that [X]
was content with the present arrangement whereas [Y] wanted to increase the
time, whether it would
be in everyone’s best interest to strike a balance
between the two proposals, perhaps by going down the middle in the fathers
D said “no” and that she had included in her report the very clear
wishes expressed by the children as to what they
wanted and which she considered
did not give rise to any issues. Ms D considered splitting down the middle was
not a consideration.
D added that she did not think it too complicated for the children to understand
or follow the suggestions the children had made.
response to a question from me as to Ms D’s evidence that it may not be
appropriate to impose specified time for [X] to spend
time with her father, and
whether there was a risk that if there was no specified time for [X] then it may
not occur, Ms D agreed
that such a risk was possible and with a further risk
that the father may accuse the mother of not releasing [X] which could cause
conflict and which then would impact upon the child, and that would be a
indicated that what I sometimes do in circumstances of this nature is make an
order requiring a child to spend a minimum specified
amount of time with the
other parent which could for example be one weekend per month as negotiated
between the child and the father.
Ms D considered that such a proposal would be
appropriate, and the same principal could be applied to holiday time which would
for a default period if negotiations were unsuccessful.
find on the evidence that the observations and recommendations of Ms D were not
the subject of any challenge by either the mother
or the father to warrant her
changing her opinion, save that there be some flexibility with the time [X]
spends with her father both
during school terms and holidays but with a
prescribed minimum period in each case in the absence of agreement. I therefore
the evidence and recommendations of the Family
Consultant.
father secured employment as a [omitted] in February 2012 based at [omitted] in
Newcastle and generally working approximately
38 hours per week but with varying
shifts. The father has completed his probationary period but at the time of the
hearing was not
yet on a permanent roster but anticipated being on a permanent
roster by the end of 2012.
father gave evidence that his work involves shift work, by far the greater part
of which, and something in the order of 90% is
from 7.00am on weekdays until
4.00pm. Occasionally, he is required to work a split shift between 6.00am and
6.00pm with a 4 or 5
hour break in the middle and occasionally he is required to
do a late shift starting at about 3.00pm and finishing at about midnight.
father’s evidence was to the effect that he had requested certain shifts
to accommodate his care of the children when they
have been with him pursuant to
the existing orders and that such requests have been successful.
father gave evidence that he proposes that his employment with [omitted] be long
term for the reason that it gives him certainty
of employment and some certainty
as to hours whereas his previous employment with [omitted] was contract based
with no stability
or certainty and little flexibility as to hours.
an employee of [omitted] the father thought he was entitled to
annual leave for which he had become eligible, as to part, at the time of the
leaves home at about 6.30am to be at the [workplace] in time for the 7.00am
shift. Occasionally, there is voluntary overtime for
which he can volunteer but
which is not compulsory.
father described a number of other special shifts which could be available to
him, for example starting at 10.00am and finishing
at 7.00pm or starting between
5.00am and 5.30am and finishing at 1.00pm and a number of other broken
father gave evidence in cross examination that in the past, when the children
had been staying with him on weekdays and he had
left for work at 6.30am, there
were two occasions when he asked the children to get themselves to school. The
father lives about
100 metres from [Y]’s school and [X] sometimes gets a
bus to school. The father said that he put appropriate measures in place
their security and was satisfied that they could look after themselves for a
short period.
father told Mr Weightman in cross examination that generally he arranged for his
mother to be at his home to care for the children
if he had gone to work. The
father qualified this evidence by adding that in his view, [X], given that she
will be 16 years of age
in March 2013 would be capable of caring for [Y] for a
short time.
father made it clear in cross examination if his application for the children to
stay with him fortnightly from after school on
Monday until Sunday night at
5.00pm was successful he would continue to work in a full-time capacity. The
father said that [omitted]
had afforded him some flexibility with his working
hours when he has been required to care for the children but that of course at
the present time is fortnightly from after school on Thursday until the
commencement of school the following Monday morning.
is no evidence before me upon which I can make any finding that the father will
continue to be afforded flexibility if the children
are living with him pursuant
to his application, namely 6 days and nights each fortnight. Indeed, the father
frankly conceded that
he did not expect [omitted] to accommodate him to the same
am satisfied however that the father will work as best he can to maximise the
time he is able to be with the children during those
periods when they will be
living with him.
father was cross examined as to what arrangements he would make to ensure the
children attended any extra-curricular activity
after school, whether sport,
employment or otherwise and I am satisfied on the father’s evidence that
he would ensure arrangements
were put into place if he was not able to take
either child himself to ensure continuity of attendance. The father identified a
friend to assist if necessary and the evidence establishes that the
parents have been able to assist each other in this respect when
at the time of the hearing, was employed at [omitted] at [M] on a permanent
part-time basis on a Tuesday, Friday and Saturday
afternoon. The evidence
establishes that each parent has been able to ensure she has been able to attend
this employment and be collected
at the end of her day.
father was cross examined in relation to an incident which occurred on the
morning of Monday 23 July 2012 when the father had
gone to work in the morning
and [X] missed the school bus but had the presence of mind to telephone her
mother who collected her
and took her to school. The father conceded that at the
time of that incident he had not discussed with [X] the arrangements to be
into place if she missed the school bus and said that a contingency plan had not
yet been formulated but it was something that
was going to be done.
father conceded in cross examination that he was angry at [X] for missing the
bus and that she had involved her mother because
it has painted him in a poor
light as a parent.
father conceded in cross examination that at the time of the hearing on 23
August he had not yet discussed with [X] any contingency
arrangement should a
similar event reoccur.
was left with the distinct impression from the manner in which the father gave
his evidence about this issue that whilst he would
not knowingly fail to make
appropriate care arrangements for the children when he is absent at work, he had
nevertheless given very
little consideration to the practical problems which may
arise in his absence and how they can be dealt with. The father conceded
not necessarily an easy option for him to be telephoned at work and he did not
intend to rely upon the mother. The father
made it clear that his preference
would be that she not walk to school, a distance of about 1.8 kilometres but it
was an option which
need not necessarily be ruled out. It would take her between
30 and 40 minutes.
father gave evidence, which I accept, that [X]’s bus is at about 8.00am
with [Y] leaving to walk to school at about 8.30am,
sometimes with the paternal
grandmother. The father said that [Y] had been left on his own for the ½
hour period on about 3
occasions. His mother lives not far from his home but
does not drive a motorcar and occasionally relies upon a walker device.
the Thursday and the Friday when the children are with their father, [Y] goes to
after school care on those days unless the father
is at home. The father gave
evidence, which I accept, that his mother is now at his home every day when the
children are with him
to ensure neither child is left alone.
father conceded that there had been two occasions when [Y] had signed himself
out of after school care and gone home but I am
satisfied on the father’s
evidence these were isolated occasions and that [Y] is of an age where he is
able to look after himself
for a short period of time.
the mother has some concerns about the children being left unattended although
she conceded in cross examination she had
also left them alone on rare
seems to me that the circumstances under which the children are left alone need
to be considered against a background of the reality
of a working parent
ensuring he or she is present for the majority of the time but catering for the
odd occasion when children of
this age may be left alone, or together for a
period probably not exceeding two hours, if that, and occasionally making their
to or from school. The reality must be weighed against the risk of anything
untoward occurring, and the risk, on the evidence before
me, is very slight.
parent suggests that any incident has occurred in which either child has exposed
himself or herself to danger or been exposed
to any danger beyond their
the evidence before me, the children present as mature, sensible and
responsible. That is not to say of course that they do not
need to be cared for
appropriately.
am satisfied that neither parent will willingly expose either child to any risk
and will ensure insofar as possible that appropriate
measures are in place at
is also appropriate in my view for children of this age to begin to explore
their own world to gain some feeling of independence
and responsibility.
to the children moving between the two homes, one of the issues raised by [X]
when she saw Ms R, a Family Consultant on 19 October
2011 was the ferrying of
copious amounts of personal items such as product for her hair. The father
conceded readily in cross examination
that it was an issue for [X] and was not
something that she had particularly enjoyed but that she now packs her own bag
and has not
made any recent complaint.
was evidence of an issue for [X] for not having a particular hair product of her
choice at a particular time when she was with
her father and the father conceded
that he had not asked her which particular brand she wanted so as to acquire it
for her. The father
said that [X]’s needs in this respect varied from
month to month and that he did not know which specific brand she wanted.
it was suggested to the father that if she was living in a week about
arrangement and that it could present a problem, the father
did not accept such
proposition and raised the issue of what would happen if he could not afford the
specific hair product she wanted
and would then suggest to her that they share
the cost based on the fact, in part that she is working. The father made it
his responses that he did not see this as a major issue and [X] did not
see it as an issue.
was left with the distinct impression from the tenor of the father’s
evidence in relation to this issue that he was likely
to see it more as one of
cost or potential cost rather than recognising [X]’s need at her age for
care products which she found
significant. The father’s admission that he
did not see it as a major issue but would consider it if it became an issue
perhaps that he is not as attuned as he could be to being sympathetic
with his daughter’s needs.
father conceded in cross examination that he had taken [X] to an abandoned
warehouse area in [M] with a view to introducing her
to the basic technique of
driving and controlling a motorcar. The father had taken [Y] as well. This
occurred just prior to the hearing
on a Sunday and continued for about ½
hour. The father conceded readily that [X] was not yet old enough to have a
permit but shortly is eligible to make application for her
“L” plates.
father’s evidence, which I accept, is that he had suggested this to [X]
and that she was welcoming of the idea. The father
considered that she was of an
age when she could start to appreciate what driving means and to get a feel for
it in preparation for
making application for her “L” plates.
father could not recall speaking to the mother about the proposal and I find, on
the evidence, that he did not do so and that
it was his decision.
father gave detailed evidence as to the site where the driving instruction
occurred. The father was asked whether he was concerned
that potentially it was
against the law for [X] to drive a motor vehicle without a learner’s
accept the father’s description of the area which he selected as being off
the public road in an abandoned warehouse area
known to the father and where
there were no other vehicles.
father described the vehicle he used as an old Magna Mitsubishi with an
automatic gearbox and that the driving by [X] comprised
driving around in
circles, the father showing her the safety features of the car followed by some
practice with steering to get a
feel for it. There was no suggestion of leaving
the chosen area. [Y] was not in the vehicle but nearby playing at some distance
father was asked whether he accepted that there was a potential risk of harm if
something completely unforseen had happened in
relation to the car. The father
did not accept such proposition. The father was asked what may have happened if
[X] had lost control
of the car which the father denied was a possibility both
because of the speed at which the vehicle was travelling, the fact that
professional [omitted] and was instructing her and with a handbrake within his
reach in the central console.
asked whether in retrospect the father should perhaps have raised that with the
mother he said that perhaps it would have been
a good idea but that he did not
always tell her what he was doing with the children and that he did not expect
her to do the same
and had complete trust in her most of the time.
asked by me whether he would still have taken her if he had raised if first with
the mother and she did not give her consent
or blessing, he said he did not know
but he may have just have gone ahead in any event.
is clear from the mother’s evidence she considered this to be
inappropriate and by inference is critical of the father for
doing so and sees
that as a failure in parental responsibility on his part.
seems to me that the mother is being somewhat overcautious in this respect and
that criticism of the father for doing this is not
reasoning is that the father, as he says, is a professional [omitted]. This is
not the first time he has worked for [omitted].
I am satisfied that the father
did not place [X] at any risk at all and closely supervised her first driving
lesson. In my view,
it is entirely appropriate to introduce a young person to a
vehicle in this fashion in a place where no other person or vehicle was
there was no risk of mishap on the evidence before me but if I am wrong, the
father was readily able to bring the vehicle
to a halt and there was no danger
seems to me there is a distinct advantage for a young person, before embarking
upon learning to drive a motor vehicle on public
roads to become familiar with
the basic controls for driving a car and an awareness of how to control by
steering, accelerating,
braking and learning how to use an automatic gearbox.
a motorcar has inherent risks, wherever it may be but I am satisfied that the
father took that into account properly and appropriately
and enabled his
daughter to experience for the first time becoming familiar with the operation
of a motorcar. Further there is no
evidence that any road traffic or other law
was infringed or broken by either [X] or her father.
to the father’s accommodation, he rents a shop which has been converted
into a residence and of which he drew a sketch plan
as to the facilities and
accommodation
father described in detail in cross examination the sleeping arrangements that
provide that [X] has her own room and space and
that [Y] generally shares
bedroom space with the father and that his mother when she is staying overnight
sleeps in what is normally
[Y]’s room. On some occasions, the father and
[Y] share the same bed when the paternal grandmother is staying, otherwise he
has separate living space within the premises.
father gave evidence that he did not intend this to be permanent accommodation
but that it is something that he can afford at
the present time and that he
considers appropriate for the time the children spend with him.
father said that if his application for virtual equal shared time was successful
he would have to find different and larger accommodation.
father conceded that his present accommodation is within his budget and is the
best he can afford at the present time.
the evidence, I find that the father’s present home is not optimal
accommodation for the children whether they are spending
four days a fortnight
with their father or longer periods. It is not in [Y]’s best interests to
share a bed with his father.
Whilst there is no complaint from [Y] about such
event, it seems to me that it is essential for proper rest and sleeping given
father’s work hours and the time he leaves for work both the father
and [Y] will benefit from undisturbed sleep. Whilst there
is no direct evidence
produced before me of either the father or [Y] suffering from broken sleep, it
seems to me inevitable upon
the balance of probabilities that this arrangement
needs to be addressed by the father by, for example, requiring a separate bed
for [Y], which perhaps could be placed elsewhere within the accommodation.
the father had been in his present employment, for some months and did not
suggest in his evidence that his salary was likely
to increase in the near
the father acknowledged that if his application was successful he would require
larger accommodation he conceded that nothing
was about to change with his
financial circumstances but he hoped to find something a little better and not
much more expensive.
the father pays $215.00 a week rent and that from enquires he had made expected
to pay within $270.00 and $320.00 for larger
accommodation and encompassing the
suburbs of [W], [L] and [omitted]. He had occupied his present home for about
twelve months.
to use of telephones, both children have mobile phones with the mother paying
for [X]’s and the father pre-paying for [Y]’s
for fixed periods and
in respect of which the father does not expect [Y] to exhaust his credit on the
basis that the father has introduced
very direct and clear ground rules for [Y]
for the use of the telephone. The prepaid period lasts for three months.
father gave evidence that [Y] has told his father that the credit has run out
and the father had made it clear to him that it
will not be renewed until the
three month period has expired.
father also has a landline at home which the children are able to use.
evidence suggests the telephone communication between each of the children and
the parents is without difficulty.
evidence establishes that communication between the parents is somewhat poor and
may not be capable of resolution although it
is equally clear there are some
matters about which they are able to co-operate with parenting
arrangements.
evidence suggests, and I find on the balance of probabilities, that household
financial circumstances has been a festering sore
for many years with the father
adopting the view that the mother is prone to excess and indulgence particularly
so far as concerns
education of the children and the mother adopting the view
that the father is unwilling to spend money and borders on being miserly.
Inevitably,
this has led to some mistrust. The father illustrated the poor communication by
his assertion that the mother did not
talk to him about [X] being able to enjoy
an overseas trip to India when she was fourteen and there was an application for
a passport.
The mother asserts that she told the father when she became aware of
the event and before the event. The father recalled [X] had
talked to him
briefly about the possibility of going to India on a Church trip some eighteen
months prior to the event but nothing
it was suggested to the father that it would not be possible for the mother to
take [Y] abroad unless both parents sign a passport
application for him, the
father said, somewhat surprisingly that he thought it was a possibility that the
mother could forge his
signature on a passport application for [Y]. When it was
put to the father that the mother had done nothing, to his knowledge of
fraudulent nature, he said:
can say with equivocation, no or that I can prove.”
father conceded in response to a question from me that there was no proper basis
to think it was a possibility that the mother
could forge his signature.
is this lack of trust which seems to me flows more likely than not from the
inability of the parents to communication about some
issue which has given rise to a degree of mistrust is the father’s fear
that the mother will leave Australia permanently
and move with the children to
Guatemala where her father lives and who is divorced from her biological
Weightman suggested to the father that the mother has considerable ties in
Australia with her employment, her home, teenage children
being educated at
private schools in accordance with her preference and put simply, very
considerable community ties that would preclude
the real possibility of the
mother leaving the country with the children to settle abroad.
father’s response to such proposition was that his research into the
possibility of parents taking children from the country,
even though they may
have ties and connections does not prevent them from doing something to keep the
children from the other parent.
asked by me whether he thought that the mother’s ties in Australia were
insufficient to prevent her from moving to Guatemala,
the father acknowledged
such ties but that they were not strong enough to prevent her leaving Australia
and that he believed it was
possible that she would go anyway.
is concerning that the father adduced no evidence at all in his case from which
I could make any finding that the mother is likely
to leave Australia with the
children to live in Guatemala.
father’s responses to the matters put to him about this issue are more
indicative of a perception that the mother is trying
to frustrate his
relationship with the children when the evidence is to the contrary. Further, Ms
D formed a clear opinion that the
preferences expressed by each child appeared
not to have been influenced by either of the
is unfortunate that the father has adopted such a jaundiced view against the
mother which colours his perception of her and which,
if reality tested by him
ought to lead him to the conclusion that his lack of trust and suspicion is
misplaced and no doubt contributes
to the poor communication between them
concerning those matters about which they do not agree.
to the father’s financial circumstances, he gave evidence that his gross
annual pay is between $48,000.00 and $49,000.00
and that deducted from his gross
pay is income tax, union fees, instalments for a tax debt and a student loan
outgoings include hire purchase of $25.00 a week with an outstanding debt of
day ordinary recurring
household expenditure, a personal loan with Westpac for which he pays $90.00 per
week with an outstanding
balance of about $5,500.00 and his Child Support
Assessment currently in an amount of $583.83 per
period 1 October 2011 to 31 December 2012 which the father anticipates will
increase consequent upon his increase in pay.
father pays $25.00 per week to [P] School when he is able to as a contribution
toward accrued and unpaid fees. His assets comprise
shares worth about
$1,500.00, superannuation and a motor car.
to the education of the children, it is the father’s clearly stated wish
that he would like the children to remain at their
present schools until the end
of 2013, that is [X] remaining at [S] School until the conclusion of Year 10 and
[Y] at [C] School
until the end of Year 6 which therefore completes his primary
education before moving to a high school.
response to questions concerning [X]’s schooling for Years 11 and 12, the
father said that he had spoken to [X] about her
wish to go to [F] School, that
she had told him it is a feeder school from her present school, [S] School and
that she does not want
to go to [P] School. The father confirmed that [X] had
again expressed the same wish about [F] School some three or four months prior
to the hearing.
father said that [X] had also mentioned [U] School for Years 11 and 12, and
which is also a Catholic School but the father could
not confirm if he knew,
from his own knowledge that [U] School catered for Years 11 and 12 students. The
father said also that [X]
had told him that she does not want to go to [P]
School but he could not recall when she said this.
asked by Mr Weightman if the father accepted her wish to go to [F] School, the
father accepted that that is what [X] reported
to Ms D but then
we don’t have to give everything to our children that they express a wish
asked, apart from the issue of finance, whether he would prevent [X] from going
to [F] School if that is her preferred choice
the father said:
necessarily.”
father emphasised that [X] told him that she wanted to go to [F] School both
because it is a feeder school and because all her
friends from [S] School would
be going there but that there was a costs element to be considered as it was an
independent school.
father said that both children knew that he did not have the capacity to fund
private schooling, and that he had suggested other
schools to them, including
[M] School which it is acknowledged is a selective State High School.
the father was asked by Mr Weightman whether he accepted that the mother was
willing to pay private school fees he said:
I’m not accepting that. It hasn’t been proven. There is no evidence
to suggest she can afford it. That’s
why I asked for the subpoena. So
I’m not accepting that because it hasn’t been physically said that
she will take responsibility
for that if she wants it for the
it was put to the father that the mother had been paying the greater part of the
school fees since 2010 for [X] at [S] School
and [Y] at [C] School the father
conceded that was the case but understood she benefited from a discount or
received a subsidy, about
which he did not have any problem.
the father was asked whether he had any objection to the children continuing to
attend private schools, the father said:
I don’t but as long as she can prove she can meet them because I’m
not having this family again being forced
into debt or financial hardship
because of private school fees. And even though we are separated, we are still a
family. Our kids
are the subject children here, OK so no, I don’t provided
she can verify it and validate it.”
was put to the father by Mr Weightman that [Y] had indicated a preference to go
to [P] School rather than continue at [C]
the father became aware when he read the Family Report.
father did not rule out [P] School as an option for [Y] and he is not opposed to
the school, but for the cost.
father conceded that he would take some comfort as to the children attending
private schools if the Court made an order to the
effect that the mother was
solely responsible for all private school fees and that on that basis he would
not have any difficulty
with them remaining in their present schools until the
end of 2013.
mother gave evidence that she has a current liability to [P] School for unpaid
school fees of a little more than $1,700.00 which
she is paying, by arrangement
at the rate of $25.00 per week when she can afford to do so and more if she can
afford to do so.
mother also gave evidence that following discussions with the Principal at [P]
School, the school would not object to either child
being enrolled at [P] School
whilst there were earlier unpaid school fees.
mother gave evidence that school fees for [X] to attend [S] School were about
$1,800.00 after the subsidy had been taken into
account and that she paid extra
for excursions with an additional amount of between $300.00 and $500.00 each
year for other school
expenses including excursions, equipment, additional books
and stationary and similar items.
mother said that whilst she was a little behind with the fees for [X] at [S]
School the school was not insisting upon any immediate
mother said that the fees for [Y] at [C] School were about $2,000.00 a year
after taking into account the discount, and that [Y]’s
school fees are up
the second day of hearing, the mother confirmed the school fee liabilities as
$1,793.08 for [P] School and $2,055.60 for [X] at
[S] School during 2012 and a
credit of $488.20 as at July 2012 for [Y] at [C]
. The mother
explained that the [C] School account is in credit consequent upon her mother
contributing some school fees in 2011.
asked by the father as to the future proposal to which the mother deposed that
she would like the choice to return the children
the children in the Catholic school system the mother confirmed her preference
as to the latter but rather that there
be an option to go back to [P]
the mother’s earlier evidence, I am left with the distinct impression that
she is content for [X] to attend [F] School
from 2014 and for [Y] to attend [S]
School for his secondary education.
asked by the father why the mother was seeking sole responsibility for the
children’s education the mother said:
of the way you removed them from [P] School. It was very distressing on the
children. And the fact that you keep telling
the children that they are going to
public school also upsets them.”
asked why the mother thought private schooling was better for the children as
opposed to public schooling the mother considered
that in general terms it was a
nurturing environment, there were more advantages and discipline was strict and
additional matters
can be delivered to them which the mother considered
important because both children are smart and both need a gifted stream.
asked by the father whether the mother made sound and more rational decisions
concerning the children’s education than
he did, the mother thought that
she did because the children’s education was very important to her, and
more important than
the cost and that she had been very active in attending
interviews, activities and functions as well as school excursions.
asked by me as to how the mother proposed to pay the continuing school fees for
[X] and [Y] the mother said that in the future
she proposed to have full time
stable employment and to enter into a payment plan with [S] School for both
children. The mother considered
full time employment which she anticipated
obtaining by Christmas that she could earn between $700.00 and $800.00 per week.
considered that without full time employment she would be struggling
to pay the school fees.
mother said that she anticipated receiving a legacy from her late mother’s
estate, and something in the order of $250,000.00
and that the assets to be
realised to enable the beneficiaries to be paid should be completed in about 8
-12 months that is by August
2013 at the latest following the sale of a home and
some shares. The mother gave specific evidence that it was from such legacy that
she proposed the school fees be met.
father has no objection to either child attending [P] School, except for the
cost. In that context, the father meant not only
the school fees but the levies
and extra items of expenditure, for example excursions, uniforms, books and the
asked by Mr Weightman whether it was fair to say that if the mother paid private
school fees including any levies or charges
then the father did not have any
problem with the children continuing to attend a private school the father
per se, no, but I still maintain that I do not want them moved – I do not
want any school changes until they have
finished their current schooling to the
end of 2013.”
to schooling from 2014, the father said that he did not object to them attending
a private school but that he could not afford
to pay private school fees, adding
that if it was to be a private school, it had to be the right school for the
was clarified with Mr Weightman that whilst the mother did not seek a specific
order that she be responsible for school fees it
was implicit in her application
that she recognised an obligation to pay the school fees in the absence of the
father paying by virtue
of having sole parental responsibility for the issue of
this, I clarified with the father and he confirmed that it was his position that
if the mother pays the school fees and levies
and subject to the children being
able to transfer to a private school then he had no objection to the children
attending a private
school in the Newcastle district but it was not subject to
and he did not agree with the mother having sole responsibility for
of the orders sought by the father, order 11 in his outline of case document is
as follows:
mother is restrained and injuncted from leaving the children alone in the
presence of the person known to both parties
Ms C, or to allow Ms
C to collect or drop the children from or to their schools or social engagements
(Identity of Ms C suppressed
to protect privacy of third
his evidence in chief, in response to questions from me, the father identified
such person as Ms C whom he considered to be a person
instrumental in some part
to the breakdown of the marriage but is not related to either party or the
children, at some stage was
a family friend of the mother’s, and the
father said he perceived as a psychological and perhaps a physical threat to the
cross examination, the father said, in relation to Ms C that he had some concern
in relation to such person causing risk to the
children but that he did not know
whether such person was still involved with the mother’s life adding that
he needed to have
an order there just in case she is.
father conceded that he had no evidence from the children or any indication from
them that they have come into contact with Ms
C in recent times.
find on the evidence before me that there is no justification whatsoever to make
the order sought by the father in relation to Ms
C. Quite simply, there is no
evidence at all to warrant such an order.
further order sought by the father and found in paragraph 10 of his draft
minutes of proposed orders is an order in the following
mother is restrained and injuncted from effecting a change to the
children’s surname without the father’s
is no evidence before me upon which I can make any finding of fact that the
mother has or intends to change the surname for
either child. Further, the
father adduces no evidence in his case that the surname for either child has
been changed.
cross examination, the father gave evidence that [X]’s facebook name has
changed a number of times with the father asserting
that [X] had done this with
her mother’s consent and permission for the purpose of protecting her
said that various names had been used including
[omitted] which is the mother’s maiden name.
father was unable to say whether [X] has been doing this of her own volition and
the father readily conceded that he had no indication
from the mother at all
that she proposed to change the surname of either child.
those reasons, I find there is no evidence whatsoever of any proposal by the
mother or indeed the father to change the surname
of either child. Consequently,
the injunction the father seeks is not warranted or justified and I decline to
make such an order.
father gave evidence in cross examination, consistent with his application that
his time with the children should cease at 5.00pm
on the Sunday and which, in
his view, should apply to both children. The father said his reason for seeking
such an order was that
[X] had expressed a concern that she wanted to go home
Sunday nights.
father’s evidence is that [Y] has not expressed such a wish although
occasionally both children had gone back to the mother’s
Sunday night at their request but on no more than one or two occasions.
father was very clear to say that he did not want to split the children and he
did not want to have orders which would have that
asked by me whether he had taken into account [Y]’s expressed wish to Ms D
in particular that he would like to spend more
time with the father and go back
on Tuesday morning, the father said that he had given that consideration but
that he was trying
to strike a balance between the wishes of both children and
in particular that [X] had said that she preferred to go back Sunday
she could be ready for school on the Monday morning.
father considered however the underlying reason for [X] making this request was
that if she was with her mother on the Monday
morning then her mother would take
her to school which negated the need for [X] to catch a bus which the father
considers she does
not enjoy. The father said also that the mother does not
encourage [X] to catch a bus.
father told me that he had not mentioned to either [X] or [Y] that it was his
preferred position, and application that they go
father said that he was proposing to ask Ms D some questions about this
particular issue.
was not a matter raised by the father with Ms D.
Mr Weightman suggested to the father that he had obviously put some considerable
thought into the issue of the children going
Sunday night, the father said, somewhat surprisingly:
father said that he understood that there is an obvious age gap between [X] and
[Y], which in fact is four years, and that they
are developing different
interests, especially with [X] working in her part time job and spending more
time with friends in her peer
group as compared with [Y].
was suggested to the father that given the age differential and their developing
different interests there was no longer a case
in which, for example, two young
children would be accompanied by their parents all the time, to which the father
responded he took
them everywhere he could together.
Weightman asked the father whether, given that [X] attains the age of 16 years
in March 2013 he thought it necessary for the Court
to make specific orders for
[X] to spend time with him both during school terms and school holidays.
Initially, the father queried
the relevance of such a question. Following my
explanation to him that it is very relevant because of the law I am required to
and the evidence as to the children’s maturity and their state of
mind the father said:
children normally get split up? I am sorry, but it strikes me as very odd that a
Court would rule two different orders
for two different aged children when the
whole purpose of the
Family Law Act
is to try and keep families as stable as
considered it necessary to give an explanation to the father, informing him that
each case is extremely individual and that there
is no general rule or general
plan. The outcome depends upon the children, their parents, other significant
adults, domestic circumstances
and a whole range of things.
question was put to the father again as to whether he thought it was an
appropriate order, as sought by the mother for [X] that
she be at liberty to
spend time with the father whenever she likes, but at the same time as [Y] and
without a specific order for
certain times and dates.
father said unhesitatingly he did not think it was appropriate and when asked
as I stated in my affidavit, my parenting extends beyond one child and the
involvement that I want to have with my
children extends beyond one child. You
can quite comfortably do separate things with each other when they’re
together. As you
said, they have different needs. Well, I try to accommodate
both their needs when they’re both with me. But I also want the
opportunity for them to be together, to participate in joint activities
together, like seeing extended family, for example or like
going away on a
weekend, so if [X] was able to choose whether she was coming to my place or not,
she might miss out on those things.”
asked, given [X]’s age, whether the father thought it appropriate that was
something she should decide, the father said:
I don’t. I don’t.”
the father was asked whether he thought that that was perhaps part of her
growing up and gaining of maturity that she should
start making those decisions
herself, the father said:
I think she should participate in social activities with her peers and ask but I
don’t think we should give her
carte blanche as to what decisions she
makes, where she wants to go, who she wants to be with. She’s still a
child. She’s
still a minor. We still have an obligation as parents to have
some boundaries for her.”
father was asked by Mr Weightman what he thought may happen if his application
was successful for a week about arrangement for
both children and [X] said at
some stage during 2013 that she did not want such an arrangement. The father was
asked what he would
do and the father said:
have thought about that. I don’t know to be honest. I don’t know
what the answer to that would be and it has
certainly happened. It certainly
happens. It has happened to a friend of mine with his daughter. It has happened
to another friend
that the daughter just keeps going backwards and forwards
between the residences. I don’t want that for our kids. I don’t
that because I think that’s them controlling us as parents. I don’t
want that situation where they control where
they live and where they want to
be. I think, you know, we’re still their parents, we have to set the rules
or the Court, in
this case.”
asked by me whether it was the father’s application that both children be
returned to the mother on the Sunday night at
5.00pm if it were my decision that
a week about arrangement was not appropriate, the father said:
I acknowledge that that probably is best for them, that return on a Sunday night
but as I said, that has come after conversations
I put to the father what he would propose if it was the decision of the Court
that the children should spend alternate weekends
with him or something like
that, and whether that should start after school on the Thursday or after school
on the Friday and for
both children or for only one of them, the father
don’t want to split them.”
asked by me, given that the father had put no alternative proposal to the Court
other than the Tuesday to Sunday to which I have
referred, and whether, it was
something similar to the present regime and with my asking the father whether it
should be from after
school on Thursday or after school on Friday if it is to be
alternate weekends the father said:
because that does not reduce my current time with them and it would be Wednesday
to Sunday.”
father said that under that arrangement, both children should stay with him,
adding that if there was a sporting activity on the
Wednesday or the Thursday,
as [Y] sometimes has, then he would make arrangements for him to attend such
activity or perhaps the mother
could take him.
mother sought orders that the father pay half of all dental and optometrist
expenses for both children and, with the exception
of visits to General
Practitioners that the father pay half of all medical expenses for the
mother also sought an order that the father pay half of all driving related
expenses including driving lessons for both children
when learning to drive and
that the father pay the mother for half the costs associated with each of the
children attending sporting
and extra-curricular activities and to be paid
within fourteen days of receiving the tax invoice or receipt from the mother.
father said very clearly that he could afford none of the expenses sought by the
father gave evidence that he contributes to a medical health benefits fund for
the children and himself, namely Bupa but only
for ambulance cover. The father
did not know if the mother had medical benefits insurance for the children.
asked how he would pay if he was obliged to take the children, for example, to a
dentist he said that he would try and negotiate
some payment plan with the
father says that since separation, in February 2010 he had been required to take
the children only to a GP. The father also said
that he would meet the medical
costs for the children during the times they are with him and he would find a
way to do so and if
necessary, would go into debt. The father emphasised that he
would never neglect the children’s medical needs, and I accept
question was posed to the father if [X], for example asked him to contribute to
the cost of one of her driving lessons. The father
said that was something that
he and the mother should discuss.
ventured to the father that I could not be confident that he and the mother
could discuss anything constructively with a view to
reaching an agreement about
meeting costs for the children as a consequence of their financial
circumstances.
father’s response was that at some point he and the mother would have to
communicate about such things, and when such an
issue arose he did not think he
and the mother could expect their daughter not to have confidence that her
parents could not get
together and agree on a sum between them that they could
both afford.
I pointed out that on the material before me as to costs of schooling, thus far
it was likely that I would find that the ability
of the father and the mother,
firstly to talk with each other, secondly for such talks to be constructive and
third then agree is
almost nil the father said:
don’t know what the solution to that is.”
asked by me as to how I could have any confidence that something is going to
change between the parents and they will be able
to talk and reach an agreement,
the father posed the question of how it could be ordered when both the parents
have such a problem.
father gave further evidence in response to Mr Weightman that if such medical
expenses were incurred he would accept the responsibility
for them and also
accepted that there was a possibility of greater expense if the children were
living week about. The father thought
that perhaps his present child support
liability may be reduced but had made no enquires of the Child Support Agency.
father’s evidence in relation to medical expenses in cross examination is
inconsistent with the orders he seeks.
paragraph 7 of his draft minutes of proposed orders the father suggests that the
parents each bear the costs of minor medical expenses
under $50.00 for the
children whilst the children are in their care, including but not limited to
visits to GP, prescriptions and
father also
medical expenses over $50.00 should be shared equally by the parents by way of
the parent who incurred the cost making a written
request with documentary
evidence to the other parent and the other parent remitting payment within 30
days to the encumbered parent.
am left with the distinct impression after listening to the father’s
evidence concerning the time the children should be returned
to the mother and
meeting of medical expenses that the father idealises some aspects of his role
as a parent and his relationship
with the children and perceives his role as a
parent to be that of an authority figure with a somewhat rigid approach to the
the children should spend with him and which denies the children,
particularly [X], the flexibility she needs, now as a 16 year old
illustrated by the evidence of Ms D.
to medical expenses I am quite sure the father believes sincerely that he will
be able to meet the medical expenses which he perceives
he may be required to
meet if I make an order in accordance with his draft minutes of proposed orders,
or any expense which he incurs
when the children are with him and there is no
such order. Against that, I must view the father’s evidence as to his
to meet these expenses with some circumspection having regard to his
evidence concerning his financial circumstances.
is illustrative of the idealistic manner in which I perceive the father
approaches his parenting role that he could not conceive
that the children would
be able to be separated whilst spending time with him and that [X] could go back
to the mother’s at
5.00pm on the Sunday evening and [Y] could stay until
the Tuesday morning.
that may be an ideal arrangement, and certainly that is the manner in which the
father perceives not splitting the children,
it denies [Y] the time that he
would clearly like to spend with his father and which I find on the evidence
would be meaningful and
a positive benefit for [Y].
is clear the father has much to offer both children and in my view, [Y] should
be given that opportunity to spend additional time
with his father.
consequence for [Y] if I were to make such an order and the father ignored it
may well have potentially serious adverse consequences
for [Y]. First, he may
perceive that his father is rejecting him and does not want to spend time with
him second, he may perceive
he is denied the opportunity to spend time alone
with his father without his sister which may give rise to some resentment toward
his father. Equally, [Y] could be resentful toward his sister if he thought that
he could spend time with his father only when his
sister was there.
is also illustrative of perhaps the father’s ideal perception of parenting
that he is not prepared to entertain [X] making
a choice as to how much time she
spends with him.
find on the evidence that this approach by the father, especially in light of Ms
D’s evidence is too rigid and fixed, although
no doubt well intentioned.
The risk the father runs as to his relationship with [X], given her age and
maturity, which is not challenged
on the expert evidence before me is that he
will alienate her if she is compelled to follow rigid orders.
father was frank in his evidence when he said to Mr Weightman that he did not
know what he would do if [X] was resistant to a
week about order and declined to
comply, and the same argument applies to any other period [X] is required to
spend with the father
pursuant to orders. Again, the father seems to have an
ideal view of his role as a father which has not been tempered with the reality
of a 16 year old now well advanced on the process of individuation and wanting
to spend more time with her peers as she grows into
young adulthood and prefers
to find her own feet to make her way forward.
mother gave evidence that in her present casual employment as a [omitted] her
net take home pay varies upon the number of hours
of work but ranges between
$400.00 - $600.00 per week but on average between $480.00 - $500.00. The mother
also receives some Centrelink
benefits including Family Tax Benefit and
Newstart. The Family Tax Benefit is about $329.00 a fortnight and Newstart is
depending upon the number of hours she works but up to $480.00 a

mother confirmed that she budgeted carefully with no surplus funds at the end of
the week after meeting ordinary recurring expenditure
and the support of the
children and some contributions towards accrued liabilities. The evidence does
not establish that the father
should be required to contribute to any further
expenses the mother incurs for the children.
cross examination by the father, and when asked to give a specific example of
when the mother asserted the father has lied
mother said:
has lied to the children about when I was to have the kids. He has lied to the
children about comments I have made in the
past. There was an example and [X]
actually told me that he lied about facebook to someone else. He has lied about
where he has been
on numerous occasions, not always with the children, no. He
lied about spending Christmas with them and there are probably numerous
ones that I really cannot remember every single
father conceded he has lied to the children about Santa Claus and the Tooth
fairies but had no recollection of the various other
allegations that the mother
evidence does not enable me to establish whether the father has lied as the
mother asserts but it is indicative of a degree of
lack of trust by the mother
of the father.
mother gave evidence in cross examination that she is able, as a consequence of
her work hours, to collect both children from
school, which she does and also
takes them to school in the morning. The mother said that very occasionally she
had to take [X] to
school early and also dropped [Y] off at a friend’s
place to enable him to walk to school with their children.
mother was critical of the father as to some aspects of his parenting of the
children, in particular the occasions upon which
[Y] had signed himself out of
school care and walked home along a busy street, and another time when he had
allowed [X] to go into
town with people and just wander around with no defined
mother gave evidence as to the two occasions upon which [X] had telephoned her
from the father’s home to collect her to
take her to school, the first
occasion occurred when she had missed the bus and the other occasion occurred
when it was raining and
she told her mother she did not have a jumper.
mother said that she had not told the father about these incidents because [X]
begs her not to because she is worried as to how
her father would react. The
mother said that she had arranged for a friend to collect [X] from home as she
was at work at the time.
mother conceded that given that both parents worked, it was not always possible
for the parents to be home for the children and
the mother further conceded that
it was sometimes necessary for a contingency plan to be put into place.
emerged during cross examination by the father that the mother had also made
arrangements on one or two occasions for [Y] to leave
school with friends and
travel by bus to their home at [omitted] from which she then collected him.
asked by the father what the mother thought was wrong as to the current
arrangements for the children and the structure and routine,
the mother said
there was a problem with school uniforms and with the children taking things
from the family home to the father’s
a problem with sports. The mother agreed that the father returned all their
items to her home
on a Monday evening, fortnightly.
was left with the distinct impression from the tenor of the mother’s
evidence in response to these questions that the mother
was not embracing the
necessity for there to be some adaptation when children are moving between two
that on some occasions items or clothing
will be left behind or forgotten and require delivery or collection.
mother agreed that both children would stay at their present schools until the
end of 2013 and when asked what her preference
for [X] was for 2014 the mother
would presume she would stay and go on to [F] School. She made a few comments
to me about going to [P] School, but I’m
presuming that she will stay in
the Catholic stream.”
asked whether it was her preference that [X] go to [F] School the mother
really don’t mind which private school they go to, they both just have a
problem with Catholicism. Because we go to
a Christian church –
we’re Christians, so I really don’t know much about [F] School. I
know it has got a good curriculum
for going to
university.”
asked as to her preference for [Y] in 2014 the mother said:
I’m presuming he will go to [S] School as well. He has got a very strong
desire to go back to [P] School. I really
don’t mind if he stays in the
Catholic stream or he goes back to [P] School.”
mother conceded that on rare occasions she had left the children at home alone
when she had not been able to obtain time off from
work, and she thought was
acceptable if both children were home together but that [Y] was not yet old
enough to be left alone.
asked as to [X]’s driving lesson and whether the mother considered the
father to be a competent driver, the mother did
not agree with such proposition
and said the father had been fined on numerous occasions for not wearing his
seatbelt, sitting too
close to the car in front of him and did not turn his head
but used the mirrors instead.
the mother was critical of the father in this respect, the evidence does not
enable me to make any finding as to whether such
assertions are true and it is
not a matter about which the father adduced any further evidence.
asked by the father why she objected to him giving [X] basic, safe and
controlled driving lesions, the mother said:
she is under the legal age to carry a learner’s permit. It is against the
law and I don’t think it is
instilling in her about laws, about abiding
laws and doing the right thing by society.”
the father suggested to the mother that they could both contribute to
instructing [X] and [Y] in basic driving technique and
which would be positive
for each of them when considering the costs of teaching their children to drive
the mother said:
because I think being taught by an authorised instructor, is well worth the
money to keep her alive. We all know we get
bad habits and I am not going to
try and teach her to drive without any paid lessons because I have bad habits
and I want her to
live and survive on the road when she
mother said that she would give [X] driving lessons after she had had a few
lessons with an instructor.
asked why she considered [X] took a lot of personal property to and fro between
the respective homes the mother said:
you don’t supply the things that she requires. Such as deodorant, personal
hygiene products, clothes, school
uniform, sports shoes, hair products, razors,
are just a few, lunch box and drink bottle.”
mother acknowledged that [X] was very specific about what she wore, the makeup
she used and the beauty products that she also
used and further agreed that [X]
evidence given by the mother as to the need for her to supply [X] with the
personal possessions, care and hygiene products and
other personal property as
described by her above is not refuted or put in issue by the father. The mother
made a very similar observation
in her affidavit sworn 27 July
mother also deposed to the children having told her that when either of them
have asked their father for certain things like a
hair trim, a book or clothes
the father tells them that the mother should buy those items as he (the father)
gives the mother more
than enough money. This evidence is also subject to
challenge by the father, and by inference, he is referring to his Child Support
further illustration of the mother’s criticism of the father in this
respect arose from an incident just prior to the hearing
when [X], was with the
father, requested some particular shampoo and conditioner as a consequence of
not being able to wash her hair
for a week, which it seems flowed from minor
surgery she had. [X] requested the mother take such items around to her, which
and the father, during cross examination asked the mother, in relation
to this incident as to what had prompted her to drop everything
and give in to
[X]’s demands asking the mother whether it was a life or death situation
or whether it was really important
mother said in response:
was important to her and I was sitting at home, I was not doing anything and I
didn’t feel it was going to hurt.”
find on the balance of probabilities that the mother has supplied the greater
part of the children’s personal property, clothing
and effects and which,
of necessity, they take with them each time they spend time with their father
and then take home with them.
It seems to me that this is a perfectly proper
arrangement given the financial constraints which affect both parents. I find on
evidence that this is not a case where the parents would be able to afford
to duplicate all items of clothing, uniforms, personal
effects and hygiene
products and the like in each home. More significantly, I find it is not
seems to me that the most likely explanation for each parents criticism of the
other in relation to these issues, and there is
evidence before me that the
father purchases some items for daily use by the children, is found in their
dislike of each other and
permitting these issues to take on a disproportionate
weight as compared with the reality of two children moving between two homes
taking necessary personal effects, clothing and the like to and fro.
to the mother’s accommodation for the children, she conceded readily that
both children continue to share the same bedroom
which has continued since
separation in February 2010 but have separate beds on opposite sides of the
room, and that they share a
wardrobe with drawers and shelves.
mother agreed with the father that it was not ideal for the children to continue
to share a bedroom given their genders and age
but the mother gave no evidence
that she proposed to change such arrangements.
relation to the mother’s application that the father pay equally dental
and optometrist expenses, the mother said that she
had currently paid such
amounts and that she had purchased one pair of glasses for [X] during 2011 or
2010 at a cost of $179.00 and
that she was again due for an eyesight test. As to
dental costs, she said that the children’s teeth are in good condition and
there is no immediate anticipated expense. The mother does not contribute to any
medical benefits fund for the children.
mother also said that she did not anticipate any immediate medical
asked by me as to why the mother was asking for an order that [X] spend
unspecified time with her father the mother said:
now that she’s working, and also her social life, and she has church camps
and other activities, her father
doesn’t always agree to these –
allowing her to go to these things. At this age, a lot of them are important
and just recently, she was quite sick and she just said to me
“Mum, I just want to stay here, and just lie in bed and watch
the telly I
don’t want to go to Dad’s” but she had to go. Just to give
her that option, but I still want her to
go with [Y]. I want that option if
something comes up.”
asked by me what the mother considered were the father’s good parenting
qualities and what he offered them in that capacity
know that he loves the kids. I just find that difficult to answer. Because
it’s so open ended. I’m not sure.”
asked by me whether the mother considered the children’s relationship with
the father is important to them she said:
that’s why I’ve never stopped him having the kids. And I tell [X],
and I told [Y] that “Your father
loves you” and so it is important
for them to have a relationship with their father.”
asked by me as to what qualities the mother thought the father possessed to make
him a good parent to the children, and by way
of illustration I suggested
honesty, pride in the community, attention to homework, importance of schooling,
importance of attending
church, being law abiding, doing the right thing, not
taking drugs, drinking alcohol and a whole host of other things that one might
consider in that capacity the mother said:
Well, look, I don’t think he deliberately – I don’t think he
would deliberately go out of his way
to harm them or hurt them. It’s very
difficult to answer. I mean, when he takes them driving, that’s
irresponsible,
and that worries me, he’s just showing irresponsible ways.
I’m just feeling at the moment that when he lets them just
wander, I just
get worried.”
mother agreed that she considered the father may have some liberal ideas with
which she did not agree.
asked by me what criticism she would make of the father she
just feel that he does what he wants with the kids, not necessarily what’s
in their best interests or what they would
like to do. I just feel that he just
doesn’t protect them enough, and when they have a problem that they are
unhappy with,
they would tell me about it and I say “well, why don’t
you tell your father?” and they say “he doesn’t
listen or he
gets angry””.
asked by me as to what she considered to be her good qualities as a parent, the
mother said that she was consistent, she knows
what the children are doing and
where they are, she knows [X]’s friends and parents and likewise with [Y]
and that she makes
sure they know what the laws are and obey the laws and have
respect for other people and have manners which she thought was really
asked by me whether the mother thought she had any poor qualities as a parent
upon which she wanted to improve she said:
I don’t always listen. I jump in on them if they’re talking
sometimes and don’t let them finish a sentence.
Sometimes, everything
that’s going at the moment, I’m not really present with them. I feel
that sometimes I actually
neglect their needs. Not deliberately, but just with
everything going on. I get angry sometimes.”
asked by me what discussion the mother had with [Y] about his preference to go
to [P] School, the mother again confirmed that
he would probably follow [X] and
go to [S] School and that she should probably been firmer with him and told him
that it was not
really an option to go back to [P] School. The mother thought
that might have unsettled him a bit but she had said to him recently,
that he probably would not be able to go back to [P] School and he needs to
remain settled in his present stream at [C]
School to go on to [S] School.
mother said that [Y] was not upset about such proposition.
further cross examination by Mr Dwyer in relation to the mother’s evidence
concerning the children’s schools from 2014
onwards, and when the mother
was asked whether she would rely upon the children’s choice of school or
whether she would decide,
the mother said it would be the children’s
choice and said further that she could always override that if she thought the
was wrong. The mother said there would be a discussion and depending
upon available funds and vacancies then a choice would be made.
response to a question from me, as to choice of school, the mother said she
thought it was appropriate at their present ages they
should have some

I make the following findings:
(2) The primary
considerations are:

of having a meaningful relationship with both of the
find on the evidence before me that there is a very significant benefit for both
children to be able to continue to enjoy the meaningful
relationships, which I
find on the evidence, both have with their respective parents.
find on the evidence before me that it is not surprising that [X] is expressing
increasing resistance to being bound by orders to
spend time with her father but
the evidence establishes clearly that she does not wish to reject a relationship
with her father and
I find consequently that she wants to maintain a
relationship with him but in a different form. It is that which I find will be
continuing benefit for her.

from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to,
abuse, neglect or
I am satisfied on the evidence before me that neither parent will willingly
expose either child to risks of this nature, the
evidence establishes that both
parents have engaged in conversation with the children about the other parent
and in a critical manner
on some occasions.
I am satisfied that both parents have tried very hard to avoid exposing the
children to such statements and conflict, such is
the nature of their reciprocal
antipathy that it is likely that neither has been able to succeed.
evidence does not establish that as a consequence of such acts on behalf of the
parents, the children have suffered psychological
harm although [X] has attended
counselling but this came to an end some time ago.
parents need to be vigilant and alert to not exposing the children to critical
discussion of the other parent.
(3) Additional considerations

maturity or level of understanding) that the
thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the

children must be given considerable weight.
rationale behind those views was not the subject of any evidence either in cross
examination or otherwise which would cause me
to depart from such conclusion.
Further, Ms D’s opinions as expressed in the Family Report were not the
subject of any testing
or cross examination which warranted her to change her
views, save that Ms D considered it would be appropriate for [X] to spend
fixed or certain periods of time with her father to avoid the risk of not
spending any time at all if she found her other interests
more attractive as she
grows into young adulthood and individuates from both her parents.
am satisfied on the evidence that both children are sufficiently mature and gave
very careful consideration to the expression of
their preferred wishes. In
particular, I give significant weight to [Y]’s wish to spend more time
with his father.
b) the nature of the relationship of the

loving relationship with each of their parents
although equally, I find that the
nature of such relationship with each parent is different with the mother being
more accommodating
and understanding of the children’s changing needs as
they grow and the father being a little more rigid. In particular, I
find on the
evidence that the father has some limitation in his capacity and insight to
accept the need for flexibility in relation
to the time [X] spends with him. The
father’s preference for a rigid regime with [X] does not recognise her
changing needs
as she becomes a young adult.

seems to me, and I find on the evidence that it would not be appropriate for
[X], in effect, to be able to choose when she spends
time with her father.
Consequently, I propose to order, based partly on the evidence of Ms D and
partly on what I find to be in [X]’s
best interests that she will spend
prescribed and certain periods of time with her father with flexibility as to
other times.
to [Y], it seems to me that he should have the opportunity to spend longer
periods of time with his father. In so concluding, I
take into account the
father’s strongly expressed wish that both children return to the mother
on the Sunday evening at 5.00pm
during school terms but for the reasons to which
I have referred earlier, it seems to me important for [Y] and in his best
to have this opportunity to spend additional time with his father.

as well as their respective emotional and intellectual needs.
there is some criticism of the father’s accommodation, I am not satisfied
on the evidence before me that the children
are disadvantaged in such
accommodation or that it is to their detriment. As to the father’s
evidence concerning his intention
to perhaps change his residential premises, it
seems to me that if my decision is that the current arrangements pursuant to the
orders remain in place, or something similar to that he is likely to
remain where he is but on the other hand, if the father’s
application is
successful he will find improved accommodation.
am equally satisfied that if the home the mother occupies is to be sold she will
do her best to find appropriate accommodation for
herself and the children

(4) Without limiting paragraphs (3)(c) and (i), the

particular, the extent to which each of the child's parents:
(a) has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:
(i) to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in
relation to the child; and
(ii) to spend time with the child; and
(iii) to communicate with the child; and
facilitated, or failed to facilitate, the other parent:

in the best interests of the child for the child’s

father proposes equal shared parental responsibility for both children.
mother proposes equal shared parental responsibility for all matters but
excluding decisions concerning the children’s education
which she asks be
preserved to her.
the orders I propose to make I will define those matters about which the parents
are required to consult with a view to reaching
an agreement.
proposing to make such orders, I find that the poor relationship and poor
communication between the parents is not such that they
are disabled from
talking to each other about the major long term issues concerning the
children’s care, welfare and development.
both parents maintain a degree of lack of trust of the other parent and each
criticises the other for not notifying some significant
matters including health
and education, it seems to me, and I find on the evidence that for there not to
be an order for equal shared
parental responsibility is not in the
children’s best interests.
coming to the conclusion that the presumption of equal shared parental
responsibility is not rebutted, I take into account those
matters about which
the parents are required to confer and consult with each other and make a
genuine effort to come to a joint decision
are likely to revolve around
education. Whilst at the commencement of the hearing one might have been left
with the impression that
education and choice of school was an intractable issue
with the high probability of dead lock and some possibility of leading to
further proceedings, the evidence at the conclusion of the hearing is quite
evidence establishes that there is no real issue about choice of school for the
children with both parents supportive of the proposition
that both children
continue to receive the best education that is available for them. The issue in
relation to education flowed from
cost with the father’s assertion that
the parents could not afford a private education.
father’s evidence at the end of the case, quite clearly, is that he does
not object to the schools for each child for the
remainder of 2013 or beyond,
and the mother has agreed to pay the fees. It seems to me that in the best
interests of the children,
the right should be reserved to both parents to share
jointly the responsibility of choosing a school, whether it be private or
The decision of a public school may arise, when, for example, if the
mother’s legacy from her late mother’s estate is
not sufficient to
fund the remainder of the children’s education. In my view, it is
appropriate therefore for both parents
to consult each other and make a genuine
effort to come to a joint decision about an appropriate public school if such
need arises.
seems to me that the poor level of communication does not mean that one parent
ought to be excluded from the decision making process
in relation to the
children’s education. It would be different if one parent was
disinterested in the child’s education
or had not taken any active part in
the upbringing of the child or had not shown a commitment to spending time with
and caring for
this case, clearly on the evidence before me, the father is an interested and
devoted parent and I find on the whole of the evidence
that the children’s
attachment to him, as well as their mother, requires input from both parents as
to choice of school, if
the need arises.
coming to this conclusion, I find on the evidence that this is not a case where
the parents inability to communicate relates to
all aspects of the upbringing of
their children and has not resulted in chronic intractable conflict from which
the children have
suffered as to any decision made by their parents.
coming to this decision, I have taken into account the written submissions made
by the father and the oral submissions made by
Mr Weightman on behalf of the
father submitted that the issue of schooling after 2013 is a difficult matter
and seems to require an adjudicator. Mr Weightman
submitted that it was
necessary for one parent to have sole parental responsibility for selection of
the high school and that it
was appropriate for the mother to bear that
responsibility but with appropriate notice to be given to the father, for
kept informed, and on the premise not that there would be the
possibility of a
Rice and Asplund argument if there had been no change of circumstances but that
he be kept informed of the mother’s
selection in those circumstances
prevailing.
reasons I have given, when I come to weigh the whole of the evidence and whilst
at first sight it may be an attractive proposition
for the mother to have sole
parental responsibility for the selection of a high school, and whilst there is
no suggestion the mother
would act capriciously, I conclude it is preferable for
both parents to share the responsibility of selection of high school,
particularly
for [Y], if it becomes necessary.
seems to me, on the balance of probabilities, that there will be a remote chance
of disagreement. I give that factor considerable
weight given that on the whole
of the evidence, both parents would like the children to receive the best
education possible and the
father is not in dispute with the mother as to [X]
attending [F] School for years 11 and 12. The mother’s evidence is to the
effect, and I accept such evidence, that she has now told [Y] that he will not
be returning to [P] School but is more likely to attend
[S] School.
reasons to which I have referred earlier in this judgment, the father is not
opposed to the children attending these schools.
is the father’s case that if the mother is unable to afford private school
fees then the most likely appropriate schools
are [M] School, a State selective
High School, [H] School or [L] School. I have some degree of confidence that if
the children are
to attend State Schools both parents will be able to discuss
which school is best equipped to meet the individual child’s needs
therefore more likely to agree rather than disagree. If there is a disagreement
than I will put in place orders to consult
with a Family Dispute Resolution
Practitioner.

find on the whole of the evidence before me that this is not a case where it is
in the best interests of either child to spend equal
time with each of the
parents or indeed, as the father seeks from after school on Monday until 5.00pm
reasoning is that for reasons I have given earlier, the evidence establishes
that both children are of an age and level of maturity
to express a wish to
which the Court can give weight and in the circumstances of this case ought give
the evidence of Ms D and her evaluation and recommendations were not displaced
during the course of the hearing, save that
I am not able to ignore the fact
that [X] is now considerably older and Ms D qualified her recommendation in
relation to [X]. Specifically,
whilst Ms D considered it appropriate for [X] to
have input into making arrangements to spend time with her father, largely in
with her wishes, it was nevertheless, as Ms D agreed, appropriate
that she spend some core time with her father at the same time
as [Y] so at to
avoid the risk of her relationship with her father being disturbed.
other matter to consider in relation to equal time is that the father is now
engaged in regular employment involving shift work
and on his evidence, for the
greater part of the time, will not be available to directly care for the
children in the morning at
the time that they go to school. Whilst I am
satisfied that he is able to put in place arrangements for his mother to look
the children, that is not necessarily preferable or ideal when the mother
is available. That is not to criticise the father for his
earnest wish to share
equal time with the children nor indeed his mother but rather, to look at the
practicalities.
it is not a case where I find on the evidence that it is necessary for the
children to spend more time with their father
to enhance their relationship with
him in their best interests. Both children already have a well established and
fond and close
relationship with their father.
if I were to accede to the father’s wishes, it is likely that [X] will
become resistant and refuse to spend such time
with her father with the
attendant risk that her relationship with her father will suffer with some
consequent degree of resentment,
perhaps on the part of both of them. That risk
is not warranted and is to be avoided.
to [Y], it is his clearly stated wish to spend more time with his father, but
not as much as equal time. I give such expressed
wish considerable weight, and
find that alternate periods from after school Thursday until back to school
Tuesday and broadly half
school holidays are appropriate.
to school holiday periods, it seems to me that is it appropriate for [X] to
spend some fixed week periods of time with her father
at the same time as [Y]
but not as much as half every holiday period.
seems to me that if [X] is required to spend two weeks of the Christmas school
holiday period with her father at the same time
as [Y], which flows from matters
arising during submissions and will be in the second half of such holiday
period, and [Y] is also
required to spend such two week period that will enable
the children to perhaps enjoy a holiday with their father away from Newcastle
enjoy time together pursuing activities locally.
evidence establishes that the father has confidence in being able to secure
leave from his employment over the Christmas period.
to the other school holidays, it seems to me that [X] should be required to
spend one week of the holidays with her father at the
end of the second term but
otherwise by arrangement with him during the school holidays at the end of the
first and third terms.
coming to this conclusion, I take into account in all probability, [X] will
continue to prefer to mix with her peers, take up employment
opportunities but
also be devoting a very considerable amount of her time to studying during the
last two years of high school as
she prepares for the Higher School Certificate
and perhaps tertiary education.
Final Conclusion
determined equal shared parental responsibility and the time to be spent with
each parent for the reasons given above, there
are some ancillary matters to be
considered for determination, some of which resolved during the course of
submissions.
to Christmas, both parents agreed ultimately that the children spend time with
their mother on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day
and both spend time with their
father from 10.00am Boxing Day, 26 December until 3.00pm on 28 December.
propose to make orders that both children spend time together with their father
for two weeks during the remainder of the Christmas
school holidays as is agreed
between the parents, but in the absence of agreement I will define the period
broadly to conclude on
the Saturday morning of the last weekend of the school
to Easter, the mother proposed that [Y] spend time with the father, until the
age of 16 years, from 8.00am on Good Friday until
8.00am on Easter Saturday in
odd numbered years and from 8.00am on Easter Saturday until 3.00pm on Easter
Sunday in even numbered
father proposed that until each child attains the age of 16 years the children
spend time with him from 9.00am on Good Friday
until 9.00am on Easter Saturday
each year thereafter with the mother for the balance of the Easter period.
that this issue is not the subject of any challenge by either parent or detailed
evidence or submissions, and given that Easter
falls within the school holiday
period on more occasions than it falls outside school holidays, I do not propose
to make any specific
order for Easter. On the evidence before me, there is
nothing to suggest that it is a religious occasion of significance for either
parent or either child to warrant specific orders. Consequently, I decline to
make any orders in respect of Easter.
father sought an order in his outline of case document that he would like the
children to accompany him to their Aunt’s
wedding on the North Coast over
the period Thursday 16
May to Wednesday
was not the subject of any specific evidence or cross examination as to why such
a period was required. I propose therefore to
accommodate the father’s
application and for this to be a weekend over which both children are to spend
time with their father
from after school on the Thursday, 16 May until the
commencement of school on Monday 20 May. This event does not take place during
school holidays and there is no reason advanced by the father to justify five
days absence from school for either of the children.
is no issue in relation to the children being with the mother on the
Mother’s Day weekend and the father on the Father’s
Day weekend and
I will order accordingly.
to the children’s birthdays, there are competing proposals with the father
suggesting a period of five hours close to or
during the week of each
child’s birthday that [dates omitted] depending upon his work commitments
and at a time agreed between
the parents with the father to give a weeks prior
notice to the mother as to his availability to facilitate the time. The father
suggests that if the children are with him on their birthdays that they spend
time with their mother from 12.00 noon until 5.00pm
on both days if it is a non
school day or from after school until 8.00pm if the birthday is a school day. In
each case, the father
is suggesting a period of five hours.
mother’s proposal is a little different, essentially for the children to
spend time with the other parent for three hours
on a non school day from 12.00
noon until 3.00pm or on a school day from 3.00pm until 6.00pm.
the competing proposals, it seems to me and I find that the father’s
proposal has a greater element of flexibility
but more importantly provides a
longer period of time to enjoy a birthday celebration or an outing together.
to medical expenses, there was a consensus during submissions that each parent
bear the costs of minor medical expenses for each
child less than $50.00
including visits to a doctor, prescriptions, prescribed, over the counter
medication and the like.
agreement in relation to medical expenses over the amount of $50.00 is that such
will be shared equally and with medical expenses
to be defined to include dental
and optometrist. I propose to make an order to define medical expenses to
include those incurred
for treatment by any doctor (general practitioner),
specialist treating doctor, physician, surgeon, radiologist, psychologist,
psychiatrist,
dentist, dental surgeon, optician, optometrist and
physiotherapist. I will define also the means of notifying the expense and the
logistics of sharing the payment.
father proposes that the parents agree in writing to all overseas travel with
and for the children. In general terms, the mother
does not oppose such an order
but does oppose a restriction of time for travel as suggested by the father for
a period of four weeks.
propose to make a general order for each parent to give the other prior notice
of any proposal to take either or both children overseas
and for appropriate
make up time.
these reasons, I make the following orders.
would like to think that the conclusion of these proceedings will give both
parents a better understanding of the matters the Court
is required to consider
when parents are not able to agree and which I hope will in turn enable the
parents to have a better understanding
of the importance of them co-operating
with each other about any individual issues which may arise, considering the
various alternatives,
discussing those alternatives with both being prepared to
compromise, when necessary, to reach an agreement.
my view, agreement between the parents as to any other matters will be a very
significant gift for both parents to give their children.
It is pertinent to
remember that as the children told Ms R in October 2011 both were well aware of
the acrimonious nature of the
parental dispute and at times have been drawn into
the conflict by way of being made (messenger). Whilst there is some suggestion
on the evidence that the parents have tried harder to protect the children from
their dispute they have a little way to go to be
successful.
have some confidence that with each being willing to do so, they will begin to
better appreciate what their children need in the
latter years of their
