LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES:
Regina: R. Shafiq, Director of Public Prosecutions
Offender: B.
Adamovich, Legal Aid Comission (NSW)
1. On 28 March 2000 the offender was sentenced top
serve two community services orders. These sentences were imposed by the Penrith
Local Court. One order was for a duration of 150 hours and the other for 100
hours. The orders were to be performed concurrently.
2. The offender
performed only 18 of the total of 150 hours of the orders.
application dated 20 October 2000, and listed at the Blacktown Local Court on 16
November 2000, pursuant to
Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act
, the Probation and Parole Service made application for revocation of the
community services orders on the basis of the offender’s
failure to comply
with his obligations under the orders. On 16 November 2000 there was no
appearance of the offender and the Local
Court issued warrants. The matter was
relisted on 5 March 2001. On 10 May 2001 the offender appeared and admitted that
he had failed
to complete the hours required under the orders. There is no
record that the Local Court actually revoked the community services
orders. The
matter was adjourned to the Drug Court for sentence.
4. On 30 August 2001
the Drug Court sentenced the offender in relation to other matters, and released
him onto a Drug Court program.
The longest initial sentence imposed on 30 August
was a sentence of eleven months imprisonment. The applications for revocation of
the community service orders were adjourned to a later date.
offender argues that, as the community service orders were not revoked prior to
the expiry of the orders on 28 March 2001,
they cannot now be revoked. The Court
could only act if, pursuant to
Crimes (Administration of Sentences)
, an application was made for an extension of the orders.
April 2000 the
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999
commenced operation.
Pursuant to
and Div 3, Sch 2 of the Act, the orders imposed on 28 March
2000 are taken to be community service orders within the meaning of the
(Sentencing Procedure) Act
7. Pursuant to
(Administration of Sentences) Act
the “relevant maximum period” in
relation to each of the orders was twelve months.
Section 110
Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act
provides that:
Unless sooner revoked, a community service order remains in force:
(a) until the offender has performed community
service work in accordance with the offender's obligations under the order for
required number of hours, or
(b) until the expiry of the relevant
maximum period, or (c) in the case of a community service order under
Fines Act 1996
, until the order is revoked or satisfied in accordance
with that Act,
whichever first occurs. Subdivision 2 Administration of
community service orders
Section 115
Crimes (Administration of
Sentences) Act
deals with the revocation of community services orders.
enables an application for revocation of a community service order to be
made to the sentencing court or a court of like jurisdiction
or a court superior
to the sentencing court.
Section 115(6)(a)
provides that failure by an offender
to perform the required number of hours of community service work under the
order within the
relevant maximum period is taken to constitute a failure to
comply with obligations under the order.
Section 115(2)(a)
commenced on 15
February 2001 and provides that an application for revocation of a community
service order cannot be made later than
one month after the expiry of the
relevant maximum period for the order.
10. Prior to 15 February 2001,
there was no limitation on the period within which an application for revocation
could be made. The
second reading speech for the
Crimes (Administration of
Sentences) Amendment Bill 2000
“The Bill amends s115 to state that an application for revocation of a
community service order cannot be made later than one
month after the expiry of
the time in which the order is to be served. This amendment reinstates a long
existing rule relating to
community service orders. The rule had been deleted by
the new Act on the basis that it would give the Probation and Parole Service
greater flexibility in dealing with breaches of community service orders.
Deletion of the rule has, however, caused some
confusion.”
11. The second reading speech
confirms that the insertion of ss(2)(a) limited the Probation and Parole
officer’s “flexibility”
in dealing with breaches of community
service orders, i.e. absent ss(2)(a) the Service could have made application to
revoke a community
service order at any time after the expiry of the
12. I accept the prosecution’s contention that, despite the
expiry of a relevant maximum period and the order ceasing to be
force”, a community service order remains an order of the court. Just
because it is no longer “in force”
does not mean that it has ceased
to exist. If, upon expiry of a relevant maximum period, the associated order
ceased to exist, then
there would be no utility in applying for revocation
during the one month (formerly unlimited) period following expiry (as is
contemplated
by s115(2)(a)), nor would s114(2) (which enables an application for
extension of a community service order to be made after the expiry
of the order)
serve any purpose. The prosecution’s contention was accepted by His Honour
Judge Milson in R v
[2001] NSWDRGC 4.
I agree with that decision. I
decline to follow the decisions of Regina v Takau (unreported, Tupman DCJ,
District Court of New South
Wales, 28 May 2001) and Regina v Leite (unreported,
Blanch CJ, District Court of New South Wales, 9 March 2001).
13. I revoke
the community service orders.
