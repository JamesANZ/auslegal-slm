Abstract/Description:
This contribution raises the question of the place the New Silk Roads strategy could have for Africa and its 54 economies. It also
asks what China’s focus on Africa teaches us about Chinese expectations for global governance. To answer these questions, the
chapter first assesses Africa’s relative economic importance to China (first investment, second trade) and shows that this
importance is more obvious from a geopolitical than strictly economic point of view, before suggesting that Africa is serving as
a springboard for China in its definition of a new global governance.
