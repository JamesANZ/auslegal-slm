Reasons for Decision
1 This is the second application for rehearing from the same party
in relation to a decision made by Member Mallam on 2 February 2001.
application was rejected by Member Deamer by reasons given on 12 April 2001.
The present application was received on
18 May 2001.
2 The building contract giving rise to the dispute was entered
into on 15 May 2000. The respondent agreed to supply and fit gutters
surface the roof of the applicants’ home. The price was $7500, with
variations later giving rise to a price increase to
$8000. After entering into
the contract, the applicants paid $1250 made up of 10 per cent deposit ($750)
and $500 in cash for the
agreed variations. By early June 2000 disputes had
arisen. The applicants’ last contact with the builders was on or about
July 2000. Their application to the Tribunal was lodged on 18 July 2000. It
sought return of money paid on basis of defective
3 At hearing on 30 October 2000 the respondent indicated that it
wished to continue with the job, and sought payment under the contract.
works were incomplete. The contract was unenforceable due to non compliance
with the Home
Building Act
in that it did not include the statutory warranties.
Consequently, the Member proceeded to assess any entitlement of the respondent
on a ‘work and labour done’ basis.
4 The applicants produced an expert report without the author
being present. The respondent had an expert witness present who gave
and was questioned. The Member favoured the evidence from the
respondent’s expert. He was not satisfied that the
works were so
defective as to justify termination of the contract. He issued two
‘interim orders’. The first was that
the respondent complete all
work including the agreed variations. Under the second order, the applicants
were required to pay $5950
‘immediately that the work identified in the
first order has been carried out in a tradesmanlike manner’. The result
was that the respondent could look forward to a total payment of $7200, on
completion of the job.
5 Leave was given to either party to renew the application until
31 December 2000 when the interim orders were declared to become
6 The respondent wrote to the Tribunal on 6 November 2000
expressing concern over the nature of the order, which it considered was
accordance with what had been said on the day at the hearing and which it saw as
impractical, in that the work might be done
and payment still withheld. Another
letter was written on 29 November 2000 where the respondent advised that the
owner had refused
to allow their workers back on site. Separately the
applicants wrote to the Tribunal asking that the matter be relisted as the
had not complied with the interim orders.
7 On 2 February 2001 the Tribunal issued a substitute order with
short reasons for decision requiring the applicants to pay the respondent
for the value of work done. Consequently the applicants have in effect been
required to pay $5700 for the value of the incomplete
works, as compared to the
original price of $8000.
8 The applicants applied for a rehearing by application dated 12
February 2001. The application was within the time provided for
by cl 19 of the
Fair Trading Tribunal Regulation 1999. The application was considered under s
63 of the Fair Trading Tribunal Act
1998 by Member Deamer as delegate of the
Chairperson. It was dismissed by decision dated 12 April 2001.
9 The reasons referred to the written submissions of the
applicants as to the ‘substantial injustice’ that they claimed
had suffered by reason of the original decision. There were submissions going
to each of the three specific categories in s
63(1) - (a) (not fair and
equitable), (b) (against the weight of the evidence) and (c) (evidence not
reasonably available before).
10 The new application covers the same ground with some additional
submissions.
of Power to consider Second Rehearing Application
11 The practice of the Tribunal has varied on this matter. Until
early 2000 it was the practice to consider further rehearing applications
the first one had been dismissed. The practice ceased. In December 2000 the
Crown Solicitor’s office advised that the
relevant section, s 63, did not
limit the number of rehearing applications that could be filed, though it
considered that the likelihood
of an applicant obtaining a different outcome, as
compared to the first application, was highly unlikely. Similar views were
by the Acting Chairperson in a decision in January 2001, and so the
Tribunal has since followed the practice of entertaining further
applications from the same party after the first has been
12 I have doubts about there being any power in the Chairperson to
receive a further rehearing application from the same party. The
principle of
finality of litigation stands in the way of such a proposition. On the other
hand s 63 is less than clear on the subject.
I will not seek to resolve that
question on this occasion. Instead I will examine the application with a view
to considering whether
it should be received out of time.
Importance of Time
Requirements in respect of Making of Applications
13 Plainly the time lines set by cl 19 of the Fair Trading
Tribunal Regulation 1999 in respect of the making of rehearing applications
days after notice of decision from the Registrar; or 14 days after receipt of a
written statement of reasons where that has been
requested) can not be satisfied
in the case of a further rehearing application from the same party. That means
compliance with the
time requirement would need to be dispensed with under cl
14 There will rarely be justification for receiving a further
application out of time from the same party who has already been refused
rehearing. A fundamental goal of the Tribunal’s legislation is to provide
a system for speedy resolution of disputes. A
generous or flexible approach to
dispensing with the time requirements defeats that purpose.
Assessment of Latest
Application
15 In my opinion, the application does no more than reiterate the
submissions made by the applicants in respect of their first unsuccessful
application. The matters now raised were canvassed in Member Deamer’s
decision refusing the first application. Some additional
evidence is sought to
be raised, relating to the weather on 29 and 30 November 2000. The applicants
have had ample opportunity in
the past to bring forward this
information.
16 There is no basis for receiving the application out of time, so
as to reopen the decision of Member Deamer as delegate in respect
of the first
application; or to reopen the original decision of Member
17 The application is dismissed.

I HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THIS IS A TRUE AND ACCURATE RECORD OF THE REASONS
