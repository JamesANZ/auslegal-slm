applicants seek special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of the Australian Capital Territory (Mossop, Baker
and McWilliam JJ) which
dismissed the applicants' appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the
Australian Capital Territory
(Curtin A-J), and from a judgment of the Court
of Appeal of the Australian Capital Territory (Mossop A-CJ) which dismissed the
applicants'
appeal to set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal. An extension
of time is required in application C14/2024.
light of the concession by the applicants that the effect of the amendment to
Court Procedures Rules 2006
(ACT) is that a grant of special
leave to appeal on the ground concerning a denial of procedural fairness is no
longer appropriate,
the applications raise no issue of general public importance
and have insufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant of special
to appeal. Accordingly, it would be futile to grant an extension of time in
application C14/2024.
leave to appeal is refused with costs with the applicants to pay the costs of
the first and second respondents.
