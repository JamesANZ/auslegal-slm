INTRODUCTION
[1] The plaintiff has commenced proceedings claiming monies
owed under a contract for the provision of carpentry services to the defendant.
[2] The claim is defended on the basis that the defendant alleges that the
plaintiff is in breach of the agreement as the services
and works provided did
not meet the agreed standard and were defective.
THE PLAINTIFF’S
[3] The plaintiff has applied for the following orders:
1) Pursuant to r 171 of the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
(Qld) (UCPR),
paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the defence to be struck out.
2) The defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of and incidental to this
application on an indemnity basis.
[4] The application is opposed by the

STRIKE OUT APPLICATION
plaintiff applies to effectively strike out the entirety of the defence.
[9] The only paragraph in the defence not subject to challenge on the strike
out application is paragraph 1, where the defendant admits
the plaintiff was a
company incorporated according to law and capable of suing.
application is brought pursuant to r 171 of the UCPR.
1) This rule applies if a pleading or part of a pleading –
no reasonable cause of action or defence; or
tendency to prejudice or delay a fair trial of the proceeding; or
unnecessary or scandalous; or
frivolous or vexatious; or
otherwise an abuse of the process of the court
court, at any stage of the proceeding, may strike out all or part of the
pleading and order the costs of the application to be
paid by a party calculated
on the indemnity basis
[12] The plaintiff contends that the defence is susceptible to strike out upon
the basis that it
- Alleges the terms of the agreement were different to
those pleaded but does not say with precision what those agreed terms were.
- Alleges the plaintiff was in breach of some terms of the agreement but
does not allege and particularise what that term is or how
it has been breached.
- Attempts to raise a set-off but that is not pleaded or particularised.
- The particulars of the defence are vague and are liable to cause the
plaintiff surprise at trial.
[13] The defendant responds that the defence
and subsequent further and better particulars adequately plead the
defendant’s
case and ought not be struck out.
STRIKE OUT APPLICATION
– THE RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES
[14] In Royalene Pty Ltd v The
Registrar of Titles and Mistilis
[2007] QSC 059
the court said in respect of r
171 at paragraph 6
The focus of argument was principally on UCPR 171(1)(a)
which is concerned with pleadings that disclose no reasonable cause of action
defence. UCPR 171(3) provides that on the hearing of an application to strike
out part of a pleading, the court is not limited
to receiving evidence about the
pleading. Even to the extent that that may involve a relaxation of the approach
that applied under
the former rules, there is still good reason to regard the
applicable principle to be that the discretion to strike out should only
exercised where the defence raised is obviously untenable. Conversely it should
not be exercised except in clear cases. (General
Steel Industries Inc v
Commissioner for Railways (NSW)
[1964] HCA 69
[1964] 112 CLR 125
, 130; Dey v Victorian
Railways Commissioners
[1949] 78 CLR 62
, 84 and 91). That is especially so where
the case is pleaded as a circumstantial one and the inference to be drawn from
critical to determining liability is not common ground and the evidence
is untested.
[15] Similarly, the Court of Appeal decision of Robert Bax and
Associates v Cavenham Pty Ltd [2011] QCA53 when the Court said in respect
rule at paragraph 16
closely resembles the language of former O 22 r
32 Rules of the Supreme Court 1991 (Qld) which enabled a judge to strike out or
any matter in the pleading which tended ‘to prejudice, embarrass, or
delay, the fair trial of the action.’ The word ‘embarrass’
not been retained. Nonetheless any pleading which is difficult to follow or
objectively ambiguous or creates difficulty for the
opposite party insofar as
the pleading contains inconsistencies, is liable to strike out because it can be
said to have a tendency
to prejudice or delay the fair trial of the proceeding
rather than ‘embarrass’ the opposite party.
considerations of r 171 follow the principles enunciated in the decision in
Butler v Crowley and Galvin Solicitors
[1999] QSC 6
where the Honourable Justice
Muir said commencing at paragraph 4
In my view, it would be unjust to permit
a trial of action on the basis of the allegations in the statement of claim. The
could not hope to identify with any reasonable precision the case it
is called on the meet. It would also be put in the position
of having to prepare
to meet innumerable allegations which are irrelevant to allegations of breach of
duty and loss of damage...
the duration of any trial of the action and, in
consequence, its cost, would be unnecessarily increased and the prospects of due
determination of relevant issues decreased. The defendant would be prejudiced by
being unable to sensibly formulate an offer of settlement...
THE PLEADINGS
[17] The plaintiff identifies two bases upon which it attacks the
defendant’s pleadings, namely
- It argues that all paragraphs in the
defence do not disclose a reasonable defence to the action because they fail to
plead all necessary
material facts.
- Those paragraphs in the pleadings are
similarly vague.
OBLIGATION TO PLEAD MATERIAL FACTS
[18] In considering
the defendant’s pleading, the requirements of a defence provided by r
149(1) UCPR must be considered.
[19] Rule 149(1) UCPR requires that each
pleading must
as brief as the nature of the case permits; and
a statement of all the material facts on which the party relies but not the
evidence by which the facts are to be proved;
specifically any matter that if not stated specifically may take another party
by surprise; and
to r 156, state specifically any relief the party claims; and
defence under an Act is relied on – identify the specific provision under
[20] ‘Material facts’ in the context of r 149 have been described as
‘... necessary for the purpose of formulating
a complete cause of
[21] The correct approach to
pleading material facts was summarised by Jackson J in Mio Art Pty Ltd v
Macequest Pty Ltd
[2013] QSC 211
where His Honour said
If a plaintiff proves
all the material facts, it must succeed on the cause of action. Thus the case is
reduced to its factual skeleton
in law. By adhering to the concept of a material
fact in the practice of pleadings, the courts serve the purposes of efficiency
cost-saving which inform the procedural rules. The only issues joined are
upon material facts. The only evidence led proves or disproves
the material
facts. The decision in the case is not affected by the irrelevant and the
decision maker is not distracted from the
material facts.
by those considerations, the search in paragraphs [1] to [24] for the precise
material facts that constitute the specific
breaches of the covenant or contract
is objectionable pleading. In my view, even if it does not offend the
requirements that the
pleading “must... be as brief as the nature of the
case permits [and] not [contain] the evidence by which the facts are to
proved.” For brevity, I will call such a problem the ‘narrative
The narrative defect obscures the articulation of exactly
what constitutes the relevant breaches of covenant or contract.
approach was endorsed by Freeburn J in the decision of Earthtec Pty Ltd v
Livingstone Shire Council
[2023] QSC 22
where His Honour observed
statement of claim serves to identify the material facts that support the claims
made in the claim...
The requirements of brevity, and the requirement to
state the material facts rather than the evidence, serve as an important
The objective is for the case to be reduced to its ‘factual
skeleton.’ Thus, if a statement of claim pleads material
that does not
comprise material facts, the defendant is required to respond with the result
that unnecessary fronts are opened in
the battle between litigants.
Honour continued
The requirement in UCPR 149(1)(c), that a party identify
any matter that may take their opponent by surprise, may sometimes justify
pleadings that go beyond the material facts that are strictly necessary for the
claim or the ground of defence. In that sense the
‘no surprise’
requirement in UCPR 149(1)(c) operates as an exception to the requirement in
UCPR 149(1)(b) that the pleading
contain a statement of all the material facts
on which the party relies but not the evidence by which the facts are to be
The ‘no surprise’ exception does not require a
pleader to guarantee that the opposing party will encounter nothing unexpected
at the trial. Trials are full of the unexpected. The ‘no surprise’
exception requires that a pleading contain all that
is reasonably and fairly
necessary to ensure that the opposing party is not met at the trial by an
unexpected turn in the case which
that party, acting in good faith and
reasonably, is unable to meet because of a natural failure to prepare to meet it
having regard
to the content of the pleading. Whether a pleading does or does
not comply with this requirement is a matter for the assessment and
judgment of
the judge who must decide the question ahead of the trial, like all pre-trial
The ‘no surprise’ exception does not give a pleader an
open licence to plead immaterial facts or to plead evidence. The
intention is
merely to provide for exceptional cases where there is a genuine apprehension of
surprise. To give the ‘no surprise’
exception a wider function would
undermine the requirement of UCPR 149(1)(b) to plead all the material facts on
which the party relies
but not the evidence by which the facts are to be proved.
The effect of UCPR 149(1)(b) is to confine the pleading to material facts
and to exclude matters of evidence from the pleading. Where
there is no
reasonable prospect of surprise only the material facts ought to be pleaded.
That is because pleadings which trespass
into evidence endanger proper
definition of the issues and risks the creation of false issues. As it happens,
in modern civil litigation
the element of surprise is largely diminished by the
common practice of having the parties, usually in advance of the trial, file
serve affidavits or statements or even summaries of their
evidence-in-chief.
[24] In considering the plaintiff’s contentions it
is necessary to keep the distinction between material facts and particulars
firmly in mind.
[25] Rule 157 obliges a party to include in a pleading
particulars necessary to
the issues for, and prevent surprise at, the trial; and
the opposite party to plead; and
a matter specifically pleaded under rule 150.
[26] Rule 160 provides the way to give particulars.
[27] Rule 160 provides
1) If rules 157 to 159 require particulars to be given, the particulars must
be stated in the pleading or, if that is inconvenient,
in a separate document
mentioned in, and filed and served with, the pleading.
particulars may be given by correspondence.
3) A party giving further
particulars must file a copy of the particulars.
[28] The defendant has
given further particulars of the defence, effectively in correspondence by
filing and serving further and better
particulars on 7 May 2024.
the defence and further and better particulars (forming part of it) which is the
pleading subject to challenge and required
to be considered.
[30] In Bruce v
Odhams Press Ltd
Scott LJ observed
of particulars is intended to meet and further and quite separate requirement of
pleading, imposed in fairness and justice
to the defendant. Their function is to
fill in the picture of the plaintiff’s cause of action with information
sufficiently
detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to
meet and to enable him to prepare for trial.
[31] The High Court endorsed
those principles in Banque Commerciale SA En Liquidation v Akhil Holdings
where the court said
The function of
pleadings is to state with sufficient clarity the case that must be met... in
this way, pleadings serve to ensure
the basic requirement of procedural fairness
that a party should have an opportunity of meeting the case against him or her
incidentally, to define the issues for decision.
[32] In the context of
an application to strike out paragraphs in a statement of claim, White J in
Thiess Pty Ltd v FFE Minerals Australia
articulated the purpose of pleadings in
these terms
More generally the purpose of pleadings is to inform the
opposite party of the case it has to meet and permit, in a responsive pleading,
the issues to be narrowed.
[33] In respect
to a similar challenge to a pleading as ‘vague’ Her Honour observed
that while r 171 UCPR did not employ
the terminology of the previous Supreme
Court rule, which enabled a judge to strike out or order amendment to a pleading
which tendered
to – prejudice, embarrass, or delay the fair trial of an
action that nonetheless a pleading may be still struck out if it is
‘unintelligible, ambiguous, vague, or too general, so as to embarrass the
opposite party who does not know what is alleged
CONSIDERATION
plaintiff’s pleaded claim in the statement of claim is in simple form and
effectively pleads that
parties entered into written agreements for the provision of carpentry services.
terms included that the plaintiff would provide carpentry services to the
defendant in accordance with work orders.
terms included the defendant would make payment to the plaintiff for the
carpentry services.
plaintiff issued three tax invoices to the defendant for a total of $12,733.96
being the value of the carpentry services.
[35] The defence pleads that
were agreements between the parties for provision by the plaintiff of carpentry
terms of the agreements, the particulars of which in the further and better
particulars provide with clarity, and details of
the conversations giving rise
to those terms in the agreement, included that the works would be carried out by
the plaintiff with
due care and skill and to a specific standard and in a
specific timeframe and to completion.
further and better particulars also plead with precision that the carpentry
services provided by the plaintiff including the framing
were defective in that
they were not constructed in accordance with BCA Australian National Code, were
not in accordance with architectural
and engineering plans for the works, and
were not acceptable and certified by the private certifiers.
[36] The defence (including the further and better particulars) in compliance
with r 149 contain statements of the material facts
upon which the defendant
[37] The plaintiff’s complaints that the defence does not
plead the relevant material facts and is too vague are plainly not
[38] The plaintiff’s complaint that the defence attempts to raise a
set-off are without merit. The defence does not plead a
set-off, the
defendant’s counsel in supplementary oral submissions confirmed that the
defendant did not and was not intending
to plead a set-off.
plaintiff’s application to strike out the identified paragraphs of the
defence must fail.
SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES
[40] The defendant also sought
to raise the ‘simplified procedures’ pursuant to ch 13 pt 9 UCPR.
[41] Chapter 13 pt 9 provides that simplified procedures apply to a minor
A minor claim is defined as a claim for
an amount of not more than $25,000.
[42] The simplified procedures provide that, amongst other things –
court is not bound by laws of evidence or procedure applying to a proceeding in
2) May inform itself of the facts it considers appropriate
3) Must observe
the rules of natural justice
4) Must record the reasons for its
[43] The defendant therefore
contends that the pleadings requirements contained in ch 6 pt 2 – 3 do not
apply to this claim.
[44] The defendant could not cite any authority for
that proposition.
[45] The plaintiff’s application for strike-out
,having been determined to fail on first principles, further consideration of
the application of the simplified procedures to the pleadings requirements of
the UCPR is unnecessary.
DISPOSITION
[46] The plaintiff has failed to
satisfy the court that the defence (and further and better particulars) disclose
no reasonable defence,
fail to plead material facts, or are vague and the
application ought be dismissed.
[47] I order that
plaintiff’s application be dismissed.
2) That in the event parties
cannot agree costs, they are to file and serve written submissions (to be no
more than 3 typed A4 pages)
