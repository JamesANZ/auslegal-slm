The disagreement
active objectors seek leave to tender three new documents.
“evidence phase” of the hearing concluded on 5 September.
[3] The matter
is listed for four days of oral submissions in December.
[4] Whitehaven
opposes two of the three new documents going in.
statutory party has the same position as Whitehaven.
of the hearing
[6] Evidence
was heard between 21 July and 5 September 2025.
[7] At the end
of the evidence, the parties asked for the opportunity to make both written and
oral closing submissions.
September 2025, orders were made setting a regime for exchange of written
submissions:
(a) Whitehaven went first and filed written submissions on 19 September 2025;
(b) the active objectors are due to file their written submissions on 24 October
(c) the statutory party must file its written submissions on 14 November
(d) then the parties have the chance to file reply submissions.
[9] The matter
is listed for oral submissions on 3, 4, 5 and 9 December 2025.
The new documents
[10] The three
documents sought to be introduced are:
(a) Australian Climate Service, National Climate Risk Assessment 2025;
(b) Climate Change Authority, 2035 Targets Advice;
(c) Commonwealth of Australia, Net Zero Plan.
documents were publicly released on 15 and 18 September 2025.
[12] There is no
contest about the third document – the Net Zero Plan.
[13] The guiding
principle in deciding whether to grant leave to re-open is whether the interests
of justice are better served by
allowing or rejecting the
application
considerations are:
(a) the stage of the hearing that has been reached;
(b) the significance of the new evidence;
(c) the need for finality in litigation; and
(d) prejudice to the opposing parties.
[15] The High
Court has said where a hearing is complete but reasons for judgment have not yet
been delivered, the primary consideration
should be that of embarrassment or
prejudice to the other side
[16] There are
other articulations of principle that apply to re-opening a case to admit
further evidence where the hearing has concluded,
but judgment has not been
. That is not the
situation here. This hearing has not finished.
[17] Aside from
the considerations at [14] above, there is a factor that is specific to this
Court, hearing this kind of case. It
was articulated by the President of the
Court of Appeal in
Oakey Coal Action Alliance Inc v New Acland Coal Pty Ltd
. After this Court
publishes its recommendation, it is possible for the Minister responsible for
the administration of the
Mineral Resources Act
to send the matter
relevant, but which has not been considered
in the formulation of the
recommendation. For that reason, the President observed that:
unlike a proceeding in the Supreme Court, there is no inevitable finality to the
Land Court’s exercise of discretion to
refuse to admit further evidence.
A balance has to be struck between the delay occasioned by the reopening of the
case and the delay
that might be occasioned anyway if a reopening were refused
but the Minister later decided that the Land Court should consider the
information.
The position of the active objectors
[18] The active
objectors say that this case should be based on the best and most current
information available
. They say the
contentious documents would “greatly assist” the Court in its task.
[19] They point
out that the two contentious documents were only published after the evidence
phase concluded – and so there
is no question here about the active
objectors having made a decision not to lead the evidence. Or having failed to
lead the evidence
[20] Senior
Counsel for the active objectors identified aspects of the National Climate Risk
Assessment 2025 that may be relevant
to the case. The document was said to be
not inconsistent with the evidence already admitted, but a more comprehensive
the “same sort of thing”.
[21] The Climate
Change Authority’s 2035 Targets Advice is said to be akin to extrinsic
material that could help understand
the Net Zero Plan.
position of Whitehaven
[22] Opposing
the National Climate Risk Assessment 2025 and the 2035 Targets Advice,
Whitehaven says that the active objectors identify
the wrong test. Whitehaven
says that this is not about whether the new documents are “important [and]
[23] Whitehaven
relies on the evidence of its solicitor, Mr Shute, who says:
(a) there was not sufficient time for Whitehaven to address the documents before
filing its written closing submissions on 19 September
(b) it is not clear whether the active objectors intend to rely on the National
Climate Risk Assessment 2025 as part of any submissions
they may make regarding
the evidence of Professor Bambrick, Professor Bindoff, Mr Coleman and Professor
Possingham. If that is the
case, then depending on the submissions made,
Whitehaven may suffer prejudice including that it may be necessary to
cross-examine
those witnesses;
(c) it is not clear whether the active objectors intend to rely on the 2035
Targets Advice for the purpose of any submissions they
may make regarding the
evidence of Mr Gresswell or Ms Wilson. If that is the case, Whitehaven may
suffer prejudice including that
it may be necessary to recall those
(d) if the documents are admitted, Whitehaven will incur additional legal costs
and potentially costs of expert assistance given
the volume of material involved
and its technical nature.
[24] Whitehaven
disagrees that the 2035 Targets Advice is necessary to understand the Net Zero
[25] Whitehaven
is concerned that permitting the two documents might cause the need for other
documents to have to go into evidence
as well. It cites the technical reports
underpinning the National Climate Risk Assessment 2025, which may involve at
least 2,376
pages of additional documents.
[26] Whitehaven
is also concerned about the potential flow-on effect if the Court permits the
documents to go into evidence. Whitehaven
says that it would “likely ...
set a precedent for more and more documents to come in”. The statutory
party describes
this as the risk of the Court being “drip fed”
matters as they develop.
The position of the statutory
statutory party submits that:
(a) whether the new evidence (1) is so material that the interests of justice
require its admission and (2) would most probably affect
the result of the case,
are high thresholds. It says that the most relevant touchstone is, “how
would the documents probably
affect the result of the case”. It says that
that is unknown.
(b) the closing of the evidence must have significance; and
(c) this Court is not the last port of call. Additional evidence can be
considered by the ultimate decision makers.
The weighing up of the competing considerations
prejudice to Whitehaven can be avoided or ameliorated, the interests of justice
would be best served at this stage of the
hearing by the Court acting on the
most current evidence available. That is particularly so if that evidence is
going to assist
[29] There are
still four days of hearing yet to occur. That is an important factor.
prejudice, it is an unattractive proposition for the evidence phase to re-start;
with witnesses having to come back for
further cross-examination. Or witnesses
who were not previously required now having to attend to be cross-examined.
difficult to say whether that risk would be realised.
[32] It is also
difficult to say how significant the documents are to the case. The active
objectors say that they are significant.
(a) do not appear dissonant with the evidence lead by the active objectors;
(b) do not appear to present a radically new concept or idea.
Whitehaven has filed its written submissions, there is sufficient time between
now and 9 December for Whitehaven to consider
the documents and make written or
oral submissions about them.
[35] The risk
identified by Whitehaven that underlying technical reports may also have to go
into evidence, is not determinative.
The National Climate Risk Assessment 2025
appears to be capable of being read and understood on its own.
[36] Similarly,
the risk of further evidence arriving on a rolling or drip-fed basis is not
determinative. As the December hearing
dates draw closer, any fresh or updated
new evidence would be more difficult to accommodate. Any fresh or updated
evidence would
also have to be separately assessed as to how likely it would be
to prejudice the opposing parties.
[37] The main
concern is whether allowing the two contentious documents into evidence would
prompt the need for witnesses to be re-called
(or called for the first time).
The result and the orders
non-contentious document – the Net Zero Plan – will be marked as an
[39] The active
objectors are entitled to reference the Net Zero Plan in their written closing
submissions the subject of Order 4
of 5 September 2025. Whitehaven and the
Statutory Party are entitled to make submissions about the Net Zero Plan in
their reply
submissions, or orally in December.
[40] As to the
two contentious documents – the Court would be assisted by further
information before determining whether those
ought to become evidence in the
further information would most helpfully be obtained by permitting brief
additional written submissions – in parallel
with the written submissions
being produced pursuant to the Order of 5 September 2025.
[42] The brief
additional written submissions:
(a) must only address what each party would say about the two contentious
documents, if those documents were admitted into evidence;
(b) will quarantine the submissions about the contentious documents, away from
the primary submissions in the case;
(c) ought not impact or intersect with the primary written closing submissions
being prepared pursuant to the Order of 5 September
2025 (ie. the written
closing submissions should not refer to the brief additional written submissions
that are being permitted pursuant
to the Orders today).
[43] The active
objectors will have the opportunity to file submissions first, detailing what
they would submit about the National
Climate Risk Assessment 2025 and the 2035
Targets Advice, if those documents were to become evidence in the case.
[44] Whitehaven
and the statutory party will have the opportunity to reply to those separate
submissions.
[45] It may be
that after seeing what the active objectors would submit with reference to the
two contentious documents, Whitehaven
and the Statutory Party may have fewer

benefit of the separate, quarantined, submissions about the two contentious
documents, the Court will be better placed
to decide whether to admit those
documents into evidence.
