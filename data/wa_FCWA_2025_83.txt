parenting and financial proceedings commenced by [Mr Reeves] ("the
husband") and responded to by [Ms Reeves] ("the wife") are
listed for a
trial before me in [Regional Circuit A] [in] [month] 2025. The difficult
history of the proceedings to date has been
noted in judgments previously
published by Justice Cohen and is familiar to the parties in any
husband is presently self-represented. To ensure the listed trial proceeds in a
manner that is procedurally fair, and to meet
my obligations to him as a
self-represented litigant,

information, and explain various issues, well in advance
of the trial.
were made by me in chambers [in] February 2025 to that end. It was only in
those orders that the parties were advised of the
listing [in] [month] 2025
and that it would be before me. The orders expressly gave the husband
permission to participate in the
hearing by telephone.
the Court was able to reach the
he initially professed to
be unaware of the listing, or for that matter that the substantive proceedings
were still on foot, and
unaware of the purpose of the Court making contact with
him. That was disingenuous in circumstances where the order [from] February
2025, specifically listing the hearing before me and granting him leave to
participate in the hearing by telephone, was accessed
by him on the morning of
[the day after the order was made].
husband similarly professed to be unaware that the proceedings were later listed
for trial, when that was also expressly noted
in the orders [from] February 2025
that he had accessed. This trial date was also noted in the previous
orders made by Chief Judge
Sutherland [in] December 2024 and a
subsequent letter sent to the parties [in late] December 2024, both of
which the husband had
accessed the same day they were published.
the hearing, I confirmed for the husband that the trial is listed to commence in
Regional Circuit A [in] [month] 2025. He
indicated in fairly colourful
terms that he does not have time for, nor does he intend to participate in, the
proceedings in this
Court, which were commenced by his own application. He
specifically referenced the arrangements for the children of the marriage,
[Child A], born [in] 2014 and [Child B], born [in] 2016, while maintaining the
position he had earlier expressed that those arrangements
would not change and
that he does not seek any parenting orders. I reminded him that he has an
application on foot seeking orders
for alteration of property interests.
explained also that the hearing [in] [month] 2025 had been listed primarily for
his benefit, and to ensure that I could meet my
obligation to him as a
self-represented litigant and place him in a position to make informed decisions
for himself.
Reeves] then terminated the call. The information and explanations I had
intended to give him during the hearing were not able
to be conveyed.
Accordingly,
I determined to take the somewhat unusual step of conveying those matters to him
in this judgment, so that notwithstanding
his actions during the hearing [in]
[month] 2025, he will have been provided with the relevant information and
explanations well
in advance of the listed trial.
are a number of matters appropriately to be raised.
The relief sought by the husband - the financial case
most recent indication, in a formal sense at least, of the relief sought by the
husband is contained in his Further Amended Form
1 Initiating Application filed
[in] [month] 2024. In one part of that document, the orders proposed are in the
following terms

document also made it clear that the husband did not intend to seek any
parenting orders.
in the same document, the orders earlier sought are repeated in the following
terms and expressed to be sought on a final
basis (produced verbatim):
be a 50/50 division of the matrimonial property such that the Applicant receives
50% of the net assets and the Respondent receives
50% of the net asset.
respondent [Ms Reeves] shall pay spousal maintenance to the applicant [Mr
Reeves] of $500 per week indexed at 2% in line with

the beginning of February every year. The applicant's income does not meet the
needs to care for the
children in the previous manner and is in need of
immediate financial redress to assist the children. This shall be backdated to

document went on to seek orders for the "immediate dismissal" of the then
appointed Independent Children's Lawyer [Solicitor
C]. It is unnecessary to
detail that matter further, as Solicitor C is no longer appointed in
the matter.
on the face of the one document, there is confusion as to just what orders for
alteration of property interests the husband
seeks. The matrimonial home
is not the only significant asset owned by the parties or either of them. In
one part of the document
the husband appears to be seeking an order for the sale
of the matrimonial home, and the equal division between the parties of the
proceeds of sale. In the other part of the document, he appears to be seeking a
broader albeit unspecified equal division of
the totality of the property of the
parties or either of them.
to the husband discontinuing his participation in the hearing [in] [month] 2025,
I had intended to draw those matters to his
attention and seek to clarify just
what final orders he would seek.
had also intended to remind him that the orders made [in] February 2025, which
he has accessed, require each party to file and
serve an up-to-date Minute of
the proposed final orders they seek by no later than 4.00 pm on [a date in]
[month] 2025. If, as I
perceive, the Further Amended Form 1 Initiating
Application filed [in] [month] 2024 does not accurately reflect the
orders he seeks
at trial, he will need to comply with that order and file an
up-to-date Minute by [a date in] [month] 2025.
The relief sought by the parties – the parenting
already noted, the documents most recently filed by the husband indicate that he
does not propose to seek any orders about the
parenting arrangements for Child A
and Child B. If in fact he wishes to seek parenting orders, he will need to
address that in the
Minute to be filed by [a date
in] [month] 2025.
to the husband discontinuing his participation in the hearing
[in] [month] 2025, I had intended to draw that, and another matter,
to his attention.
most recent indication of the final orders to be sought by the wife is contained
in a Minute of Proposed Final Orders filed by
her [in] February 2024.
In that Minute, she says that she seeks equal shared parental responsibility,
and that the children live
with her and spend time with the husband each
alternate weekend from after school Friday until 5.00 pm on Sunday. She
seeks various arrangements for school holidays, special occasions, and
a range of specific issues orders.
husband needs to be aware that simply by refusing to seek any parenting orders
himself, he cannot preclude the wife from pursuing
the parenting orders she
seeks. In that sense, his statements at various times that the current
parenting orders simply will not
change, or that the parenting proceedings in
this Court are over, are wrong.
the husband seeks to have any say in the orders to be made by this Court in
relation to the children, he will need to comply with
the order already referred
to by filing a Minute of Proposed Orders, and comply with the further orders
made [in] February 2025,
which require the parties to file updating trial
affidavits and an affidavit of each witness by no later than [a date
in] [month]
2025. As matters presently stand, absent that compliance
the husband would have no current evidence before the Court in relation
parenting case.
that situation to continue to trial, that would work significantly to the
disadvantage of the husband even if the only outcome
he seeks is that no
parenting orders be made.
The cross-examination ban
an order made [in] September 2024 at a hearing in which the husband
participated, Cohen J noted that the requirements of
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) ("the
") apply in these proceedings. The
published orders made that day set out clearly that:
(a) neither party is permitted to cross-examine the other
party personally;
(b) any cross-examination of either party must only be conducted by a legal
practitioner acting on behalf of the other party;
(c) the parties have available to them the Commonwealth Family Violence and
Cross-Examination of Parties Scheme; and
(d) a copy of the orders made would be provided by the Court to Legal Aid
Western Australia, which administers that scheme, and which
would also be
advised that both parties were unrepresented at that time.
attachment to the published orders contained all necessary information required
by the parties to ensure that they knew the steps
they had to take to apply for
assistance under the Commonwealth Family Violence and Cross-Examination of
Parties Scheme. The husband
accessed those published orders on 25
September 2024.
the husband is clearly aware that any cross-examination of the wife at trial may
only be conducted by a lawyer on his behalf,
and he is also aware of the
availability of the scheme which will provide a lawyer for him free of
this point, the husband has not sought to access the scheme. He has
expressed the view that he does not intend to cross-examine
the wife and that
accordingly there is no need for him to access the scheme.
the husband discontinued his participation in the hearing [in] [month]
2025, I had intended to explain to him the matters
which are now set out
Cross-examination
is central to the trial process. It has more than one purpose.
first purpose of cross-examination is to elicit information concerning relevant
facts or issues that is favourable to the person
on whose behalf the
cross-examination is conducted. The second purpose of cross-examination is to
cast doubt upon the accuracy of
the evidence given by the other
the husband's case, therefore, cross-examination of the wife would serve two
purposes - to seek to extract information or concessions
from the wife that are
unhelpful to his case. Both functions
are important. Neither will happen if
the wife is not cross-examined on behalf of the husband.
Accordingly,
if the husband chooses to put himself in a position where the wife cannot be
cross-examined on his behalf, that may
well put him at a serious disadvantage at
husband cannot rely in that regard on the wife being cross‑examined by the
Independent Children's Lawyer, even in relation
to the parenting case. The
Independent Children's Lawyer will not in any circumstance direct
cross-examination to the financial
the husband wishes the wife to be cross-examined at trial, he will have to
engage a lawyer either privately or by accessing the
Commonwealth Family
Violence and Cross-Examination of Parties Scheme. If he chooses to access
the scheme, he simply needs to contact
Legal Aid Western Australia as previously
the husband chooses to take that step, he needs to do it within the next week or
two to maximise the possibility of a lawyer being
assigned to him in advance of
the husband does not choose to privately engage a lawyer and chooses not to
apply for assistance under the Commonwealth Family
Violence and
Cross-Examination of Parties Scheme, he will not be permitted to
cross-examine the wife at trial. He must also understand
that in those
circumstances it is almost certain that the trial will proceed as scheduled if
he either makes the choice just described,
or delays making any application for
assistance under the Scheme beyond the next couple of weeks. On the information
presently available,
and acknowledging that further relevant information may
become available, it is unlikely that any application by the husband for
trial to be vacated or adjourned would succeed.
the husband continued to participate in the hearing [in] [month] 2025, I
had intended to urge him to make the relevant application
under the Scheme
urgently, to give himself the best possible chance of having a lawyer assigned
to him for the purposes of trial,
so that the wife can be cross-examined
and his case can be presented in the best possible way. He will clearly be
at a disadvantage
if he does not.
Participation in the trial
also take this opportunity to make it clear to the husband that if he chooses
not to attend in person at the trial, which is listed
to commence at 10.00 am
[in] [month] 2025 at the Regional Circuit A Courthouse, then the trial will
continue in his absence.

timely fashion by filing a Form 2 Application and

the balance of convenience favours that over his personal attendance in
husband must understand however that the usual course is that parties are
required to attend in person at the trial of their
matter. I appreciate
that the husband has commitments, including to the care of the children, and
that personal attendance at trial
would cause him some inconvenience; frankly,
that is one of the reasons that the trial has been listed to take place in
Circuit A rather than in Perth. Almost all litigants experience
some level of inconvenience by having to attend court. The husband
also bear in mind that the court proceedings were commenced by him.
also make it clear to the husband that if he chooses not to participate in the
trial, and it continues therefore on an undefended
basis, none of the affidavit
material he has filed to date, nor any affidavit material he might choose to
file between now and trial,
will be received into evidence for the purposes of
trial. In those circumstances, the only evidence upon which the Court will be
able to base its decision will be that adduced at trial by the wife and by the
Independent Children's Lawyer.
matters having been addressed, the only order made at the conclusion of the
hearing [in] [month] 2025 (by which time the husband
had ended the telephone
call by which he was participating in the hearing) was:
proceedings stand adjourned to the trial already listed in the [Regional Circuit
A] [in] [month] 2025 at 10.00 am, unless a Status
Hearing is listed of the
presiding Judge's own motion prior to trial.
