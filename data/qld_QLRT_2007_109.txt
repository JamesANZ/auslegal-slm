Australian Gold Corporation
(the miner) currently holds ML20240. The mining lease was
originally granted on 1 August 1996 for a period of 10 years. On 11 January
2006 a previous owner of the Mining Lease lodged an application for renewal of
the mining lease for a term of 10 years with the Mining
Registrar, Mareeba
The lease is located on a
property owned by Ronald Norton Reddicliffe (the landholder). Access to the
lease is through the landholder’s
property. The renewal is for the
purpose of mining for gold, silver ore, mercury ore, quartz/quartzite/silica and
building stone--slate.
The lease area is
Tribunal Practice Direction
On 5 April 2007 the Tribunal
sent letters to the miner and the landholder bringing the referral of this
matter to the Tribunal by
the Mining Registrar to their attention, and advising
them of their obligations under Practice Direction 1 of 2003. Timeframes for
the submission of relevant material were provided to each party, with the final
material due by 11 June 2007. Neither party has
complied in any way with the
Tribunal Practice Direction. Accordingly, the only relevant material available
to the Tribunal to determine
compensation is that which the Mining Registrar
It is not an uncommon
occurrence for either or both parties in a compensation matter before the
Tribunal to fail to comply with Practice
Direction 1 of 2003. Mining Referee
Windridge has determined a matter in circumstances which mirror those before me,
and I adopt
the analysis of the legislative provisions, compensation principles
and methodology applied by Mining Referee Windridge in that case,
& Ors & Evans
[2006] QLRT
Determination
The Mining Registrar has
provided a copy of the Department of Natural Resources and Water QVAS Property
Details Report for the landholder’s
property which shows the unimproved
valuation, valuation date 1 October 2005, in the sum of $165,000.00 for the
3,250 hectare property.
Using the unimproved valuation, and assuming the land
subject to the mining lease is of an average standard for the property, the
unimproved value of the mining lease land equates to $50.77 per hectare.
Although the purpose of the unimproved valuation is not
for determining
compensation under the
Mineral Resources Act
(the Act), given the
absence of any other evidence, I am prepared to accept the value of the land as
at 1 October 2005 to be,
up, $51.00 per hectare. Further, absent any
evidence that I can rely on as to any change in value subsequent to that date,
$51.00 per hectare for the purposes of this determination.
As the material provided by
the Mining Registrar shows that the mining is to be by way of open cut method
with related infrastructure,
and absence any evidence, I am prepared to accept
that the loss suffered by the landholder will equate to a total loss of the
I further note that there would seem to have been little disturbance to
the land during the 10 years prior to the application for
renewal of the mining
lease, but that open cut mining is expected to occur shortly after renewal,
given that the mining lease is
Taking into account all
heads of compensation in
subsection 3
of the Act, I assess compensation
in the sum of $51.00 per
hectare, which for 16 hectares equates to $816.00.
Doing the best that
I can with the limited material before me, I award the
sum of $100.00 for access, taking into account that the access
appears to be quite lengthy, making a total award of $916.00. Pursuant
of the Act, I award the additional sum of
Taking all relevant factors
into account, I order that the miner pay the total compensation of $1,007.60 to
the landholder within
two months from notification of the renewal of the mining
lease by the Mining Registrar.
In this matter, it is worth
noting that the Mining Registrar’s referral to the Tribunal occurred on 5
April 2007, and that the
parties were written to that same day by Tribunal staff
advising of a timeline for written material and submissions which was set
conclude on 11 June 2007. As already indicated, nothing was received from
either party.
On 8 August 2007 President
Koppenol allocated this matter to myself, and the decision was completed by 17
August, with delivery on
20 August 2007. Given that Tribunal records will show
this matter as having been ‘reserved’ from the time of allocation
until handing down of the decision, and taking into account two weekends and a
public holiday, this would appear, statistically,
to be another example of
speedy resolution by the Tribunal. However, statistics can be illusionary. The
fact is that over 4 months
have elapsed from the time of referral by the Mining
Registrar to allocation of the matter by the President, with no material being
received by the Tribunal in that time to assist the decision-making process.
Unfortunately, as noted by both myself and Mining Referee
Windridge in other
compensation matters, there are an alarming number of matters where little or no
worthwhile material is received
by the Tribunal following the procedure set out
in Practice Direction 1 of 2003. Given the complexities of the Act; the
high cost of expert valuation evidence; and the time and other
constraints of miners and landholders, this is hardly surprising,
particularly
with respect to ‘small scale’ mining
operations.
In my view, the procedures
of Practice Direction 1 of 2003 should be urgently reviewed in order to find an
efficient system which
better meets the interests of miners and landholders in a
more timely manner, with a process designed to result in more meaningful
material being provided to the Tribunal, particularly in ‘small
scale’ mining operations. For instance, had a short
hearing’ been held in this matter a couple of weeks after referral, it
could reasonably be anticipated that
more useful evidence would have been before
the Tribunal, and the matter could have been concluded in May instead of August.
such a system may on ‘bare statistics’ give the
impression that the matter is ‘reserved’ for a longer period,
the reality of a timely disposal of the matter by the Tribunal would be quite
the opposite.
