Immunity from civil
1.102 Clause 16 of the bill provides limited immunities from civil
proceedings for a member of the Parole Board, staff assisting the
Board, and any
person who is providing information as requested or required by an authorised
1.103 Subclauses 16(1) and 16(2) provide that a member of the Board or a
person assisting the Board under subsection 15(1) are not
liable to civil
proceedings in relation to an act done, or omitted to be done, in good faith for
the exercise of the Board’s
functions or assisting the Board,
respectively. Subclause 16(3) also provides that persons who provide information
to an authorised
officer in response to a request for information made under
clause 25 are not liable to civil proceedings in relation to providing
information.
1.104 This therefore removes any common law right to bring an action to
enforce legal rights (for example, a claim of negligence or
defamation), unless
it can be demonstrated that lack of good faith is shown. The committee notes
that in the context of judicial
review, bad faith is said to imply the lack of
an honest or genuine attempt to undertake a task. Proving that a person has not
in good faith will therefore involve personal attack on the honesty of a
decision-maker. As such, the courts have taken the position
that bad faith can
only be shown in very limited circumstances.
1.105 The explanatory memorandum relevantly provides:
This clause ensures that members of the Board, persons made available to the
Board, and persons who provide information to the Board
can perform their
functions and duties under the Parole Board Bill without fear of personal
liability for any actions they perform
in good faith. Without immunity from
civil proceedings, these individuals may be exposed to civil liability in the
performance of
their duties.
It is important to note that while members and persons made available to the
Board are immune from civil proceedings, they do not
operate with impunity in
relation to these functions. A member’s appointment may be terminated,
including for misbehaviour
or failing to disclose interests (see clause 40).
Staff made available to the Board are subject to performance management under
employment and to the APS Code of
1.106 The committee notes that the independence of the Board and its members
in deciding on the conditional release of federal offenders
and other detainees
would be supported by immunity from civil liability.
1.107 Further, the committee notes that neither the bill nor the explanatory
memorandum clarifies whether the immunity is intended
to extend to the
Commonwealth as a whole, or whether the Commonwealth would remain vicariously
liable for the actions of the Board,
its staff, or a person responding to a
request under clause 25. Courts have generally taken the view that, in the
absence of any
express provision to the contrary, the intention of Parliament is
for such immunities to extend to the Commonwealth as a
1.108 The committee’s position is that it is appropriate for the
Commonwealth to remain liable for the actions of its officers
and delegates,
even those taken in good faith, where there is likely to be an adverse impact on
an individual’s rights and
liberties. This is to ensure appropriate
avenues of recourse are available for affected individuals who are prevented
from bringing
claims for damages against officers of the Commonwealth.
1.109 The committee notes that decisions concerning the conditional
release of an offender or other person from detention have serious
implications
for individual liberty and personal rights. Accordingly, the committee is
concerned that extending civil immunity to
the Commonwealth in its entirety may
unduly restrict access to appropriate avenues for remedy. The committee seeks
the minister’s
advice as to:
whether it is intended that the immunity from civil liability in
clause 16 will extend to the Commonwealth as a whole;
if the immunity is intended to apply to the Commonwealth as a
whole, the justification for this; and
what recourse is available to affected individuals who have their
right to bring a claim removed as a result of the immunity.
Broad discretionary
1.110 Clause 17 of the bill seeks to provide that the procedure to be
followed by the Board is as determined by the Chair. Subclause
18(4) further
provides that the Board may regulate proceedings at its meetings as it considers
appropriate. The Board’s discretion
to regulate its meetings is subject to
the provisions of that Division and any guidelines issued by the Chair relating
to the procedures
of the Board. Guidelines issued by the Chair may address
matters such as the Board’s constitution in specific matters or classes
matter, meeting logistics, procedures and recordkeeping, conflict of interest
procedures, and the functions of the Chair and Deputy
While not a legislative
instrument, these guidelines may be published by the Chair if considered
appropriate.
1.111 The explanatory memorandum states:
163. Subject to the requirements set out in this Part, it is intended that
the Board determine the procedures to be followed to make
efficient and
effective independent, risk-informed decisions about the conditional release and
management of federal offenders and
other detained persons.
164. This extends to the procedures to be followed to ensure that federal
offenders and other detained persons are afforded procedural
fairness. The
exercise of powers conferred on the Board by Part IB of the Crimes Act are
subject to the requirements of procedural
fairness. It is entirely a matter for
the Board to determine the procedures that will afford procedural fairness and
avoid any unfairness
or injustice, including when making parole
1.112 The committee acknowledges that, in general, it is appropriate as a
matter practice for administrative bodies to determine their
own procedures,
provided that requirements of procedural fairness are upheld. However, decisions
regarding parole and other conditional
release arrangements assume considerable
significance, as they directly affect an individual’s personal liberty and
from arbitrary detention. Accordingly, the procedure by which an
offender’s right to a fair hearing is upheld in parole and
proceedings acquires heightened significance, given the serious consequences
that any procedural defect or inequity may have
for their liberty.
1.113 Typically, what will amount to a fair hearing will include that a
person understands the procedural context in which they will
be afforded the
opportunity to present evidence and arguments in support of their position. In
this regard, it is not apparent on
the face of the bill, or from the explanatory
memorandum, how certain procedural aspects are intended to operate.
1.114 In particular, the explanatory memorandum is silent about the basis for
ensuring the Chair a broad discretion whether or not
to issue procedural
guidelines, and, where they are issued, to publish them such that they are
available to those being considered
for parole. Further, the explanatory
memorandum does not address the consequences, if any, should the Board fail to
comply with any
procedures set out in the guidelines. The committee’s
examination would accordingly be assisted by further detail as to the
transparency, accessibility, and enforceability of procedural arrangements
governing parole and related decisions, including the
role of guidelines, the
publication of procedural rules, and the consequences of non-compliance.
1.115 The committee therefore requests the minister’s advice as
whether the Chair is required to issue procedural guidelines under
clause 13 and, if not, why their discretion to do so is necessary
appropriate;
why the bill does not require the publication of procedures where
they have been set out in guidelines issued under clause 13 (so
as to facilitate
a fair hearing); and
what legal or practical consequences (if any) would follow from a
decision of the Board not to comply with procedures set out in guidelines
under clause 13.
