features of the crisis model that Charlesworth identified.

and awe further supporting the call to enlarge the frame of our inquiry in
international law.
II THE CRISIS MODEL: THEN
In ‘A Discipline of Crisis’, Charlesworth identified two types of
limitations of the crisis model.
The first limitation is that the approach rests on the ‘contentious
construction of crises’, assuming in the process

straightforward.
In the case

Treaty Organization intervention in Kosovo
as ‘humanitarian’ in
character was treated as an ‘uncontroversial and factual
description’.
To that end, she observed that international lawyers ‘typically do not
report on the basis of their own experiences and lives’
‘facts’ we use are ‘gathered from the media, government
reports and other sources’ without ‘weighing
up competing
This aspect of the crisis model has changed in the last two decades. The rise
of misinformation, exacerbated by social media and artificial
intelligence,
means that we tend to be more sceptical of “facts” these days:

Institute’.
scepticism does not necessarily translate into a commitment to independent and
rigorous fact-finding.
Relatedly, Charlesworth noted that the crisis model of international law is
also characterised by a ‘[l]ack of analytic

The second type of limitation is the ethical cost of crises. According to

gazes beyond the next election and even beyond the next generation.
For the purposes of this lecture, I define “an epoch approach to
international law” as having three features — the
Ls”: (1) long-term view, (2) linkages and (3) lateral thinking. This
approach does not overcome the problems with
the crisis model that Charlesworth
identified, but it does mitigate some of them and generates some new ways of
approaching our world
and our discipline. Let me elaborate on each of these
features with some examples.
First, the long-term view. In his recent article ‘Project 2100: Looking
Back, Looking Forward’, Sir Daniel Bethlehem,
former Legal Adviser to the
United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office, urges us to focus on the longer

need a sense of direction that is focused

established can, at any moment, and on the basis of a continuously available
process, be called in question ... Such
a process could continue indefinitely,
and finality would never be reached so long as possible errors still remained to
be discovered.
Such a frontier, so far from being stable, would be completely
precarious.
The second feature of the epoch approach is linkages. This operates on two
levels. First, there is a constant interaction between
domestic and
international systems on a vertical axis as well as between those systems on a
horizontal level. Domestic practice can
and does shape international law, and
international law is received in different ways into domestic practice. It is a
dynamic process.
epoch approach makes linkages between groups — it is diverse and inclusive
— and has a democratising impulse.
Making linkages may include building
unlikely coalitions. My example here is the partnership between the Clooney

progress, the United Nations has estimated that child marriage will take 300
years to eradicate worldwide.
But the Clooney-Obama-French Gates alliance aims to change that — they
want to wipe it out in less than a
generation.
The third feature is lateral thinking. An epoch approach calls for
reimagining how things are. An epoch is, after all, a period marked
development, not stasis. But revolution may not serve the long-term view, nor
maintain the linkages that need to be created and
nurtured. I suggest an
effective method for the epoch approach is “incremental creativity”

IV CASE STUDY OF THE
RUSSIAN FEDERATION’S AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE

aggression against Ukraine, a crisis that has occupied international

Moreover, the crisis-driven
emphasis on the war has perhaps led international lawyers to overlook some other
aspects of the conflict.
It was therefore welcome that the International
Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against President Vladimir Putin for the
war crime of the deportation and transfer of children: around 20,000 children
have been forcibly removed.
Though this too does not come close to capturing the range of violations that
President Putin is responsible for, it has led to advocacy
for a special
tribunal for aggression, possibly based on an agreement between Ukraine and the
Council of Europe.
In the words
of Charlesworth, this crisis has become the ‘heroic mission’ of many
international lawyers.
What could an epoch approach bring to this case? On a long-term view, the

As lawyers, we are taught to focus on the case, dispute or crisis: to get
instructed, rigorously represent the client and then move
on to the next case.

mindset if we are to make meaningful contributions in
the current epoch.

that while crises are painful, they ultimately reveal ‘our needs and
aspirations for change’

One example is the way that
Ukraine has been replaced by Gaza in the discourse in 2023–24: see, eg,
John Raine, ‘Ukraine
vs Gaza’ (2024) 66(1)
Samuel Ramani, ‘Russia Asks: How to Benefit from the Gaza War?’,

https://cepa.org/article/russia-asks-how-to-benefit-from-the-gaza-war/
archived at <

>. One of the
interesting elements of this has been the way that ideological coalitions among
international lawyers have formed
and reformed as each new crisis emerges.
People who were in furious agreement over Ukraine are now in furious
disagreement over Gaza
(such as on the proper role of the International Criminal
Court): James A Goldston, ‘Don’t Let Gaza Be Another Example
International Criminal Court Double Standards’,

be seen to result in a common approach to each crisis being undermined as a new
crisis causes the coalition to fracture.

One can also nurture
enthusiasm by engaging in a process that one loves, even if it seems immediately
futile. A recommitment to the
basic processes of international law, in full
cognisance of the situation as presently constructed, frees us from outside
and the perpetual threat of nihilism. ‘This universe henceforth
without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each
atom of that
stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a
world. The struggle itself toward the heights
is enough to fill a man’s
heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy’: Albert Camus,

McRae, ‘The International Trading System: Looking to 2100’ in Daniel
Bethlehem et
The Oxford Handbook of International Trade Law
University Press, 2
ed, 2022) 1065, 1066: ‘The notion of a
“rules-based international order” has for decades been the
cornerstone of
efforts to shape the international trading system — broadly
conceived to include not only trade in goods and services, and
their associated
legal framework, but also monetary and development policy, investment, and
everything more that oils transnational
economic interaction across sovereign
boundaries. Our rules-based international order, however, remains an
accommodation to Westphalia,
even as it endeavours to shrink and ameliorate the
effects of segmenting national policies, to manage disputes that arise between
them, and to address the challenges that are perceived, even if still debated,
on the approaching horizon.’

‘This case is the

government — not just
one Minister or agency — has a duty to protect
people from climate harm ... Uncle Pabai and Uncle Paul ... argue that by
to prevent climate change the Australian Government has unlawfully
breached its duty of care, because of the severe and lasting harm
that climate
change would cause to their communities. They are seeking an order from the
