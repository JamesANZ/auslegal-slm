SOUTH AUSTRALIA POLICE
Introduction
is an application by Stephen John Ragless (‘the complainant’)
seeking discovery and production of all documents relating
to the complainant in
the possession of the South Australian Police (‘the
respondent’).
accordance with the Tribunal’s pre-hearing procedures the respondent has
provided the complainant with the documents referred
to in its List of Documents
which it filed on 21 October 2015. The complainant says that the List is
deficient and that the respondent
should be required to provide him with all the
documents relating to him which it has in its possession.
his Complaint, issued on 20 November 2013, the complainant asserted that he had
been discriminated against by the respondent and
victimised for being a
whistleblower ‘
Due to my actions to exposed (sic) a dangerous incident
on a Firearms Range. Individuals, the club involved (being the South Australian
Field & Game Association Southern Branch) and the Firearms Branch have
colluded to victimise me and damage my credibility to
hide these issues.
Recent threatening and obscene text messages, unwarranted police action and
the timing of civil action by one
of the clubs officials has caused me to call
for any protection the Whistleblowers Act can offer
The Complaint and the Respondent’s Answer
Complaint has been particularised on a number of occasions. Although it has not
been easy to distill the precise nature, parameters
and details of the
Complaint, it would appear to be as follows.
15 September 2012 an incident occurred where the complainant alleges that he was
verbally abused by a Peter Perry, the then Secretary
of the Southern Branch of
the South Australian Field & Game Association. The complainant reported
that incident initially to
members of the Association and later, on
15 October 2012, to the South Australia Police.
complainant asserts that after he made these disclosures to the respondent, a Mr
Stringer, the then Secretary of the State Association
committed an offence by
providing false and misleading information about the complainant’s mental
health and his suitability
to hold a firearms licence to the respondent.
complainant says that the respondent, ‘by way of reprisal’, refused
to investigate or investigate properly his report.
respondent, in its
to the Complaint, as particularised,
not investigating the complainant’s allegation against Mr Stringer was
unrelated to the disclosures on 15 October 2012
did not investigate the allegation that Mr Stringer had committed an offence
under section 28 of the Firearms Act because a
reasonable suspicion could not be
formed that Mr Stringer knowingly provided information that was false and
misleading in a material
particular. Indeed, in the weeks following the
complainant’s disclosures, SAPOL were provided with medical reports
not contradict the information Mr Stringer provided to SAPOL; and
recommended
the complainant’s licence remain suspended until a more clear diagnosis
could be made.
denies the complainant has suffered any detriment for the purposes of section
9(4) of the WPA. If the complainant has suffered
detriment, it was not caused by
SAPOL not investigating the offence alleged to have been committed by Mr
Stringer or any act or omission
Issues for Determination in the Hearing
issues which appear to be joined between the parties and which therefore call
for determination at the hearing would appear to
comprise the issues articulated
by the respondent in a letter to the complainant on 14 September 2015,
light of the above, the issues at trial will be as follows:
7.1 Whether the disclosures you made on 15 October 2012
(to SAPOL about the false report) and 30 October 2012 (to the Police Ombudsman)
were appropriate disclosures of public interest information for the purpose of
7.2 Whether SAPOL refused to investigate the claim and if so, was that refusal a
reprisal (or in retaliation) for you making the
disclosures on 15 October and 30
October 2012.
7.3 Whether the actions of SAPOL in refusing to investigate the claim caused you
7.4 Whether any detriment suffered by you was caused by
the background of these issues the respondent filed and served the following
List of Documents which it says are the only
documents in its possession which
are relevant to the issues identified above, namely:
from Mr Ragless to SAPOL Firearms Branch dated 15 October 2012.
of complaint to Police Ombudsman dated 30 October 2015.
of Nicole Johnson (Psychologist) dated 7 November 2012.
of Dr Iris Minkiewicz (Psychiatrist) dated 5 November 2012.
from Darian Stringer to Angelo Pippos (SAPOL) dated 9 October 2012.
PD486C signed by Darian Stringer dated 12 October 2012.
from Mr Ragless to Doug Riach (SAPOL) and Angelo Pippos (SAPOL) dated 14
November 2012.
from Mr Ragless to Angelo Pippos (SAPOL) dated 15 November 2012.
am not in a position to know the extent or otherwise of other documents (if
indeed there are any) in the possession of the respondent
which may be relevant
to the issues in this hearing.
complainant’s application is, in effect, an application for further and
better discovery. The Equal Opportunity Tribunal
Rules are generally silent on
this issue. I note, however, that they do provide, in such a situation, for the
Tribunal to give specific
directions as to the procedure to be followed.
seems to me to be not unreasonable, in these circumstances, to adopt the
approach followed by the Supreme Court on applications
of this nature.
Harris Scarfe Ltd (in liq) v Ernst & Young (No
Bleby J said:
This is an application for further and better discovery.
Rule 58.04 provides that the Court may order further and better discovery
‘where it appears to the Court that there are grounds for a belief that
some document or class of documents relating to any
mater in question in the
proceedings may be or may have been in the possession, custody or power of a
Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (In Liquidation) v Arthur
Andersen & Co (No.5)
referred to the ‘uncompromising ethical obligation’ that a legal
practitioner acting for a party has to the Court to
make true and honest
disclosure of documents, such that the Court can rely on the assertion by the
practitioner that the party has
or has had no other documents which require
discovery. A party’s list of documents is generally conclusive. I repeat
Southern Equities Corporation Ltd (In Liquidation) v Arthur
Andersen & Co (No.5):
What acceptance of the assertion of the plaintiff’s solicitor does mean,
however, is that if the defendant is to succeed in
its application, it must
point to some evidence to raise the necessary belief required by
Rule 58.04(e). It requires more than merely
an assumption or speculation
that such documents may exist. The necessary belief may be formed from an
examination of the pleadings.
Common experience may dictate that there must
have been a particular relevant document in the custody, possession or power of
party concerning a particular transaction. The existence of a relevant
document may be properly inferred from the contents of another
Alternatively, the description of a document or class of documents by the
respondent party may be so vague and uncertain
as to require more particularity.
There may be other circumstances which induce the necessary belief. However,
the Court will not
act on speculation.
issues in this case involving documents which are likely to be in the
respondent’s possession would seem to me to be those
relating to the
complainant’s letter of disclosure, any documents emanating from Mr
Stringer to the respondent, any documents
in response from the respondent to
either Mr Stringer or other officials of the Association or the Branch and
the correspondence
and reports passing between the psychologists or
psychiatrists and the respondent.
documents in the respondent’s list fall into that category. I do not
apprehend that discovery should be wider or extend
to documents in categories
outside the categories covering the documents already disclosed. I certainly
would not expect it to include
documents from any and all sources whatsoever
merely because they related to the complainant.
way of response the complainant simply asserts that, as a matter of fairness, he
should have access to ‘everything in his
file’ and ‘there must
be more documents’ than those provided by the respondent’s
representative, Mr White.
my view, something more than a mere assertion of this nature is required. These
assertions are nothing more than invitations to
the Court to act on speculation.
Without more I am entitled to rely on the ‘uncompromising ethical
obligation’ imposed
on Mr White to make true, honest and appropriate
disclosure of the documents in the respondent’s possession relevant to the
issues to be determined. There is nothing before me to suggest that the
obligation has not been discharged.
Accordingly,
the application for further discovery is
