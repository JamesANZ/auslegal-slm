Introduction
Full Commission of the Industrial Relations Commission of South Australia
(“the Commission”) listed the following
for hearing on 4 July
an application
by SA Unions to increase rates of pay and allowances in awards of the Commission
under s 90 of the
Fair Work Act 1994
(“the Act”);
an application
by SA Unions to review the Minimum Standard for Remuneration (“the
MSR”) under s 69(3) of the Act; and
proceedings
initiated by the Commission pursuant to s 100 of the Act to allow for the
granting of an increase in rates of pay and
allowances in awards of the
Commission.
Unions also sought an increase in the minimum amount payable to an employee to
whom Special national minimum wage 2 applied under
the National Minimum Wage
Order 2016.
applications by SA Unions were lodged on 6 June 2016 following a decision
delivered on 31 May 2016 by the Minimum Wage Panel of
the Fair Work Commission
(“the FWC Panel”) after the
Annual Wage Review
was conducted under
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth) (“the FWA 2009”). The FWC Panel
determined that there be a 2.4% increase in modern award rates of pay effective
from the first full pay period on or after 1 July 2016 and a corresponding
increase in the national minimum wage from the same date.
The resultant new
national minimum wage is $672.70 per week or $17.70 per hour, an increase of
$15.80 per week to the weekly rate.
Unions lodged written submissions in support of its application. The Minister
for Industrial Relations, the Chief Executive, Department
of Premier and Cabinet
(“the DPC”) and the Local Government Association (“the
LGA”) filed responding submissions.
In light of the FWC Panel decision and
other considerations relevant to employees affected by the proposed increase,
the responding
submissions supported the granting of a 2.4% increase to the
awards of the Commission and to the MSR with an operative date being
pay period on or after 1 July 2016, and the implementation of the award
adjustments by a declaration pursuant to s 100
light of the consent to the SA Unions application, and having regard to the
applicable statutory principles, and the economic and
employment data referred
to below, the Commission was satisfied that it should grant the proposed
increases, and dispensed with the
need for the parties to make oral submissions.
Accordingly,
on 1 July 2016, the Commission made a declaration and issued orders under s
100(3)(a) of the Act giving effect to a 2.4%
increase in award rates from the
first pay period on or after 1 July 2016, and for the establishment of an MSR
increased by 2.4%
under s 69(3)(a) of the Act. This has resulted in an increase
in the applicable pay rates from $668.80 per week to $684.90 per week,
increasing the hourly rate for a 38 hour week from $17.60 per hour to $18.02 per
hour. The Commission also ordered that there
be an increase in the supported
wage from $81 per week to $82 per week.
provide brief reasons for our satisfaction that the proposed increases are
warranted and are consistent with the objects of the
The relevant provisions of the Act
objects are set out in s 3 of the Act. The following passages from the
State Wage Case and Minimum Standard for Remuneration
guide our approach to
the proceedings in light of those objects:
“The objects of
the Act of particular relevance to the present exercise concern the provision of
awards that are relevant, flexible
and expressed in non-technical language; the
maintenance of an effective safety net of fair and enforceable conditions for
the performance
of work by employees (including fair wages); encouraging
enterprise agreements that are relevant, flexible and expressed in non-technical
language; and promoting and facilitating employment and security in employment.
The objects directed to the promotion of goodwill in industry and of the
general welfare of the people of South Australia would appear
to have less
relevance in view of the limited scope and impact of any increase we award,
although regard must always be had to economic
circumstances.”
also have had regard to s 69(3) of the Act with respect to the need for the
annual establishment of an MSR, to s 73(a) and (c)
relating to encouraging and
facilitating the making of enterprise agreements and the need to ensure that
award remuneration operates
as a safety net underpinning negotiation of
agreements, and to s 100 relating to the circumstances in which the Commission
a declaration adopting a decision or determination of the FWC
Economic data and the employment profile
general economic context in which the industry sectors within our jurisdiction
operate must be considered by reference to the
most recent economic data. This
in turn is relevant to our consideration of the decision of the FWC Panel, which
is the basis of
our declaratory jurisdiction under s 100(1) of the Act.
Economic data enables the Commission to assess the impact of any increase
real wages of employees, to consider the level of any increase against general
community wage movements, and to do so with
an understanding of the prevailing
economic climate and the likely impact on employers.
FWC Panel, in each of its annual reviews, engages in a rigorous and
comprehensive analysis of contemporaneous international and
national economic
data. Whilst there are contextual differences, the 2016 decision of the FWC
Panel traverses considerations similar
to those which must be taken into account
by the Commission in these proceedings in accordance with its statutory
determining to grant an increase of 2.4% to modern awards and the national
minimum wage, the FWC Panel took into account the modern
awards objective and
the minimum wages objective of the FWA
The FWC Panel observed that
the legislation required that it exercise a broad judgment and have regard to
relevant statutory considerations
and a range of matters including but extending
beyond economic considerations. It concluded that the matters of direct
to the review could, generally speaking, be grouped into three broad
categories: economic; social; and collective
bargaining.
terms of economic considerations, the FWC Panel considered that
Australia’s economic performance remained generally positive
with expected
increases in Gross Domestic Product and employment and reductions in levels of
unemployment, and below average wage
growth and inflation. It was noted that
there was a continuing transition towards broader growth following the passing
of the resource
investment boom.
social considerations, the Panel remained of the view that modest and regular
increases in minimum wages would not have a measurable
adverse impact on
employment, and that an increase was needed to take into account relative living
standards and the needs of the
As to bargaining, the FWC
Panel had regard to the need to encourage collective bargaining, although it was
unable to predict the
impact of any increase in this
has been noted in previous decisions of this
Commission,
although there is some
degree of consistency between the broad categories addressed by the FWC Panel,
and the matters to which we
must have regard under the objects of the Act, the
context for our consideration is significantly different. Matters such as the
level of sophistication of industrial relations within the sectors covered by
the State jurisdiction, as reflected in an entrenched
culture of enterprise
bargaining and a small number of award-reliant employees, means that the
economic and social impact of any
increase in award and non-award wages is
substantially more confined than in the Federal jurisdiction. Accordingly, the
the Act to encourage enterprise bargaining has more limited relevance.
profile of employees within the State jurisdiction and the number of employees
who may be reliant on minimum award rates or the
MSR rates has not altered in
any material respect over the last 4-5 years.
most recent data tendered on behalf of the DPC revealed that as at June 2015
there were approximately 104,070 public sector employees

full-time equivalents.
advised that the proposed determination would not result in the award rate
exceeding the enterprise agreement rate in this
The number of public
sector employees who it was said might be reliant on minimum award rates or the
MSR was estimated at about 732.
17 The LGA provided updated schedules indicating that approximately 95 out of
10,254 employees in local government would be affected
by or were in receipt of
The proposed increases
would not result in the minimum award rate exceeding rates in any related
enterprise agreement.
Schedules submitted by the DPC and the LGA indicate that, as over at least the
previous three years, the overall percentage of
award or MSR-reliant employees
who are or may be directly impacted by the increase granted by this Commission
remains at less than
1% of the total employees within the State jurisdiction,
and no more than 2% of LGA employees. This contrasts with a figure of 18.8%
awardreliant employees spread across a variety of industries within the
is an identifiable percentage of award or MSRreliant employees who will directly
benefit from the proposed increase. Further,
leaveloading provisions and some
allowances for public sector employees will be indexed in accordance with
minimum award rates. However,
as noted in the Minister’s
submission,
the direct impact of
the proposed increase is low. In our view its effect is not such as to require a
close sectoral analysis.
Economic outlook
20 The Minister filed an affidavit of Mr Wilson,
Director, Economic Strategy, in the
The affidavit provides a
broad economic overview with reference to international factors, the Australian
economy, the South Australian
economy, inflation and wages. It is not necessary
to summarise the contents. It is sufficient to observe that, whilst the outlook
in terms of growth for the State economy is mixed, and unemployment levels have
increased by 0.7% since a year ago, we do not consider
there to be any factors
of significance which count against the flow on in this State of the modest
increase granted by the FWC Panel.
FWC Panel noted that prevailing economic circumstances provided an opportunity
to improve the relative living standards of the
low paid and to enable them to
better meet their needs. Further, that an increase of 2.4% would not lead to
inflationary pressure
and was highly unlikely to have any measurable negative
impact on employment, and at the same time, would result in a modest improvement
in the real wages for those employees who are reliant on the National Minimum
Wage and modern award minimum
the qualifications mentioned above in relation to the differences in the State
as opposed to Federal employment profile, and
the more limited impact of
bargaining considerations in the State context, the same considerations should
be taken into account by
this Commission. It is our view therefore, having
regard to the objects of the Act, and the economic information available, that
adoption of the outcome of the FWC Panel decision resulting in an increase of
2.4% to award and MSR rates of pay is consistent with
our statutory charter. It
increases the real value of the wages received by award and MSR-reliant workers
and is not a disincentive
to enterprise bargaining.
2.4% increase will apply to State minimum award wages and the MSR from the first
full pay period commencing on or after 1 July
2016. Proportionate adjustments
will apply to juniors, apprentices and trainees. The adjustment in allowances
and services will be
in accordance with the 2015 State Wage Case
The minimum amount
payable to an employee who receives a supported wage will be increased to $82
per week also operative form the
first full pay period commencing on or after 1
July 2016. The increase will be applied to the relevant allowances and service
in the awards listed in Schedule 1 to the submission of the DPC.

these reasons, including relevant ancillary orders

any such rate, once increased, is less than the State
Minimum Award Wage, as
varied in accordance with paragraph 6 below, such rate will be varied to reflect
this rate ($684.90 per week).
proportionate adjustments are to apply to juniors, trainees and other
employees as set out in the relevant Award, subject to the result

order shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions
of the relevant
Award, or where the award is silent on the method of adjustment, such rates will
be increased by 2.4%.
the following terms be included in each Award:
of pay in this Award include the safety net adjustment payable under the 2016
State Wage Case and Minimum Standard
for Remuneration. This safety net
adjustment may be offset against any equivalent amount in rates of pay received
by employees whose
wages and conditions of employment are regulated by this
Award which are above the wage rates prescribed in the Award. Such above
payments include wages payable pursuant to enterprise agreements, currently
operating enterprise flexibility agreements, award
variations to give effect to
enterprise agreements and over award arrangements. Absorption which is contrary
to the terms of an agreement
is not required.
Increases made under the existing or previous State Wage Case principles,
previous General Reviews of Award Wages and the 2016 State
Wage Case and Minimum

temporarily or otherwise, reduce, postpone and/or phasein
the application of any
increase in labour costs flowing from the 2016 State Wage Case and Minimum
Standard for Remuneration on the
grounds of serious economic adversity. The
merit of such application will be determined in the light of the particular
circumstances

of the increase in labour costs is a significant factor to be taken
into account
in assessing the merit of any application. A party making such an application
must seek that the matter be referred

a Full Commission.
Any decision to temporarily postpone or reduce an increase will be subject to
a further review, the date of which will be determined
by the Commission at the
time it decides any application under this provision.
