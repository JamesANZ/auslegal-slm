Curran, Michael Anthony (Coroner Schapel)
Recommendation
- In the inquest into the death of a DCS prisoner,
Leonard Edward Dodson,
Court repeated an earlier recommendation that had been made in an inquest into
the death of another prisoner Franklin Delano
That recommendation was
directed to the issue of continuity of care within the prison health system. It
was as follows:
'That the Medical Director of the South Australian Prison Health Service
assign to a senior medical officer or officers within the
Service the
responsibility of maintaining oversight of the medical treatment and
investigation of those prisoners within institutions
operated by the Department
for Correctional Services who are suspected of suffering from a serious or life
threatening illness, especially
in circumstances where the medical treatment and
investigation of such prisoners is being conducted by medical practitioners who
are not employees of the Service'
The Court repeats that
recommendation

Hepatitis C was transformed on 1st March 2016 when new Direct Acting Antivirals
(DAA) became available in Australia
on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS),
including for prisoners who were identified as a priority group.
treatments provide an effective cure for Hepatitis C with medications

SA Prison Health
Service has in recent years successfully recruited additional Senior Medical
Practitioners, including to the country
prison sites, which therefore avoids the
need for reliance upon Locum Medical Practitioners. As such, this ensures
consistency of
care and oversight of the people in prison.
In addition, a
Nurse Practitioner with scope of practice to manage chronic disease has also
been employed. This role provides additional
support and oversight of medical
treatment for those patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses. There
are plans to increase
the number of Nurse Practitioners across SA Prison Health
Service in future budgets.
