World ports cooperate in combating climate change
New marine laws for PNG
by Mikhail Kashubsky
World ports cooperate in combating climate
The C40 World Ports Climate Conference was held in Rotterdam, 9-11 July 2008.
C40 is a world alliance of large cities dedicated to
the issue of global
Organised by the Port of Rotterdam and the Rotterdam Climate Initiative under
the support of the International Association of Ports
and Harbors (IAPH), the
Conference was attended by 55 ports from across the world.
The Conference adopted at its closing session the
World Ports Climate
Declaration
, in which the participating ports proactively committed
themselves to reduce CO2 emissions and improve air quality by developing
implementing their integrated programs.
The Declaration addresses the following main issues:
• reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ocean-going shipping;
• reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from port operations and
development;
• reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from hinterland transport;
• enhancement of the use of renewable energy;
• development and auditing of CO2 inventories.
Among distinguished guests addressing the audience were the Honourable Ivo
Opstelten, Mayor of Rotterdam, Mr Ruud Lubbers, former
prime minister of the
Netherlands (the conference chairman), and IMO Secretary-General Efthimos
Mitropoulos.
At the closing ceremony moderated by former IAPH President Pieter Struijs,
the Conference Director, IAPH President O.C. Phang made
a presentation entitled
‘World’s Ports and Challenge to Climate Change’, in which she
urged the world port community
to take action without delay, calling for a
worldwide and sustained approach to successfully contribute to abatement of the
warming and a close collaboration with IMO and other international
bodies, regional ports associations.
IAPH provided its full support in organisation of this conference by
encouraging its members to take part in it, in accordance with
‘Resolution on a world wide approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
ports’ adopted at mid-term Board meeting
in Dunkirk, France on 16 April
IAPH will continue to support the cause of this conference and take a leading
role in promoting the agreed actions. A follow-up meeting
to work on the agreed
actions will take place in November 2008 in the port city of Los Angeles,

New marine laws for PNG
Marine resources are of utmost importance to Australia’s closest
neighbour Papua New Guinea (PNG), which hosts some of the last
pristine coral reefs of the world, where coastal peoples are still reliant on
subsistence fishing for day-to-day survival,
and where ongoing development of
commercial fisheries forms a vital part of the country’s economic
These resources face a number of significant threats, including pollution
from ships. The country hosts a number of international
shipping lanes,
including the main transit routes between the major east coast ports of
Australia and commodity markets in north
Asia. There have been several
incidents in PNG resulting in pollution in recent years.
As part of efforts to address this threat, in 2008 Cairns-based EcoStrategic
Consultants was engaged by the PNG National Maritime
Safety Authority (NMSA),
through maritime law firm BWA, to develop new marine pollution legislation for
PNG. The new laws will implement
all of the relevant Conventions of the
International Maritime Organization (IMO), and provide PNG with a 21st Century
legal regime
for marine environment protection.
The drafting phase of the project was completed in November 2008, producing
five new Bills with four supporting Regulations, as follows:
Marine Pollution (Ships & Installations) Bill
Regulation,
implementing MARPOL and AFS Conventions,
Marine Pollution (Sea Dumping) Bill
Regulation,
implementing London Protocol,
Marine Pollution (Preparedness & Response) Bill
Regulation), implementing OPRC Convention, OPRC-HNS Protocol, Intervention
Convention and Intervention HNS Protocol,
Marine Pollution (Liability & Cost Recovery) Bill
Regulation,
implementing CLC 92, Fund 92, Supplementary Fund and Bunkers
Convention; and
Marine Pollution (Ballast Water Control) Bill
Regulation,
implementing Ballast Water Convention.
The project involved a comprehensive stakeholder consultation process, and
cabinet and parliamentary submission papers have been prepared
for both passing
of the Bills, and accession to those IMO marine environment protection
Conventions that PNG has not yet ratified.
If passed and implemented, the new
Bills will significantly increase protection of PNG’s vital coastal and
marine resources
from sea-based sources of pollution and related impacts, while
allowing the sustainable development of the maritime sector in PNG.
also assist in the protection for the vital sealane through Torres Strait, which
PNG shares with Australia, and which is
now part of the Great Barrier Reef
Particularly Sensitive Sea Area as declared by IMO.

MARION WARD
It is with regret that the Australian Association of Maritime Affairs (AAMA)
has accepted the resignation of Dr Marion Ward from its
Board. Dr Ward is one of
our longest serving Board members having been associated with the AAMA from the
earliest days of its predecessor,
the Australian Centre for Maritime Studies
Marion Ward is an applied geographer who was awarded a Distinguished New
Zealand Geographer Medal in July 2003 for her many achievements
"transformer of place". Between 1973 and 2002 she worked on or led 80 missions
to developing countries in Africa, Asia and the
Pacific, working at the
community, regional and national levels, to resolve transport, communication,
water supply and sanitation
issues. She has published extensively and worked as
a consultant since the early 1970s. Through her work she has impacted on
of people by making recommendations related to the improvement of their
living conditions. Her special interests in shipping and
community development
were clearly evident in the contributions she made as a long-term member of the
Boards of the AAMA and ACMS.
Over the years, Marion Ward has been a main stay of the association’s
publishing programme. In 1982, she was the co-editor of
Australia’s
Maritime Horizons in the 1980s,
the first in the series of
Papers in Maritime Affairs
that were published by ACMS through the 1980s and
which Marion co-edited. More recently, she was for many years the extremely
hard-working
and diligent Editor of
Maritime Studies.
We are extremely
appreciative of her efforts in helping to keep our publishing programme
We wish Marion Ward a long and happy retirement.
