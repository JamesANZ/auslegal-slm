WORDS IN SQUARE BRACKETS REPLACE WORDS USED IN
THE ORIGINAL JUDGMENT - PARTIES’ NAMES AND IDENTIFYING DETAILS HAVE BEEN
History prior to the current application
1 This is a long-standing
matter and the parties have litigated in this Court since late2009. The Court
file is currently in its
volume and shows no real signs of
abating. The last orders in this matter were made on 5 August 2013. Those
orders finalised the
proceedings at that stage. That set of proceedings had
commenced on 11 May 2011. The proceedings were between the mother and the
father of the child, [J Hobson] born [in] 2007. [J] is now seven years old.
Importantly, for today’s purposes, the maternal
grandmother was not a
party to those proceedings. The orders made on 5 August 2013 are attached to
these reasons.
2 The orders that, in my view, have particular relevance to the current
application are:
[6] Subject to any rules of the contact centre, the Respondent [the mother]
be permitted to be accompanied by extended family members
at supervised
[15] On a without admission basis, the maternal grandmother, [Mrs Kevins], be
restrained by injunction and an injunction is hereby
granted restraining her
from disrobing, undressing or otherwise being naked in the presence of the said

application on 14 November 2014. In that she seeks the same interim orders

parenting orders made 5 August 2013, being order 4, 5, 6 and 7, be and are
hereby discharged.
applicant grandmother spend time with the child of the marriage, [J Hobson],
born [in] 2007, on the first Sunday of each month
from 10.00am to 6.00pm.
Special events
applicant grandmother spend time with the child hereinafter, “[J]”
on his birthday, being:
(a) three hours if the birthday falls on a day during the school week and school
(b) four hours if the birthday falls on a weekend.
(a) In 2015 on Easter Sunday from 9.00am to 5.00pm;
(b) On Easter Monday from 9.00am to 5.00pm in the year 2016;
and thereafter alternating in the above pattern.
The applicant grandmother:
(a) spend the 2014 Christmas Day with [J] from 9.00am to 2.00pm in the year
(b) spend from 2.00pm to 6.00pm on Christmas Day in the year 2015 and therefore
alternating in the above pattern.
School contact
The applicant grandmother have liberty to attend all special school functions in
relation to [J] including but not limited to
open days, school assemblies,
special grandparents’ days and to receive newsletters and school
invitations from the school
at which the child is current enrolled and also a
copy of the child’s school report each semester. The applicant
grandmother
have leave to serve a copy of these orders on the child’s
school and any future school that he attends.
applicant grandmother and her solicitor have leave of the Court to receive
copies of the single expert witness three reports [sic]
in relation to [J] in
the former proceedings between the first and second respondent.
4 During the course of the hearing before me, the
grandmother’s counsel accepted that she cannot properly seek orders that
discharge orders in relation to the time that the mother spends with [J]. That
issue is up to the mother to deal with.
5 Perhaps because of the long history of this matter, the fresh application
by the maternal grandmother was hotly contested by the
father. The father is
the person who is responsible for [J] pursuant to the 2013 orders. One can
understand his extreme reluctance
to once again become embroiled in further
proceedings over [J’s] arrangements and his welfare. The father was
represented
by Senior Counsel who made forceful (albeit elegant) submissions
including detailed written submissions. The father’s position
is that the
grandmother’s application should be summarily dismissed. The chronology
filed by the father on 9 January 2015
provides a useful summary of the history
of the parties and this litigation. In particular, it details many events
occurring prior
to the final orders being made in 2013.
6 The case summary prepared by Senior Counsel for the father noted that [at
Although [Mrs Kevins] (the grandmother) was not a party to the litigation that
resulted in the order of 5 August 2013 finalising
the parenting arrangements for
[J], her involvement in [J’s] life was considered in some detail by the
Court and her future
involvement in his life was the subject of a Judicial
determination to the extent that provision was made for her to see [J] if she
accompanied the mother during her supervised visits to [J].
7 There are a number of issues arising from that paragraph:
(a) It is true that the maternal grandmother was not a party to the earlier
proceedings and did not seek orders in her own right;
(b) The comment that “her involvement in [J’s] life was considered
in some detail by the Court” requires some exploration.
The Court made
interim orders on 2 April 2013, which included a finalisation order. That
allowed the mother and the father (being
the parties to those proceedings) to
relist the proceedings by 2 August 2013 otherwise various interim orders
would become final
by default and the proceedings would be dismissed. No such
request to relist was made by either party in that time and therefore
orders were pronounced in Chambers on 5 August 2013 disposing of the
proceedings.
(c) It is difficult to accept that the Court considered the grandmother’s
role in [J’s] life “in some detail”
(d) The orders were directed to the mother’s time with [J]. The mother
was permitted to be accompanied by family members at
her supervised visits. The
issue of whether the grandmother could see [J] at other times (and not in the
mother’s presence)
was not an issue before the Court at the time and not
one therefore resolved by the Court.
8 Part 10.3 of the Family
Law Rules deals with applications for summary dismissal. Rule 10.12 provides
A party may apply for summary orders after a response has been filed if the
party claims, in relation to the application or response,
(a) the court has no jurisdiction;
(b) the other party has no legal capacity to apply for the orders sought;
(c) it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process; or
(d) there is no reasonable likelihood of success.
9 The Court
clearly has the power therefore to summarily dismiss an application if it falls
within those circumstances.
10 In this case, the father submits that the grandmother’s application
has no reasonably prospect of success. He also says
that further litigation is
not in [J’s] best interests. To that end the father relies upon the
principles in
Rice & Asplund
[1978] FamCAFC 128
(1979) FLC 90-725.
Senior Counsel for
the father’s submissions provide in summary the following [at page 8]:
It is not in [J’s] interest for [Mrs Kevin’s] application to proceed
further or at all, and in any event it discloses
no significant or material
change in circumstances sufficient to warrant revisiting the arrangements for
[J’s] welfare and
therefore has no reasonable (or realistic) prospect of
success – see
Rice & Asplund
McLean v Navi
[2012] FMCAFam 1025
11 The decision in
has evolved into a long-standing principle in which the Court
must firstly consider whether the principle is to be considered on a
preliminary
basis or one after a detailed investigation. In addition, the Court must, in
considering such a principle, still take
into account the best interests of
children and the various provisions such as the objects and principles of the
Act in coming to
its determination (see the views of Warnick J in
[2008] FamCAFC 16
(2008) FLC 93-363
and [65]). As Warnick J said at [81] in
Thus, in my view, when the threshold question described in
Rice & Asplund
is determined as a preliminary matter, it remains a determination “on
the merits”. Where an application is dismissed
at a preliminary stage, it
is not dismissed for some technical reason, such as the failure of the party to
appear or some lack of
compliance with form and procedure, but rather because,
assuming the evidence of the applicant is accepted, there is an insufficient
change of circumstance shown to justify embarking on a hearing. Though
sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will, or ought
be, about the
interests of the child in not being subjected to further litigation, is more
powerfully in the child’s welfare,
than to allow the application to
12 It is clear that the Court must, if determining
the matter at a preliminary stage, take the applicant’s case at its
and proceed on the basis that the evidence produced by the applicant is
correct. This view is also supported by the Full Court in
(2014) FLC 93-597
13 I am satisfied in this case that the principle should be decided on a
preliminary basis.
Rice and Asplund
principle is that there must be a sufficient
change in circumstances between the making of final orders in relation to
issues and the filing of fresh proceedings.
Miller & Harrington
[2008] FamCAFC 150
, the Full Court
considered an appeal by the mother against orders made by Barry J to
dismiss her fresh application on the basis of
the rule in
. At the original trial, Buckley J found, amongst other things,
and this is set out at [106] of the Full Court decision, that:
• the mother was unable to facilitate a positive relationship between the
children and the father;
• the mother was of the view that the children should choose for
themselves whether they see their father or not and, for example,
had told the
children in the waiting room of the report writer that they did not have to see
their father if they elected not to;
• each child had indicated to the report writer that they did not wish to
see their father;
• the mother had “over exposed” the children to the dispute.
The elder child made it clear she did not want any
• the children have been unduly and negatively influenced by the mother
and she was unable to facilitate a relationship between
the children and the
father while they resided with her;
• if the children were placed with the father they would experience
emotional and behavioural difficulties in the short term
as they learned to
• if the children did not reside with the father, contact orders would be
ineffectual; and
• in that eventuality, the relationship between the father and the
children would further deteriorate.
16 The Full Court accepted
that taking the mother’s case at its highest, the asserted changes of
circumstances appeared to
be [at 110] that:
• the father and his family denigrated the mother to the children which
had caused the elder child to leave the father’s
care (a matter which Mr
Page SC described before Barry J as “the most important” of the
changes that had occurred since
Buckley J’s judgment.);
• the mother had given birth to a child and a relationship had developed
between the children and that child and separation
from that child was “a
source of some anxiety”;
• the children left the father’s residence “unaided by either
of their parents” and had chosen to “go
back into hiding”;
• that action was an indication of the stress the children were under;
• the children were now aged 14 and 11 (as opposed to 12 and nine before
Buckley J).
17 In those circumstances, the Full Court found
that the matters said to be changes on behalf of the mother were in fact [at
manifestations of the fact that the central matters found
by Buckley J including the antipathy of the children toward
their father,
the difficulties his Honour would exist for the children on a
change in their residential care, the inability of the mother to promote
foster a relationship between the children and their father and the influence of
the mother’s attitudes on the wishes of
the children – continued to

was the subject of detailed consideration in
& Harrington

(2008) FLC 93-383
(2008) FLC 93363
Cortes & Cabrera
[2007] FMCAFam 293.
The Full Court acknowledged
that his Honour correctly accepted that the mother’s evidence should be
taken at its highest and
that the “threshold question” enunciated in
Rice & Asplund
is determined as a preliminary matter, and on the
merits. His Honour also made it clear that he would assume that the evidence of
the mother is accepted in order to assess whether there was a sufficient change
of circumstances to justify embarking on a hearing.
20 His Honour referred to the above-mentioned quote by Warnick J in
21 Senior Counsel for the father takes the above argument further by
submitting that [on page 2 of his summary]:
[Mrs Kevin’s] application has no reasonable prospect of success because it
has already been determined that her time with [J]
needs to be supervised and
(even taken at its highest, and we are taking into account those aspects of it
that are demonstrably untrue
or misleading) it discloses no significant change
in circumstances that would justify that order being revisited. There is
no serious issue to be tried.
22 With respect to
Senior Counsel, in my view, that statement does not accurately represent the
situation. The mother’s application
was determined by default orders that
allowed other family members to accompany her during her time with J. That
might be seen to
be a way to ensure that the child might more readily enjoy his
time with the mother. Whatever the intention behind that order, the
clear. They relate to the mother’s time. The grandmother’s
application has not previously been determined
because it has not previously
been filed. I accept that if the mother filed a fresh application seeking to
change the earlier orders,
she would have significant difficulties given the
range of orders made. She would clearly have to show a significant change in
circumstances
to warrant reopening that litigation.
23 The father makes further submissions that the grandmother’s
application is mischievous, vexatious and an abuse of process.
satisfied that this is the case. I have not been taken to any previous
application by the grandmother or to the extent
of her previous involvement in
the earlier proceedings.
24 The father has also alleged breaches of the injunctions by the
grandmother in relation to giving J a drink, but the grandmother
restrained by that order – only the mother is. The only injunction
against the grandmother is paragraph 15 which is
set out above.
25 The law on summary dismissal and the
Rice & Asplund
is fairly well settled. I must take the grandmother’s evidence at its
highest in order to determine whether there
is a reasonable prospect of success.
The father clearly disputed some of the evidence of the grandmother and he may
well succeed
on these contested issues in due course. That, however, is not the
test when considering the important step of dismissing the grandmother’s
application outright and without allowing her to litigate the issue.
26 I pause to consider the earlier judgment of her Honour Sutherland M
on 18 November 2011. This judgment is described by Senior
Counsel for the
father as “very significant” as it made findings about the
grandmother. Her Honour found that the grandmother
had concealed the
mother’s drug use from the Court, misled the staff at Sir Charles Gairdner
Hospital, failed to seek medical
attention for J and failed to fulfil her duties
as a supervisor of the mother’s time. I note that this decision was an
determination.
27 Senior Counsel for the father makes the further submission [page 7, last
paragraph] that:
The orders sought by [Mrs Kevins] are extravagant and go well beyond anything
that a Court would be likely to make in respect of
a person who is not a parent
or does not have parental responsibility for a child. In that respect, and in
the context of the history
of Family Court proceedings in relation to [J], [Mrs
Kevin’s] application has no reasonable prospect of success.
28 I accept, of course, that the Court must take into account
the best interests of children in making such a determination. That
the principle of
Rice & Asplund
as it has been interpreted by other
decisions since then. I accept that there may be an impact on the father and on
the child by
having litigation in this Court once again in relation to J, but it
is not litigation between the same parties as was the case in
the proceedings
that led to the orders in 2013. It is now almost two years since those orders
were made and the application is a
very precise and particular one by the
maternal grandmother. I cannot accept that it is necessarily against J’s
best interests
to allow this application to proceed. At the end of the day,
once this matter is properly litigated, it may well be that the grandmother
not succeed on some or all of her application, but the point is that she should
be allowed to make that application and have
it determined on its merits.
29 I do not agree that the orders are extravagant or go beyond anything a
Court would likely make. In any event, that is not the
test. The test is
whether there is no reasonable likelihood of success. That prospect must not be
fanciful. The grandmother seeks
a daytime period once per month together
with a few hours on some special occasions. There is no indication that the
time is sought
to be unsupervised; that is inferred. In any event, in
circumstances where the mother only spends time with J every second Saturday
up to two hours, the proposed orders by the grandmother are not outside the
realms of a “real possibility”. In all
the circumstances therefore
I am not satisfied that the grandmother’s application should be summarily
dismissed. I do not
accept that it has “no reasonable likelihood of
30 I am therefore satisfied that the grandmother’s application should
be permitted to continue. One of the orders sought by
the father was that:
No other person other than the respondent, [Mr Hobson], be permitted to file any
further application relating to [J Hobson] without
the prior leave of the Court.
31 In my view that is not an appropriate paragraph given I am
allowing the grandmother’s application to proceed. The mother
need not be
directly involved in these proceedings as a party. She may wish to file
affidavit material in support of one or other
of the parties, but it should be
clear from my reasons above that she would be in a very difficult position to
seek to relitigate
the issues given the orders of August 2013 and my comments
above. I have made a distinction between her potential case and the
grandmother’s
32 The father also seeks various orders in relation to costs. I will
enquire as to Senior Counsel as to whether that is still sought
given these
reasons. I will also make directions about the further conduct of this
1 of the Form 1A response filed 9 January 2015 is dismissed.
I certify that the preceding [32] paragraphs are a true copy
