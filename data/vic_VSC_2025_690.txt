the conventional way and as the summons makes plain, the plaintiffs seek such
further or other order as the Court considers appropriate.
In oral argument,
counsel for the plaintiffs clarified that such an order may include, as an
alternative to the specific GCO sought
in the summons, a GCO at a rate and in a
structure that was appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in
the proceeding.
proceeding is still at a relatively early stage. Pleadings have closed,
discovery conferral orders have been made, and some production
of critical
has occurred. It is
appropriate for the Court to hear the application at this juncture.
the hearing and with the benefit of written and oral argument, I have determined
that a flat GCO rate of 30% is appropriate
and necessary to ensure that justice
is done in the proceeding. My reasons for so determining are set out in these
published reasons
and in a confidential annexure provided to the plaintiffs
contemporaneously with these published reasons.
Comprehensive Disclosure
criterion for the exercise of power on an application of this type brings into
sharp focus an unusual feature of these applications.
Much of the information
which is directly relevant to the disposition of the application is wholly or
partly confidential to the
plaintiffs and their legal advisors. Those matters
include: the legal risks of the proceeding; the recovery risks of the
proceeding;
the likely costs and duration of the proceeding; the likely
recoverable quantum; reasonable settlement ranges; alternative funding
arrangements and returns on investment. The candid and fulsome disclosure of
that information to the defendants and any other interested
parties (such as
insurers) would give rise to an obvious and undesirable forensic disadvantage
which would be contrary to the interests
of the plaintiffs and group members.
Yet the candid and fulsome disclosure of information of this type must be
provided to the Court,
to allow it to properly discharge its statutory
responsibility. The accuracy and completeness of that information may never be
tested in a contested
inter-partes
features reveal the heavy responsibility of the practitioners of the law
practice and counsel acting for the plaintiffs. As
the Court of Appeal has
observed ‘they have duties to both the court and their clients...[and] are
not in the same position
as an independent third party who purely funds the
litigation’.
The nature of a
GCO application and the corpus of confidential information required to determine
it, necessitates that all relevant
information to the disposition of the
application is proactively and fulsomely advanced. Absent that occurrence,
‘justice in
the proceeding’ is not achieved.
the context of this specific application, I was assisted by the affidavits and
submissions to which I have referred below. I also
benefitted substantially
from the supplementary affidavits and submissions filed in response to
confidential questions
which arose
as a result of my consideration of the confidential material. There is no reason
to conclude that the disclosure of the
matters relevant to the disposition of
the application has not been candid and comprehensive.
Relied Upon and Confidentiality Orders
plaintiffs rely on the following material in support of their summons:

Resources did not file submissions or seek to be heard on the application. Mr
Ellison filed brief written submissions and
neither consented to nor opposed the
plaintiffs’ application. By reference to the GCO rates awarded in other
cases, Mr Ellison’s
representatives stated that ‘it was difficult to
see why such a high rate would be justified in this case’. However,
Ellison did not elaborate upon that submission by reference to the observable
strengths or weaknesses of this case or by reference
to the specific features of
any other case.

(a) The material over which
confidentiality orders are sought reflect PFM’s frank assessments of the
risks in this proceeding
(and in other proceedings conducted by the firm), early
possible claims value estimates and methodologies, litigation budgets and
expenditure, and the matters which PFM considered and weighed up in making the
decision regarding the commencement and funding structure
proceeding.
(b) The material is either legally
privileged or commercially sensitive and has the requisite confidential
character. The disclosure
of such material would cause real and substantial
prejudice to the plaintiffs and group members in this proceeding if the
information
were disclosed to the defendants.
(c) The material would also likely prejudice the
plaintiffs and group members in other extant or future group proceedings in

views of the legal representatives, may present defendants
in those extant or
future proceedings with an unfair advantage during, among other things,
mediation discussions and trials, which
would prejudice the interests of the
plaintiffs and group members in those proceedings. In this way, the disclosure
of the information
would prejudice the proper administration of justice.
considered the unredacted versions of the materials, I am satisfied that
confidentiality orders pursuant to r 28.05(4) of the
Supreme Court (General
Civil Procedure) Rules 2025
should be made.
Legal Framework
Supreme Court Act
provides as follows:
(1) On application by the plaintiff in any group proceeding, the Court, if
satisfied that it is appropriate or necessary to ensure
that justice is done in
the proceeding, may make an order—
(a) that the legal costs payable to the law practice representing the plaintiff
and group members be calculated as a percentage
of the amount of any award or
settlement that may be recovered in the proceeding, being the percentage set out
in the order; and
(b) that liability for payment of the legal costs
must be shared among the plaintiff and all
group members.
(2) If a group costs order is made—
(a) the law practice representing the plaintiff and
group members is liable to pay any costs
payable to the defendant in the proceeding;
(b) the law practice representing the plaintiff and
group members must give any security for
the costs of the defendant in the proceeding
that the Court may order the plaintiff to give.
(3) The Court, by order during the course of the proceeding, may amend a group
costs order, including, but not limited to, amendment
of any percentage ordered
under subsection (1)(a).
(4) This section has effect despite anything to the contrary in the Legal
Profession Uniform Law (Victoria).
(5) In this section—
group costs order
means an order made under subsection (1);
legal costs
has the same meaning as in the Legal Profession
Uniform Law (Victoria).
statutory requirement for the exercise of the power to make a GCO is that Court
must be satisfied that it is appropriate or necessary
to ensure that justice is
done in the proceeding. As the Court of Appeal stated in
Bogan v The Estate
of Peter John Smedley
The court may only make a GCO if it is satisfied that it is appropriate or
necessary to ensure that justice is done in the proceeding.
It must follow that,
in regulating an aspect of the lawyer-client relationship, and the measure of
the potential return to the law
practice, the section expressly recognises that
the order may be necessary to ensure justice is done in the proceeding. It may
be inferred from the text and structure of
that a purpose of
a GCO is to put in place a funding mechanism that allows the group members to be
represented and for the matter
to proceed and that whether the proceeding
proceeds as a group proceeding may be a matter that may engage the interests of
in the proceeding. In other words,
embodies a legislative
judgment that, in some cases, it may be in the interests of justice for the
matter to be funded by the law
practice subject to the control of the court
because without such an order the matter may not be able to proceed and the
of a group proceeding to the interests of justice would be
unattainable.
applicable principles in an application of this type are now well established
and have been given extensive consideration by this
The core principles can be
summarised as follows:

Considerations
of reasonableness and proportionality inform the setting of a GCO percentage.
Determination of the reasonableness and
proportionality of a proposed GCO may be
evaluated against a number of measures including: whether it is proportional to

recovered in the proceeding; and the legal costs and disbursements
likely to be incurred in or as a consequence of the
proceeding.

The Contractual
Arrangements
plaintiffs and PFM are party to a conditional legal costs agreement dated 30
January 2025
an indemnity arrangement outlined in a letter from PFM to the plaintiffs dated
14 January 2025 (‘
Arrangement
key features of the current funding arrangement can be summarised as
there is an express agreement between the plaintiffs and PFM that a GCO will be
sought. By clause 7.2 of the CLCA, PFM is instructed
to apply for a GCO at a
percentage to be agreed between the plaintiffs and PFM.
the proceeding is presently being funded pursuant to what was described as
‘transitionary funding arrangements’.
PFM has agreed to fund the
proceeding temporarily on a “No Win, No Fee” basis, and provide an
indemnity to the plaintiff.
In particular:
4.2 of the CLCA provides that, PFM acts for the plaintiffs on a “No Win,
No Fee” basis. Under this arrangement,
PFM will charge for its work by the
application of an hourly rate, but will be entitled to recover those fees only
in the event that
the plaintiffs are successful. In that event, PFM may charge
an uplift of 25% of its professional fees carried on a “No Win,
Fee” basis. Further, the legal costs (including any uplift) can only be
recovered out of the compensation or damages received
in the event of a
successful outcome.
4.1 of the CLCA provides that the terms of the CLCA apply ‘only until the
Court makes a determination in relation to
a Group Costs Order
application’. If a GCO is made, the CLCA will continue, subject to the
terms of the GCO which will prevail
over the terms of the CLCA to the extent of
any inconsistency.
If a GCO is
not made, the CLCA will terminate within 7 days, unless PFM notifies the
plaintiffs of its intention to seek alternative
arrangements.
This is consistent
with PFM’s termination right in the event that the litigation does not
enjoy sufficient costs support.
A Flat GCO of 30% is Necessary and Appropriate
flat GCO set at a rate of 30% is appropriate and necessary to ensure that
justice is done in the proceeding. That is so for the
reasons set out in the
confidential annexure, together with the following matters.
a GCO will facilitate access to justice for group members. The plaintiffs do
not have the capacity to fund the costs of the
proceeding. I accept that PFM is
not in a position to, and is not prepared to, continue to prosecute the case on
a No Win, No Fee
basis. The only potential alternative to funding the proceeding
on a GCO basis is third party litigation funding. Where third party
funding is utilised, the combined amount of legal costs and funding commissions
deducted from group members’ awards
or settlements has historically been
higher than the GCO rate proposed by the plaintiffs (and significantly
Collens’ evidence is that:

that he is representing that there be certainty
for how the proceeding will
considers there to be an advantage in the proceeding continuing without any
delays; and,
his preference to remove the risk of the proceeding not
continuing.
a GCO in these circumstances is consistent with the legislative purpose of
Supreme Court Act
. As the Court of Appeal has
It may reasonably be inferred from the text and structure of
purpose of a GCO is to put in place a funding mechanism that allows the group
members to be represented and for the matter
to proceed and that whether the
proceeding proceeds as a group proceeding may be a matter that may engage the
interests of justice
in the proceeding. In other words,
legislative judgment that, in some cases, it may be in the interests of justice
for the matter to be funded by the law
practice subject to the control of the
court because without such an order the matter may not be able to proceed and
the benefits
of a group proceeding to the interests of justice would be
unattainable.
there is no evidence to suggest that in the seven months since the proceeding
was commenced that there is any interest from
a third-party litigation funder in
supporting or facilitating a competing class action. I am conscious of, and have
taken into account,
the prejudice that would be caused to group members by the
costs and delays of seeking alternative
In this regard, I
should add that like Waller J in
I do not accept
that recent decisions in shareholder class action litigation should lead to a
GCO being made at a higher rate on
the basis that such cases now involve greater
risk than previously thought. That is, of course, an objective assessment.
in any given case, it may be relevant to take into account any properly
proven effect of these recent decisions on the subjective
willingness of
litigation funders to fund shareholder class action litigation. Such evidence
may properly bear upon an evaluation
of whether a GCO is necessary to ensure
that justice is done in any given proceeding.
the making of a GCO will transfer the burden of meeting any adverse costs order
from the plaintiffs to PFM.
Collens’ evidence is that the plaintiffs are not prepared to shoulder the
exposure to the risk of meeting an adverse costs
order or even a part of that
risk and burden.
appropriate that the plaintiffs be provided with this degree of protection,
having regard to the magnitude of the financial
exposure, and necessary to
ensure that the plaintiffs remain in their role as representatives.
a consequence of the GCO is that it will ensure that the overwhelming majority
of any settlement or judgment sum is distributed
to the plaintiffs and group
members and is not at risk of being eroded by legal costs and funding
commissions. As has been recognised
by this Court, traditional costs calculation
methods risk eroding recoveries. The benefit of protecting against such erosion
real rather than illusory one, when the GCO is set at a level that is
reasonable and proportionate.
there are other recognised structural benefits to a GCO:
engenders simplicity and transparency from the
Under a GCO it is
simpler to explain to group members the manner in which legal costs and funding
costs are to be calculated and
and there is no need to
explain the mechanism of a common fund order. Although these inherent
characteristics of a GCO do not of
themselves establish the necessity of making
a GCO, they are relevant to the overall evaluative assessment of the
appropriateness
of the order sought, to be considered in the context of all the
other relevant
considerations.
beneficial feature of the GCO model is that it promotes the alignment of the
interests of the lawyers and the interests of the plaintiff
and group members in
maximising recoveries and conducting the proceeding
efficiently.
I am not presently satisfied that the proposed tiered or ‘ratchet’
structure is necessary and appropriate to ensure
justice is done in the
proceeding.
Determination
of the particular quantum at which a GCO should be ratcheted down is very
difficult at this stage of this proceeding.
Ratcheting invites an attempt at
precision which is not readily achievable at this juncture. In the present
case, the ratchet points
of $50,000,001 and $100,000,001 are arbitrary. The
submissions and affidavit material did not advance a basis upon which I can
quantum as being the sole driver of when a GCO rate is to be ratcheted risks
oversimplifying the multi-factorial risk-reward
calculus applicable to cases
such as this. Allowing a law practice to recover the same GCO rate at higher
quantum levels may in
fact be necessary and appropriate to ensure that justice
is done in the proceeding, having regard to,
, the length of
time the proceeding is likely to be prosecuted for and the risks attendant upon
pursuing that higher quantum. To
choose a hypothetical yet illustrative
example, the risk of pursuing claims in a narrow relevant period proximate to a
disclosure date may be far lower than the risk of pursuing those
claims in respect of alleged misrepresentations or non-disclosures
commencement of a six year limitation period. Yet, it may be that only if the
law practice takes the risk of pursuing the
broader claim, with the attendant
costs and time required, that a return for shareholders in that early part of
the relevant period
(and therefore a higher quantum) can be achieved.
ratcheting arrangement is less simple and
transparent.
object of ensuring justice is done in a proceeding is likely maximised if a law
practice’s incentive for taking risk in
pursuit of reward is wholly and
consistently aligned with the object of maximising returns for group members.
intended object of a ratchet mechanism – which is a laudable one –
is to avoid disproportion or a ‘windfall’
as the quantum of a
settlement or judgment increases. However,
provides a clear
statutory mechanism by which any disproportionate or ‘windfall’ can
be addressed if that disproportion
or ‘windfall’ actually manifests
In light of the points
already made, it is preferable that amendment power is used to address actual
disproportion at the specific
point it occurs, rather than fixing a ratchet
mechanism now.
these circumstances, a flat GCO rate is appropriate.
taking into account the facts of this case, the allegations made, the nature of
the causes of action, the specific risks
and strengths of the case, the
estimated value of the claim, and, the estimated legal costs and disbursements,

that 30% appropriately balances the risk and reward calculus
