Appeal Outcome

On 17 March 2013, Mr Dyer, ‘the Prisoner,’ and
Douglas Hunt, ‘the deceased,’ were homeless in Penrith.[2]
deceased carried his possessions in a shopping trolley, which he left in the
middle of Station Street.[3] The prisoner told the
deceased to move the trolley
and then attempted to move the trolley.[4] The deceased became aggressive
towards the prisoner by clenching
and raising his fists. The deceased told the
prisoner not to touch the trolley. Passing traffic then caused the deceased to
from the road.[4] The prisoner and the deceased resumed arguing over the
trolley and the deceased continued to move his fists in
a boxing motion towards
the prisoner. The prisoner then said to the deceased ‘if you hit me,
I’ll have to hit you.’[5]
They began pushing each other until the
deceased’s brother stepped in and separated them.[5] The deceased’s
brother then
left, thinking that the incident was resolved. The deceased then
resumed his attempt to engage the prisoner in a fight.[6]
The prisoner
then punched the deceased once with his left fist to the right side of the
deceased’s face.[6] The deceased did
not hit the prisoner at any time. The
prisoner’s punch appeared to have rendered the deceased unconscious,
causing him to fall
backwards and hit his head on the roadway.[7] The deceased
suffered significant laceration and fracture to the base of his skull.[7]
arriving at the Nepean Hospital, the deceased underwent a craniectomy and
remained in a coma until 27 March 2013.
At the time of the incident, the
prisoner was on bail from a common assault charge and an aggravated entering a
dwelling with intent
in company charge.[8] The prisoner had a number of charges
on his criminal record at the time of the incident, including numerous
assaults.[8] On 18 March 2013, the police contacted the prisoner’s parole
officer about the incident the night before.[12]
The prisoner’s parole
officer then told the prisoner to attend Penrith Police Station, where the
prisoner was arrested and
charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily
On 27 March 2013, 10 days after the incident, the deceased died
from a subdural bleed caused by the trauma to the back of his head.[7]
the death of the deceased, the prisoner was then charged with murder. However,
on 6 December 2013 the charge was the subject
of a nolle prosequi and the
prisoner was then arraigned on the current manslaughter charge. On 14 July 2014,
before the trial dated
4 August 2014, the prisoner entered a plea of
guilty.[21]

Sentencing Considerations: Comments
Relating to the Aboriginal Background of the Offender and/or Indicators of
Disadvantage
The Court accepted Dr Pulman’s evidence that the
prisoner had an ‘unfortunate childhood.’[14] The prisoner lacked
positive role models, suffered physical and emotional abuse from his mother and
her numerous partners who constantly used drugs and
he began using drugs from a
young age. The prisoner attended seven primary schools, was diagnosed with
ADHD,[15] and was repeatedly
suspended from school for fighting, eventually
getting expelled. This disadvantage led to the prisoner developing
‘anti-social
tendencies’ and ‘difficulty in managing emotion
and impulse control.’[20] The Court also accepted Dr Pulman’s
evidence that the prisoner’s ‘anti-social tendencies’
contributed to the prisoner’s violent behaviour.[20]
accepted that prolonged incarceration would exacerbate the prisoner’s
symptoms of anxiety, depression and ADHD.[20]
The Court considered the
prisoner’s repeated incarceration,[10] against his risk of being
‘institutionalised.’[25]
The Court decided that because the
prisoner’s incarceration was due to his conduct, this would be given
‘very limited
weight’ in regards to his sentence.[25] However, Dr
Pulman’s evidence, together with the prisoner’s risk of being
institutionalised, persuaded the Court to ‘give special
circumstances’ and extend the balance of term at the expense
non-parole period.[25] The Court stated that although ‘[t]here is
injustice in punishing a man for not adhering to standards
he was never properly
taught,’[26] the prisoner’s repeated incarceration should
‘have brought home to him long
before the death of the deceased, society's
inability to accept violence.’[26]
The Court considered
[2013] HCA 37[44]
when calculating whether the
prisoner’s criminal history of assaults warrants a greater need for the
community to be protected
rather than allowing for the prisoner’s
disadvantaged background as a mitigating factor in deciding his sentence.[26] In
way, the Court accepted the prisoner’s disadvantaged background as a
mitigating factor only in decreasing his non-parole period.
It seems clear that the Prisoner had an unfortunate childhood. He was one of
seven half-siblings to 6 different fathers. His mother
was a constant user of
cannabis who, according to Ms Dyer, "never showed us any affection". The
Prisoner's parents separated when
he was 3 or 4 and he has had no contact with
his father. Although the Prisoner reported having a positive relationship with
his mother's subsequent partners, in the main they seem commonly to have
assaulted her and, without opposition from her, to have
gone overboard with
punishment of the Prisoner. At one stage the Prisoner and his older sisters were
removed by DOCS.[14]
His mother frequently moved addresses and the Prisoner attended 7 primary
schools. He had learning difficulties and at age 14 was
diagnosed with ADHD for
which he took Ritalin during his school years. Psychological testing has placed
him in the borderline or
low average range in a number of areas.[15]
He was suspended from school on a number of occasions for fighting.
Ultimately it appears this suspension became permanent. He wished
to return but
his mother did nothing about it, resulting in anger and hurt and, according to
Dr Pulman, psychological distress. For
a time he worked as a carpet layer,
detailer, builder's labourer, in fibreglass engineering and with stainless steel
bench tops but
has been unemployed for approximately 13 years. He started
smoking cannabis at 14, having been introduced to it by his mother. It
him but he denies being a regular drinker or user of speed.[16]
Mr Dyer is a 29 year old aboriginal man ... He described a family history of
disadvantage and abandonment having been subjected to
physical and emotional
abuse from his mother and her numerous partners. His early experiences most
likely contributed to his current
difficulties with self-regulatory behaviour
which have been exacerbated by a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyper-Activity
His lack of solid role models and encouragement of substance abuse
within the family have only further led to the development of
anti-social
tendencies.[20]
Mr Dyer's earlier familial experiences suggest emotional and physical abuse
which can exist in both indigenous and non indigenous
families. Early family
trauma is known to contribute to difficulties in managing emotion and impulse
control and it is this environment
which has most likely contributed to Mr
Dyer's development of anti-social behaviour.[20]
Of more significance is the Prisoner's upbringing. There is injustice in
punishing a man for not adhering to standards he was never
properly taught.
However, as was pointed out
in Bugmy v The Queen
, dispositions reflecting a deprived upbringing may increase
the importance of protecting the community from an offender. Furthermore,
notwithstanding the remarks in
that experience in growing
up may compromise a person's capacity to learn, the Prisoner's school
suspensions for fighting and his
prior sentences for assault, given the remarks
that at least most of those responsible for those decisions must inevitably have
should have brought home to him long before the death of the deceased,
society's inability to accept violence.[26]
