Access to justice
Access to justice
The Access to Justice Taskforce was established in the Commonwealth
Attorney-General’s Department in January 2009 to develop
a more strategic
approach to and make recommendations on ways of improving access to justice for
all Australians. The Attorney-General
launched the Strategic Framework for
Access to Justice and released the report of the Access to Justice Taskforce on
23 September
2009. Both the framework and the report are available at
www.ag.gov.au/a2j
In October 2009 the Attorney-General’s Department held national
consultations on the taskforce’s report. This included
a number of public
seminars, a call for submissions and online feedback.
The Strategic Framework is the central recommendation of the
taskforce’s report. It comprises principles for access to justice
making and a methodology for translating the principles into practice. The
framework has at its base five principles:
• accessibility
• appropriateness
• efficiency
• effectiveness.
In November 2009 the Standing Committee of
Attorneys-General adopted the access to justice principles to guide future
decisions affecting
civil justice.
The Strategic Framework supports a justice system that does the
• promotes access to mechanisms for the early resolution of problems and
• establishes a ‘triage’ function, enabling matters to be
directed to the most suitable destination for resolution,
regardless of how
people come into contact with the system
• provides capacity for resources to be directed in such a way as to
reflect where and how people come into contact with the
justice system
• promotes social inclusion by targeting the resolution and identification
of broader concerns that might be the cause of particular
legal problems
• promotes fair outcomes
• empowers individuals to resolve disputes between themselves when
appropriate, without recourse to the institutions of the
justice system
• allocates resources more efficiently, including through ongoing
• gives every individual improved access to effective resolution
opportunities, regardless of how they come into contact with
the justice
Policy makers should apply the Strategic Framework to all
decisions affecting access to justice in the federal civil justice system.
Chapter 10 of the taskforce’s report makes recommendations specific to
administrative law, including improving the quality of
primary decision making
and developing options for more pro-active case management in the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal.
The Government is currently considering a range of measures for
implementation that support the improvement of the justice system
as a whole,
consistent with the Strategic Framework, including measure relating to
administrative law matters.
