REFEREE’S ORDER
Office of the Commissioner
Body Corporate and Community Management
[2025] QBCCMCmr 391
Mr Stephen Clarke (
The Body Corporate for Bell Park & Cambridge Management Services
respondents
Section 77(1)
Building Units and Group Titles Act 1980
APPLICATION NO:
DECISION DATE:
4 November 2025
DECISION OF:
A. Stone, Referee
CATCHWORDS:
COSTS – whether the applicant must compensate the respondents for
loss resulting from the application.
ORDERS MADE:
Within one month, the applicant must pay the Body Corporate for Bell Park
$352.50, and Cambridge Management Services $1,647.50, in
compensation for losses
resulting from the application.
REASONS FOR DECISION
24 October 2025 I dismissed the bulk of Mr Clarke’s application against
the body corporate and Cambridge Management Services
as misconceived, vexatious,
or lacking substance, and promised a further order on the question of
Both respondents had
requested compensation for their losses resulting from the application but
failed to provide evidence of the
claimed losses in their submissions. I
requested evidence of the losses and, when received, gave Mr Clarke the
opportunity to comment
on it. I will now decide whether costs are appropriate
and their amount.
Section 94C
of the Act allows a referee to order an applicant to compensate respondents for
loss resulting from an application where “an
application for an
order” is dismissed because “it appears to the referee that the
application is frivolous, vexatious,
misconceived or without substance”.
Mr Clarke suggests a costs order cannot be made in this case because I partially
in his favour, declaring on 24 October that minutes of a committee meeting
were distributed late while dismissing the other 20 orders
sought. But Members
Barlow SC and Hanly of the
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal
found with respect to the
Body Corporate and Community Management Act
’s similar costs provisions, which were brought across to the
present Act with the 2022 amendments, that a partial finding in
favour of an
applicant does not preclude a costs order being made where the bulk of the
application is dismissed because it is frivolous,
vexatious, misconceived or
without substance.
I see no reason
the same would not apply here.
[3] The body
corporate claims compensation of $352.50 for fees paid to its body corporate
manager to respond to the application.
The body corporate’s submission in
response to the application was written and submitted by the body corporate
manager, and
the body corporate manager submitted a copy of an invoice to the
body corporate in the claimed amount. That seems a modest amount
given the time
likely to be involved in reading a 562 page application, drafting and submitting
a response, and responding to my
subsequent inquiries. I have no difficulty
accepting that it would have cost the body corporate at least that much.
[4] Cambridge
Management Services engaged a lawyer to draft its submission. It submitted a
copy of an invoice issued by Chambers
Russell Lawyers for $7,700 in professional
fees to review and respond to the application.
[5] Mr Clarke
opposes the requests for costs. Some of his arguments are presented as
repudiations of the order of 24 October and
are better suited to an appeal of
that order. The present order is solely concerned with whether Mr Clarke should
pay the respondents’
costs. It is not a vehicle for amending the earlier
Clarke’s submission on costs frequently refers to case law that does not
exist, which was unhelpful.
also filled with footnote or endnote numbers that lead nowhere. There are no
footnotes or endnotes.
[7] Nevertheless,
the following relevant arguments may be gleaned from the
submission:
should not have decided whether Mr Clarke’s application was vexatious
until deciding whether to order costs.
Referee’s act of issuing letters on 22 October 2025, requesting cost
evidence from the Respondents prior to the
issuance of the final determination
on the merits, [indicates] the Referee was already satisfied that the
Applicant's primary application
would be found vexatious or misconceived before
all submissions were considered and the final determination issued.”

length of the application was necessary to address all the breaches committed by
the respondents.
should have focussed on the substance of the application when assessing whether
it was vexatious or misconceived, not the administrative
burden imposed by its
was necessary to name Cambridge Management Services as a respondent because it
is “the Contracted Agent and Executive Arm
of the Body Corporate
Committee. The application meticulously detailed that the systemic
failures—including the handling of
correspondence, distribution of
minutes, and general administrative deficiencies—were functions performed
by CMS on behalf
of the Body Corporate. The BCM is a necessary party for any
practical relief.”
should have invited Mr Clarke to add the principal body corporate as a party
rather than finding it was misconceived to seek orders
[8] In the same
not see why I was constrained from deciding whether Mr Clarke’s
application was frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or without
substance on 24
October when I decided whether to grant the orders he sought. That was the
point at which I dismissed the application
for most of the orders. Section
94C(1)(a) of the Act refers to an order to dismiss being made “for the
reason that it appears
to the referee that the application is frivolous,
vexatious, misconceived or without substance”. If that was the reason for
the dismissal, it seems proper to have explained that in the associated reasons.
Both respondents had specifically argued for a dismissal
on that basis in their
submissions and Mr Clarke had replied, so I already had the benefit of the
parties’ arguments on that
point. The only thing missing was evidence of
the claimed loss.
I wrote to the respondents seeking evidence of their losses, I had already read
the application, submissions, and reply. I was
forming the view that the
application was substantially frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or without
substance. I did not request
anything further on that point from the parties.
I only sought to establish whether the respondents had suffered a loss and its
amount, which is relevant to the present costs determination but not to the
decision of 24 October.
discussed at paragraphs 2-7 of the 24 October order, the body corporate was not
obliged to respond to Mr Clarke’s correspondence.
not persuaded of most of the alleged breaches. Much of the application was
devoted to the pursuit of orders similar to orders
Mr Clarke has unsuccessfully
sought in previous applications.
noted the length of the application at paragraph 40 only after I had already
described at paragraphs 35-39 how the application was
misconceived, possibly
vexatious, and/or lacking substance. My point was that its length
“condemned the respondents to devote
significant time and resources to
it”. The implication was that there was likely to have been costs
associated with that.
Cambridge being named as a respondent, no orders were sought against it. The
orders all sought to compel the body corporate
or principal body corporate to do
Clarke cannot make an application against the principal body
[9] I remain of
the view that Mr Clarke’s application was substantially misconceived,
vexatious, or lacking substance. It put
the respondents to the expense and
inconvenience of responding, often to arguments and allegations that have been
unsuccessfully
made to referees many times in the past. It came on the heels of
some 40 previous, largely unsuccessful applications against the
body corporate,
in addition to appeals against some of those decisions. Aspects of those prior
applications and appeals have been
described in the following
In all other respects the application is frivolous,
vexatious, misconceived and simply irrational.
Continually lodging applications seeking the same orders with absolutely no
legislative basis is an abuse of process by the
I consider the inclusion of this order and the pursuit of this appeal on this
ground to be frivolous and vexatious. Had I any discretion,
I would have awarded
costs against the appellant for his persistence in raising this ground in
disregard of previous rulings.
Both orders sought have been dismissed by referees previously and by the
appeal tribunal. There is nothing in submissions to distinguish
these findings.
The raising of these issues again is frivolous and
I have dismissed the application. There is no breach of the BUGT Act
identified by Mr Clarke or established on the material before
application is entirely without merit. Aspects of it were misconceived and
without substance.

the failings of the present application and Mr Clarke’s history of lodging
applications with similar deficiencies,
he should compensate the respondents for
their losses.
satisfied the body corporate suffered a loss of $352.50 and Cambridge Management
Services suffered a loss of $7,700. The
total amount of costs I may order under
section 94C is $2,000.
Consequently, Mr Clarke must pay the body corporate $352.50 and Cambridge
