WRITING FAMILY LAW JUDGMENTS FOR CHILDREN
This article examines the practice of Australian family law judicial officers
writing judgments for children. Just three published
judgments to date in
proceedings under pt VII of the
Family Law Act 1975
contemplated children as an audience. Informed by a children’s
rights-based approach, the article articulates the
nexus between
children’s participation in court proceedings and effective communication
of the court’s decision and reasoning.
It explains the value of, and
identifies barriers to, judicial officers writing judgments for children in
Australian family law.
Finally, the article proposes five overarching principles
that may guide the development of resources to support this judicial practice.
Amidst a climate of family law reform, this article prompts discussion about the
role of judgments for children as a strategy for
improving children’s
experiences of participation.

Children’s Right to Participation under the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child
A children’s rights-based conceptual approach to participation requires
that children participate meaningfully, safely and to
the extent that they wish
to in decision-making about matters that affect them, consistently with their
evolving capacities and with
appropriate guidance and

their views freely in all matters affecting the

12(2) requires that
the child be provided with the opportunity to be heard in
judicial and
administrative proceedings affecting them, either directly or through a
representative or an appropriate body. The UN Committee on the Rights of the
Child has identified the right to freedom of expression
(art 13) — which
includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information — and the
right to access information (art

for children to exercise their right to participation under art 12

III AN ‘INNOVATION
IN JUDICIAL WRITING’:
(ELSE) BENEFITS FROM JUDGMENTS WRITTEN FOR CHILDREN?
Without being prescriptive about the exact features of a judgment written for
children, Helen Stalford and Kathryn Hollingsworth have
sought to bring the
form, presentation and substance of judicial decisions into sharper focus in
furthering children’s access
In so doing, they have
advocated for a shift in terminology away from ‘child-friendly’
justice and
towards the need for ‘justice for children’ and, correspondingly,
‘judgments for

Commenting upon
Altobelli FM’s letter to the children in
Chief Justice of the
Family Court of Australia, Alastair Nicholson, was reported to have said:
certainly think that what [Altobelli FM has] done in terms of the letter is
quite innovative’.
Stalford and Hollingsworth have articulated the value of this judicial
practice for children themselves through ‘four potential
functions’:
‘communicative’ function helps ‘children to understand and
accept the [court’s] final
‘developmental’ function contributes to the child’s
‘development, sense of identity and legal
citizenship’;
‘instructive’ function assists children’s ‘legal
literacy’ and engagement;
and the ‘legally transformative’ function prompts more substantive
judicial engagement with children’s rights principles,
methods and values
throughout the decision-making
This article supports
Stalford and Hollingsworth’s aim ‘to serve wider calls to render
judicial decision-making more
accountable and meaningful to all those —
adults and children alike — who may be involved in legal
proceedings’.
It is argued below that the value of judgments written for children extends
the benefit to children themselves. Such judgments simultaneously
bear value for separated parents accessing the family courts to
resolve their
disputes, for judicial officers and other professionals involved in the
decision-making process and for the family
courts as an institution. The diverse
beneficiaries
of judgments for children arguably highlight the transformative potential of
this practice for promoting a family law system that recognises and respects
children’s rights and in which children feel respected
Fostering Parental
Insight and Improved Parent–Child Relationships
Children and young people who are the subject of family law proceedings
usually ‘are not there because they want to be’ but rather
because their parents are in high
This reality was
articulated in Peter Jackson J’s letter to Sam. His Honour compared the
seemingly ‘normal’ circumstance
of parents amicably making
arrangements for their children following separation with Sam’s
‘unusual’ experience:
Normally, even when parents are separated, they manage to agree on the best
arrangements for their children. If they can’t,
the court is there as a
last resort. Unfortunately, in your case, there have been court orders since you
were one year old ... What
this shows is how very difficult your parents have
found it to reach agreements. This is unusual, but it is how you have grown up.
The danger is you get used to
Many families
accessing Australia’s family courts for the resolution of their
post-separation parenting disputes have complex
needs. These families may be
affected by family violence, including physical, emotional and sexual abuse;
concerns about child safety
and neglect; and serious mental health and
substance abuse
The Australian Law Reform Commission (‘ALRC’) has observed that
‘whilst the parties to a matter before the family
courts are adversaries
by definition ... [t]he legislation requires that the children are the
“winners”’.
Within this context of complex family dynamics and needs,
judgments for children ‘can convey important messages to the adults
charged with their care’, as the following examples
illustrate.
In the letter to Sam, Peter Jackson J commented on the ‘self-centred
... behaviour’ of Sam’s father who had ‘in
some ways lost
sight of what [was] best for
His Honour implicitly cautioned Sam’s parents to enhance their focus on
their child, irrespective of their acceptance of the
orders made: ‘I hope
they have the dignity not to impose their views on you, so that you can work
things out for yourself’.
, Sheriff Anwar’s letter told the children that their
parents’ behaviour, which included saying ‘some nasty things
each other’, was ‘not right and ... not nice. It shouldn’t
happen. You should not have to hear any of that.
That is for the adults to sort
In crafting a letter to the children in
, Recorder McKendrick QC
elected to go beyond merely informing the children of what would happen to them.
His Honour pointedly chose
to tell the children that he had ‘asked ... Mum
and Dad to behave a bit better’ and ‘told [the parents] to stop
“the crap”’.
According to the child welfare officer’s report, child A had expressed
frustration at his parents’ ‘arguing and
all of [the] crap that
[was] going on’.
McKendrick QC expressly acknowledged child A’s views by stating ‘you
are right to describe it ... as “crap”’,
even though the child
had used a ‘naughty

from these choices of language and content that the judicial officer in each

to be beneficial, ‘both parents need[ed]

However, a cautionary note is warranted where a letter or judgment written
for the child(ren) extends beyond communicating the decision
by offering what
may be construed as therapeutic advice or guidance. In circumstances where the
judicial officer does not have a
therapeutic relationship with the child, and
therefore cannot know how they will respond, the principle of collaboration,
below, serves to ensure that the child’s receipt of
the judicial communication is accompanied by appropriate support from a
adult with whom the child has an established (often therapeutic)
relationship.

Challenging
Conventional Thinking about Children’s Participation
As explained in
above, the concept of children’s
‘participation’ in proceedings under
Family Law Act
has become synonymous with ‘voice’. Children’s voices are
captured by the legislative requirement to take into account
any views expressed
by the child in the assessment of the child’s best
one-directional, linear and seemingly extractive understanding of
children’s participation is reinforced by the author’s

decision-making. This research found that judicial understandings of

‘belong to the Facebook and
Twitter generation of instantaneous communication and limitless access to, and
uninhibited sharing
information’.
Lavigne [No 2]
, Judge Harland observed that ‘[t]elling children
nothing at all can increase their anxiety and sense of lack
of control’ following family law
proceedings.
Honour’s letter to the
children may be construed as an attempt to remedy children’s lack of
these circumstances, appreciating that ‘[c]hildren often feel unheard
in family law
proceedings’.
The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has explained that
children’s right to participation captures
ongoing processes, which include information-sharing and dialogue between
children and adults based on mutual respect, and in which
children can learn how
their views and those of adults are taken into account and shape the
of such processes.
Just as decision-making about families in proceedings

so too is the
right under art 12 of the
. Indeed, a child being told ‘what the
judge has decided and why’ in
proceedings determining their best interests forms a vital component of the
child’s ongoing ‘intellectual participation’
proceedings.
Bennett J appreciated that the consideration of children’s views when
determining their best interests in proceedings under
‘imposes certain responsibilities on decision makers and on
the professionals’.
Honour explained:
If the children’s views are sought before the final hearing then children
should be accorded the respect of having the outcome
notified to them in an
appropriate manner. ... Children should be accorded the respect which they will
be expected to show to others
throughout their lives. This includes taking
account of their views and opinions in a dynamic sense, not only when convenient

considerations which we are required to take into
written judicial explanation of the court’s decision and reasoning to the
child requires
adults in the decision-making process to reflect on
and how the child has participated throughout that process. Put differently,
embracing Richard Chisholm’s ‘story’ metaphor:
We must think in terms of children’s participation at various stages in
the story. At different stages, different people will
be in a position to
consider the question. Initially it will be a matter for parents and other
family members: what do we tell the
children? Once counsellors, lawyers and
others are involved, they will have an opportunity to consider the question. ...

practice of judicial officers writing judgments for children may therefore be
‘transformative’, as ‘the very
process of crafting a judgment
in a way that children can understand shines a light on the judge’s
approach to reasoning and
adjudication’ and, by extension, on the extent
to which children have participated in the decision-making process to inform
that reasoning and
adjudication.
Hollingworth has argued in the context of child protection proceedings,
communicating the court’s decision to the child

child’s entitlement to personal accountability from the writer, making the
child a participant in a conversation

particularly significant in cases where the court’s decision and orders
diverge from the child’s expressed
views and wishes, as the next
section explains.
Promoting Compliance
with Parenting Orders
The preceding two sections have articulated the value of judgments written
for children for other individuals in proceedings under
: parents, judicial officers and family law professionals involved in
the decision-making process. This section identifies a macro-level
this judicial practice for the family courts as an institution, namely, to
promote compliance with parenting orders. In
post-separation parenting disputes,
having the decision-maker clearly explain the decision and reasoning in a way
that the child
or children can understand may encourage greater
‘buy-in’, ‘acceptance’ of and ‘long-term
compliance’
The concomitant value for the family courts may be enhanced public confidence in
their decision-making
at a time when ‘[t]here is little public understanding of, or
confidence in, the current family law
Recent Australian research has identified children ‘voting with their
feet’ or resisting as a cause of non-compliance
with parenting
Rae Kaspiew et al observed that ‘limited measures’ for supporting
children’s participation in decision-making,
‘including in terms of
explaining court outcomes, [result in] orders susceptible to implementation
difficulties’.
et al concluded that compliance may be enhanced where children feel that they
have been given the opportunity to participate,
their views have been listened
to and outcomes have been explained to them in a way that they can
understand.
As one parent surveyed for that study urged:
The court MUST start listening to the child far more and at the beginning
proceedings so then agreed orders could possibly be more closely complied with.
... [G]ive the child more credit for how they feel
and what they want and treat
each child as an individual and not as a number or statistic based on their age.

orders is also reflected by 14-year-old Rani

Judicial officers may consider the practice of writing judgments for children
to sit outside of the core requirements of their role.
This view emerged in

judicial officer adamant: ‘Judges
cannot be social workers and
psychologists as well!’

STARTING THE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION CONVERSATION: GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR
JUDICIAL OFFICERS
This Part progresses from the ‘why’ of writing judgments for
children to the ‘how’. It proposes five overarching
— the ‘five Cs’ of context, content, chronology, collaboration
and closure — that may assist in
the development of guidelines or other
judicial resources to facilitate and encourage this practice in Australian
family law proceedings.
These principles have been informed by children’s
rights under the

guidelines for Australian judicial
Principle 1:
The first principle to guide judicial officers in the practice of writing
judgments for children is context: an appreciation of the
unique circumstances,
needs and experiences of the individual child. A practical challenge for
judicial officers when writing a judgment
for a child is the diversity that
exists within the umbrella term ‘children’. Perhaps the most obvious
factors impacting
accessibility are the child’s age and evolving
capacities.
intersectional nuances that judicial officers must carefully accommodate when
writing a judgment for children include
the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander
children of
culturally and linguistically diverse
backgrounds,
children with
disabilities,
children who
are transgender
and children
with histories of trauma.
A New South Wales bench book,
Equality before the Law
reminds judicial officers that
children’s ‘comprehension and communication abilities will vary
considerably, even among
children of the same age, depending on their
background, physical and mental health and
experiences’.
this diversity amongst children is framed as a ‘barrier’ to their
participation in court.
Family law judicial officers writing judgments for children must be alive to
such contextual considerations if their explanation
is to be accessible to, and
meaningfully made sense of by, the child.
For judicial officers to overlook these intersectional factors — and
indeed the fact that ‘it is the life of a
succumbing to the law’s ‘generalizing
It does so by
abstracting and obscuring the ‘intersectionalities and differences’
within the ‘group’ or ‘cohort’
of children affected by
the court’s decision.
Additionally, it risks leaning into judicial constructions of an
‘image’ of a child and an ‘ideal’ of childhood
for example, one characterised by ‘innocence, dependence, vulnerability or
danger’ — which can be ‘misleadingly
present[ed] as
universal’.
As Chisholm
has observed, ‘the great differences between individual children are
sometimes lost sight of as we try to find
patterns and guidelines for our
decisions and
Lavigne [No 2]
, Judge Harland’s letter to the children
reassured them that it was ‘alright’ that ‘[e]veryone in the
might feel differently about [the
separation]’.
Honour expressly told the children that she had considered them as individuals
with distinct feelings, views, needs and experiences
of their parents’
separation:
[I]t is most likely you will each have your own feelings about what is going on
in your family. Some of those feelings will be the
same for all of you, and some
feelings may be ones that only you have. I listened to what the experts had to
say about each one of
you, and I thought about you as individuals as well as a
group of siblings when I made my decision about your living
arrangements.
significant contextual consideration for family law judicial officers when
writing judgments for children is the potential
for the child’s expressed
views and wishes to have been coloured by parental influence. A common thread
running through the
judgments examined in this article is that the disputes

principle emerges in a context of increasing scrutiny of the ‘art and

acknowledged in
traditional reasons for judgment are not usually written with the audience of
the children in mind. The language and format of reasons
are, more often than
not, styled for an audience consisting of the parents, the lawyers involved in
the case, and an appellate
principle comprises three elements: language, format and narrative. Guidelines

Children and young people themselves have identified two key features of a
‘child-friendly’ document: first, language
and terminology that they
can understand and that is easy to follow (‘condensing key information

Simple words.
Short sentences. Definitions of things that might be hard to
understand’);
secondly, a design and presentation of content that is accessible and

Principle 5:
According to Chisholm, the
legislative framework for determining
post-separation parenting disputes ‘does not fit the reality very
well’, for it
‘presupposes a set of procedures directed towards and
culminating in the trial, a single period of oral evidence and argument
by a judgment; end of
For children,
however, the ‘reality’ is that a family court judgment is but a
of their story of change and adjustment following their
parents’ separation: ‘the trial will be an important episode,

One justification
for this practice is to
ensure that the child understands that a court’s lack of adherence to
views and wishes is not simply caused by their status as a
justification, which has significant implications for the child’s
future (including their wellbeing and capacity for resilience
following their
experience of
parental separation), is that the child’s ability to gain a sense of
closure should
be supported.

attempt to create a meaningful ‘feedback loop’ with the judicial
officer, albeit through a third party, was underpinned
by a concern to
facilitate a degree of acceptance of, and closure from, the court’s
decision. Indeed, the precis for the young
person concluded with a message of
hope that the court chapter of her ‘story’ was now complete:
All the people involved in helping your family at Court really hope that Court

life, a wonderful future and
to get on with being a teenager, while knowing that a final decision has been
made. Even though you
may not like some of the things said in this letter, the

wish to engage at all with the judicial officer who has written to them. Yet by
equipping the child with information
to form a view about the outcome and an
avenue through which to express that view to the decision-maker, the

in the court proceedings concludes, thereby allowing
the child to take a crucial step towards closure.
VI CONCLUSION
This article has advocated for the practice of family law judicial officers
writing judgments for children in proceedings under
. The principles developed — the ‘five Cs’ of context,
content, chronology, collaboration and closure — intend
to inform and
support the effective judicial communication of family court decisions to
children. Collectively, these principles
serve as a ‘gateway’ to
improving children’s access to justice, by enabling them to understand the
decision and
The focus is
timely, given the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child announcement that its
General Comment on children’s right to access justice and
effective remedies will address ‘the procedural right[s] of
children such
as ... the right to be fully informed throughout the entire procedure ...
including information on their rights and
decisions that could affect
timely given the publication of
Writing to Children
by the President of
the Family Division of the High Court of England and Wales, Sir Andrew
McFarlane, in February
Developed with the Family Justice Young People’s Board, that publication
serves as guidance for judges on when, how and why
to write to children in
family court proceedings, and it does so as a ‘first step’ to
‘promote discussion and support
practice development’ and to
encourage judicial learning.
Two limitations of writing judgments for children must be acknowledged. The
first is that the practice may not be in a child’s
best interests in every
case. The principles presented in this article may assist in determining the
threshold question of whether
a judicial officer
write a judgment
for the child or children in proceedings under
. The second limitation concerns the role of judgments for children in
the process of children’s participation. Without children’s
meaningful participation in proceedings, judgments seemingly written
‘for’ them may evoke understandable scepticism that
attempts to reflect children’s lived experiences, views and wishes in the
judgment are disingenuous, ‘inauthentic’
‘tokenistic’.
task of effective judicial communication must be ‘more than a superficial
exercise in rebranding’ or simplifying
language and judgment
Indeed, when
participation is understood as ‘a fluid process, rather than a singular
event’, the task requires genuine
engagement with children and their views
stages of the judicial decision-making process; this engagement
will be reflected in the judgment as the final product of that
Notwithstanding the policy emphasis on children’s participatory rights
in Australian family law, this article has not been so
ambitious as to propose
that the practice of writing judgments for children should be translated into a
legislative
obligation.
Yet by challenging ‘conventional thinking about children’s
participation’,
hoped that this article may encourage judicial officers to attempt this
‘innovation in judicial writing’ in proceedings

See above Part II(A).
Relevantly, there are obligations to communicate court outcomes and reasons in
state and territory child protection
and youth justice legislation: see, eg,
Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998
NSW Children Act
Children (Criminal
Proceedings) Act 1987
Care and Protection of Children
Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act
Children, Youth and Families Act 2005
Vic Children Act
Children and
Community Services Act 2004
s 10(1)(e).
Two especially illustrative
examples are
s 10(1)(e) of the
NSW Children Act
), which requires the Secretary of the
Department of Communities and Justice, defined in s 3 (definitions of
‘Secretary’
and ‘Department’), to provide the child or
young person with ‘information about the outcome of any decision
the child or young person and a full explanation of the reasons for
the decision’, and
s 527(1) of the
Vic Children Act
), which requires the court to explain
the meaning and effect of any order made ‘as plainly and simply as
possible and in a
way which it considers the child ... will understand’.
However, research into children’s participation in multiple jurisdictions
in Australia has exposed a disjunct between law and policy on the one hand and
practice on the other: see Cashmore, Kong and McLaine
(n 20) 3, discussing
NSW Children Act
); Briony Horsfall,
‘Children’s Participation Rights during Child Protection
Proceedings: Recognition, Legal Representation,
and the Redistribution of Care
in Victoria’s Children’s Court’ (PhD Thesis, Swinburne
University of Technology,
January 2016) 257–8, discussing
Vic Children
); Patrick Parkinson,
‘The Child Participation Principle in Child Protection Law in New South
Wales’ (2001) 9(3)
International Journal of Children’s Rights
259, discussing
NSW Children Act
). In Cashmore, Kong and McLaine (n 20)
it is specifically argued that ‘in practice, it is very unclear how well
these provisions
are met and how well they result in children being heard and
their views considered’: at 3, discussing
NSW Children Act
) [86] (Altobelli FM).
