Application for approval of the L.A.N.E.C. Services Pty. Limited and ETU
Electrical Contracting Enterprise Agreement 2025-2029
L.A.N.E.C. Services Pty. Limited has made an application for approval
of an enterprise agreement known as the
L.A.N.E.C. Services Pty. Limited and
ETU Electrical Contracting Enterprise Agreement 2025-2029
(the Agreement)
pursuant to s 185 of the
Fair Work Act 2009
(the Act). The Agreement is a
single enterprise agreement.
The National Electrical and Communications Association (NECA) has
made an application on behalf of the employer under s 218A to vary
the Agreement
in order to correct what are said to be three obvious errors. The
Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information,
Postal, Plumbing
and Allied Services Union of Australia (CEPU) supports the application and
agrees that the Agreement contains the
three errors identified in the
application and that they should be corrected in the manner proposed. The
following corrections are
sought. First, Part A clause 10.7(a)(ii) would be
varied to remove the words ‘at the rate of time and a half for the first
two hours and double time thereafter’ and to replace them with the words
‘at the rate of double time’. Secondly,
Part A clause 33.3(e) would
be varied so that the number ‘2’ is moved below the line that
appears in the formula, such
that it is a divisor in respect of ‘EW8
weekly all purpose rate + EW9 weekly all purpose rate’. Thirdly, Part A
34.1(a) would be varied to replace ‘clause 32’ with
‘clause 33’.
In light of the explanations in the s 218A application (form F1), I
accept that the Agreement contains obvious errors and that it
is appropriate to
correct them in the manner proposed. The copy of the Agreement published with
this decision reflects the three
variations referred to above. The variation
will operate from the date of this decision.
On the basis of the material contained in the application and
accompanying declaration, I am satisfied that each of the requirements
186, 187 and 188 as are relevant to this application for approval has been
The CEPU, being a bargaining representative for the Agreement, has
given notice under s 183 of the Act that it wants the Agreement
to cover it. As
required by s 201(2), I note that the Agreement covers the CEPU.
The Agreement was approved on 12 November 2025.
