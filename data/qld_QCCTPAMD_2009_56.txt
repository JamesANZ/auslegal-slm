REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application for extension of time for the brining of a claim against the
section 470
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
applicant commenced proceedings by completing the necessary form 50 on 23 June
2009, and filing it in the Tribunal shortly after.
17 August 2009 the Chief Executive sent advice to the applicant that the claim
was out of time, and advised him of his right to
bring the present application
for extension of time. He did so by means of a document filed on 10 September
applicant attempted to serve the necessary documents on the respondents by
forwarding them to the liquidator of Vehicle Solutions
Pty Ltd (in liquidation).
This was good service so far as the respondent company in liquidation is
concerned. However the liquidator
advised that:
Despite many attempts I have not been able to get any
information from the company director, Mr Randall Hughes, regarding this matter.
I have also forwarded the notices and documentation sent from your office to Mr
Hughes but it has been returned to my office unclaimed
(copy of letter
attached). At this stage I have not been able to ascertain another forwarding
address for Mr Hughes.
the only “respondent” to have been served is the company in
liquidation.
the liquidation of a company stands in the way of further prosecution of legal
proceedings (section 471B of the
Corporations Act (Commonwealth) 2001
unless the permission of a superior court is first obtained. However that is
not the case in proceeding of the present kind which
is a claim against a fund,
and not against the company in liquidation. The legal basis for this conclusion
is contained in
Thomson v Autogroup Cleveland Pty Ltd and others
CCT 23 March 2009. In short, the statutory basis of such a claim is “a
claim against the fund” (section 470)
which must be made to the chief
executive (section 473). Is it the chief executive who is required to give
notice of the claim to
the persons whose actions are alleged to have given rise
to the claim (section 474).
am satisfied that it is not necessary for the present applicant to seek or
obtain leave to proceed in the present matter because
an applicant has no claim
against the company in liquidation, even though form 50 requires the company to
be designated a “respondent”.
The form cannot override the statutory
basis of the claim.
submissions were made by the liquidator on behalf of the respondent company.
Background facts
September 2007 the applicant had dealings with Mr Hughes and Vehicle Solutions
Pty Ltd with a view to purchasing a motor vehicle.
A cheque for $2,630.00 was
handed to Mr Hughes, the director of Vehicle Solutions Pty Ltd for the deposit
on the purchase of a car.
It was not put into trust, and indeed seems to have
been fraudulently converted. By 6 December 2007 it was clear to Dr Ladewig
applicant’s Director) that the cheque had been misapplied and a demand was
made for its return.
applicant had no success in its pursuit of its money, and obtained no response
to its demands. The respondent company convened
a meeting and passed a special
resolution on 2 August 2008 to go into liquidation. I infer that the applicants
did not know about
this. Indeed, as late as 8 June 2009 Dr Ladewig prepared a
creditor’s statutory demand for payment of the debt and attempted
it on the company without realising the company was already in liquidation.
realising this, he quickly made the present claim on the fund, his formal claim
being received on 24 June 2009.
applicant became aware that it had suffered financial loss because of the
relevant events on 16 November 2007. Section 472 of
PAMDA requires such a claim
to be made within one year after the person becomes aware of the relevant loss.
It follows that the
present claim was approximately 7 months late.
question is whether this is an appropriate case to extend time for the making of
the claim. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to
do so under section 511 of PAMDA
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
(“the CCT Act”).
claim is a relatively small one and it may well be that the applicant is
persisting with it because of understandable outrage
at the dishonesty of the
respondent motor dealer.
delay not a lengthy one and does not seem to have disadvantaged the chief
executive or the respondents. For example it is difficult
to see how any
opportunity for the Chief Executive to obtain recourse against these defendants
has been impaired in any way by the
delay. The circumstances reveal a typical
commercial disappearance by an unsuccessful entity.
face the applicant has a case for a valid claim against the fund. The reason
for the delay has not been well explained, but
the applicant states that
“all means of redress against the trader have now been
exhausted”.
things considered I think it appropriate that time be extended in this
particular matter.
precise date when the claim or Form 50 was received by the department does not
appear from the file, but the latest date stamp
is 29 June 2009. I shall
therefore extend the time for commencement of the proceedings to that date.
application for extension of time within which to make a claim is extended to 29
