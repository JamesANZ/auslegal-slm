Findings of fact on issues under investigation
& reasoning
Threatening and inappropriate statements
the letter of demand, under the heading ‘Misleading and deceptive
conduct’, the Respondent Lawyer stated the following:
August 2017, you have been
on several occasions of failing to
deposit funds received by the Business Partnership into the Business Bank
Account and instead depositing
those monies into your personal bank
(emphasis added)
having knowledge your financial position, you failed to disclose it to our
client and wilfully [sic] requested and
induced our client to loan monies to the
Business Partnership on the basis that it would be repaid in accordance with the
Partnership
Agreement. A representation as to future matters such as the
operation of the company may also be misleading and deceptive in the
circumstances that you do not have reasonable grounds making such
representation, particularly with regarding to repayment of a
reason of the above,
you have engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct
under section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law, and our client seeks to recover
damages for her loss arising directly as a result of your conduct pursuant to
section 236 of the Australian Consumer Law
the heading ‘Criminal matters’, the Respondent Lawyer stated as
“Since August 2017, you have been guilty on a number of occasions of
failing to deposit funds received by the Business Partnership
into the Business
Bank Account and instead depositing those monies into your personal bank
account, with the intention to permanently
deprive both the Business Partnership
and our client – the rightful owners of those monies – of assets
belonging to them.”
consideration of the above and circumstances surrounding your misleading and
deceptive conduct, we note that
you are in breach of Sections 81 and
Crimes Act 1958
(Vic) for Obtaining Property by Deception and Obtaining a
Financial Advantage by Deception, each of which exposes individuals to
of up to 10 years imprisonment, if found guilty
conduct is indicative of obtaining money by deception by virtue of the above.
This is a criminal offence and carries with it serious penalties
(emphasis added)
“Accordingly
in the event the payments described above are not made to our client within the
time lines set out in this letter
, we have been instructed to take action to
seek orders that you provide all financial and other documents relating to the
Partnership and any personal and business related bookkeeping and
financial records and receipts for consideration as to
whether we should act
on our instructions to report you for obtaining property and a financial
advantage by deception
extensive review of the Respondent Lawyer’s file in relation to which the
alleged conduct related demonstrated that there
was no evidence of the
Respondent Lawyer providing advice to the client as to the following, therefore
enabling her to provide informed
instructions:
the Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’) could apply to the partnership
dispute matter with the complainant;
the conduct outlined in the letter of demand could likely amount to misleading
and deceptive conduct;
process of conducting proceedings under the ACL, including the agencies that can
enforce the ACL;
damages she was likely to recover if court proceedings were commenced or the
matter was referred to the relevant agency with respect
to the ACL;
nature of the litigation process and the likely period it would take; and
possible risks and consequences of embarking upon litigation.
response to the allegation regarding threatening and inappropriate statements,
the Respondent Lawyer submitted that:
“had very little to do with dealing with ‘smaller’
counterparties or clients”
a softer, more amenable and conciliatory tone was in
acknowledged
“might have been over zealous with [his] choice of language,
tone and approach”
was acting on clear and express instructions from the client, including
instructions to
“bankrupt him”
if the debt was not
that the client was the victim and needed
“robust representation”
“clearly” c
ould not have been his intention to threaten
criminal proceedings since the institution of criminal proceedings are a matter
relevant authorities;
was of the view that his instructions demonstrated that the complainant had
breached provisions of the
Crimes Act 1958
acknowledged
that he did not discuss the ACL with the client but that he had received
instructions that the complainant’s conduct
was misleading and
reference to the ACL was a mistake as he acknowledged it did not apply to
individuals in partnership;
had closely based the letter of demand on a precedent provided to him; and
did not intend upon misleading or deceiving the
client’s instructions cannot override a lawyer’s obligations under
the Uniform Law, the
Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian
Solicitors’ Conduct Rules
2015 (‘Uniform Rules’) and their
other professional obligations.
Respondent Lawyer’s intention is not a relevant factor in assessing
whether the statements in the letter of demand misled
or intimidated the
complainant.
his complaint, the complainant stated that he felt that the letter of demand,
particularly in context of the threat of criminal
charges, was very threatening
and he felt increasingly threatened by the client’s demands and then
receipt of the Respondent
Lawyer’s letter. Following receipt of the letter
of demand, the complainant engaged a lawyer to provide him advice regarding
content of the letter of demand and to act on his behalf regarding a response to
the Respondent Lawyer. Further, the complainant
has submitted that he thought
the Respondent Lawyer and/or the client would execute criminal proceedings.
is not for the client or the Respondent Lawyer to determine whether the
complainant is ‘guilty’ of various offences
‘breached’ various sections of the
as acknowledged by the Respondent Lawyer, the ACL does not apply to individuals
in partnership. In any event, it is not for
the client or the Respondent Lawyer
to make a finding that the complainant has engaged in misleading and deceptive
conduct under
of the ACL.
Additionally,
a review of the Respondent Lawyer’s file does not support the conclusions
reached and statements made in the letter
of demand regarding breaches of the
and that the complainant had engaged in fraud and/or misleading and
deceptive conduct.
in circumstances where ‘bankruptcy proceedings’ can only be
commenced where a final judgment or order has been handed
down with respect to
the debt, threatening to commence such proceedings in the letter of demand,
being the first letter to an alleged
debtor prior to the initiation of court
proceedings, is capable of inducing the debtor to believe that should the debt
costs) remain unpaid, he may be declared
Legal costs
the letter of demand, the Respondent Lawyer sought the payment of legal costs in
the following terms:
“unless payment of eleven thousand,
six hundred and ninety-two dollars ($11,692.00) and
our costs of $1,500
is received by our client by way of cleared funds..., we will act on our
instructions to
commence bankruptcy proceedings
without further
amount of one thousand, six hundred and seventy dollars and thirty cents
($1670.30) must be paid into the following account on
or before 5:00pm on
Friday, 5 January 2018 ... (the Kershaw Account)
amount of eleven thousand, five hundred and twenty-one dollars and seventy cents
($11,521.70) must be paid into the Kershaw Account
to be clear,
our instructions are to initiate bankruptcy proceedings in the
event any of the payments noted above are not effected in accordance
above conditions. We will also be seeking further costs and an award of interest
in the event those amounts are not paid
as instructed
letter of demand specifically refers to “our costs”, is on the
letterhead of [Company Name ] and is signed by the
Respondent Lawyer in his role
as Principal of [Company Name].
respect to the concern that the letter of demand sought payment of legal costs,
the Respondent Lawyer submitted in the first
response that:
assisted the client on a pro bono basis and that the costs referred to in the
letter of demand were your client’s
“additional costs in
connection with the matter”
“never issued [Complainant Name] with a bill or invoice”
“acknowledge[d] that the recovery of costs is one reserved for the
courts or the agreement of the parties. I should have made
it abundantly clear
that any costs, interest or the like could only be raised as part of actual
court proceedings (if any), but again,
I can confirm that I was not seeking any
costs relating to my fees, as I was not charging, and have never charged my
client, any
fees or costs.”
review of the materials provided by the Respondent Lawyer demonstrates that the
client submitted that she instructed the Respondent
the monies owed by [Complainant Name] to me in addition to further costs I had
expensed in needing to deal with this
the further response, the Respondent Lawyer outlined that the Letter of Demand
was closely based on a precedent provided by a colleague,
including the demand
for legal costs, and was the first and only demand letter the Respondent Lawyer
had prepared and sent.
Respondent Lawyer further acknowledged that when sending the letter of demand he
the request for payment of legal costs was
inappropriate and never intended to mislead or deceive”
accordingly, that the request was a mistake.
the Respondent Lawyer submitted that given his inexperience in the area, he
intended upon referring the management of the
debt collection matter to another
law firm (‘referred law firm’). The Respondent Lawyer expressed that
the sum of $1,500.00
was an estimate of the legal costs to be charged by the
referred law firm.
light of the Respondent Lawyer’s responses and a review of the law
practice’s file, it is clear that the Respondent
Lawyer failed to ensure
that the client had a legal entitlement to claim costs on top of the alleged
debt amount.
is no evidence in this matter that a contractual right exists between the client
and the complainant. In the further response,
the Respondent Lawyer has
acknowledged that
“legal costs were not payable and should not have
been included in the letter of demand.”
overall impression of the letter of demand was to purport that legal costs were
recoverable. That allegation is incorrect as pre-litigation
costs were not
recoverable.
the letter of demand firstly seeks payment of $11,692.00 and costs of $1,500.00,
which amounts to $13,192.00 (‘the
total sum’). The letter of demand
then seeks payment of the total sum by way of a payment of $1,670.30 by 5
January 2018 and
five payments of $2,304.34 on five consecutive dates.
Accordingly, it is apparent that there is a lack of distinction in the letter
demand between the debt itself, which was arguably claimable, and the legal
costs, which were not.
have given consideration to the overall impression of the letter of demand. On
the basis of the evidence before me, and the matters
set out above, I find the
following proved:
letter of demand creates a false impression that the client was legally entitled
to $1,500.00 in legal costs;
letter of demand creates a false impression that failure to pay the total
result in the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings;
result in further costs and an award of interest;
1. the complainant being ordered to
“provide all financial and other documents relating to the Business
Partnership and any personal and business related bookkeeping
and financial
records and receipts”
2. the Respondent Lawyer reporting the complainant for obtaining property
and a financial advantage by deception in circumstances
where the Respondent
Lawyer had already stated that the complainant was in breach of
sections 81
for Obtaining Property by Deception and Obtaining a
Financial Advantage by Deception and that such conduct could result in 10 years
imprisonment;
complainant was misled and/or intimidated by the statements, referred to above,
in the letter of demand; and
letter of demand threatens the institution of criminal proceedings, with respect
to breaches of
sections 81
for Obtaining Property by
Deception and Obtaining a Financial Advantage by Deception, against the
complainant if a civil liability
to the client (being the payment of the total
sum) was not satisfied.
Relevant law
complaint was received on 8 January 2018, at which time the Uniform Law was in
Uniform Rules apply to the conduct subject of the findings of fact as the
conduct occurred after 1 July 2017.
34.1 of the Uniform Rules provides that:
A solicitor must not in any
action or communication associated with representing a client:
34.1.1 make any statement which grossly exceeds the legitimate assertion of
the rights or entitlements of the solicitor’s client,
and which misleads
or intimidates the other person,
34.1.2 threaten the institution of criminal or disciplinary proceedings
against the other person if a civil liability to the solicitor’s
not satisfied,
296 of the Uniform Law prescribes that unsatisfactory professional conduct
includes the conduct of a lawyer occurring in connection
with the practice of
law that falls short of the standard of competence and diligence that a member
of the public is entitled to
expect of a reasonably competent lawyer.
section 298(b) of the Uniform Law provides that unsatisfactory professional
conduct includes conduct consisting of a contravention
of the Uniform
Characterisation of the conduct
reason of the above findings of fact, I find that the Respondent Lawyer
statements in the letter of demand which grossly exceeded the legitimate
assertion of the rights or entitlements of the client,
and which misled and/or
intimidated the complainant; and
the institution of criminal proceedings against the complainant if a civil
liability to the client was not satisfied.
am therefore satisfied that the respondent lawyer engaged in unsatisfactory
professional conduct within the meaning of section 296
of the Uniform Law.
conduct amounts to a contravention of rule 34.1.1 and 34.1.2 of the Uniform
Rules constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct
pursuant to section
298(a) of the Uniform Law.
have considered analogous previous decisions of this office and of VCAT. Of the
decisions considered, some conduct involving letters
which included statements
which were calculated to mislead or deceive the debtor and which grossly
exceeded the legitimate assertion
of the rights or entitlements of the
lawyer’s client have been characterised as professional misconduct. Those
decisions, however,
involved systemic conduct involving thousands to tens of
thousands of demand letters being sent per month, where the lawyer practised
primarily or solely in relation to debt recovery matters and/or amounted to
breaches of the rules which applied prior to 1 July 2015,
Professional Conduct and Practice Rules
have accepted the Respondent Lawyer’s submissions that:
letter of demand was the first letter of its nature he had sent; and
usually does not act in matters in relation to debt
Determination & reasons
considered all of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I determine
that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the order detailed above.
deterrence is a relevant factor in this matter as it is important that the legal
profession is reminded that it is improper
to send correspondence
threatening:
institution of legal proceedings if legal costs are not paid in circumstances
where a contractual right does not exist; and
institution of criminal proceedings if a civil liability is not
this matter I have taken into account the following mitigating factors, the
Respondent Lawyer has:
record of previous substantiated complaints;
co-operated
with this office during the course of the investigation, providing his answers
in a timely manner and, if unable to provide
the answers as and when required,
has been in contact with this office;
familiarised

Traps for Lawyers’ as well as the Uniform
to the complainant by way of a letter dated 10 September
to Section 314 of the Uniform Law, a respondent lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may,
in accordance with the applicable
legislation appeal to VCAT, or seek a review by VCAT, of this determination made
under section
299 of the Uniform Law.
Non-compliance
failure to comply with a determination made under section 299 is capable of
constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or
