September 2024, the tenants requested to keep a 13-week-old Staffordshire Bull
Terrier cross Mastiff puppy named [redacted] (the
requested pet), at the
premises, following the process established in the Residential Tenancies Act
1987 (RTA).

Under the RTA, tenants have the right to
keep a pet at their rental premises with the landlord’s approval.
The tenant is responsible for any damage or nuisance caused by a pet
they keep at the premises.
Landlords have the right to apply to Consumer
Protection for an order allowing them to set certain conditions on the approval
pet request.
The landlord is responsible for demonstrating that the
conditions are reasonable.
When an application is received, the
Commissioner is required to, either:
approve the
landlord’s application; or
landlord’s application.
Reasons for Decision
a delegate of the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the evidence
relevant to deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for
When deciding whether to approve a condition, I am guided by
the following factors:
Is the requested
condition appropriate, reasonable, and proportionate to the risk?
Is the requested
condition covered under any other law?
Do the parties
agree to the requested condition?
requested condition address any of the following factors in the RTA:
premises are unsuitable for keeping the pet;
the pet at the premises would exceed a reasonable number of pets being kept at
the premises;
the pet at the premises is likely to cause damage to the premises that could not
be repaired for less than the amount of the
security bond for the premises;
the pet at the premises would pose an unacceptable risk to the health and safety
of a person;
the pet at the premises is likely to cause the lessor undue hardship; or
prescribed ground.
Requested condition – The
requested pet is only permitted to be housed outside in the rear and front yard
The landlords are concerned the requested pet could damage the
floorboards and carpets inside the property.
Photos provided by the
landlords show the main living area and hallway have wooden flooring. The
landlords are concerned that the
security bond would not be sufficient to cover
costs to repair the flooring, should it be damaged by the requested pet. The
provided a quote from [redacted], confirming it will cost $2,728 to
sand and seal all wooden flooring, maintain areas where needed,
and clean up the
site. This quote assumes the requested pet will cause damage to the entire
internal wooden flooring throughout the
premises, or that damage in one part
would require all wooden flooring to be subject to the same treatment.
There is no evidence before me to suggest the requested pet is likely to
cause damage, either to the entire floor or to a part of
the floor. No evidence
has been provided about the cost of replacing the carpets at the premises.
The landlords provided images of the yard to demonstrate the suitability
of this area for the requested pet. The photos show a large,
grassed area and
covered patio area.
The tenants advised Consumer Protection that one
person will usually be at home with the requested pet, and when this is not the
the requested pet would be put in the cat enclosure in the rear yard. The
tenants advised that it is unlikely the requested pet would
be unsupervised
inside the house, and this will limit any potential damage caused by the
requested pet. The tenants have also advised
that the requested pet’s
nails would be clipped regularly, further reducing the risk of damage.
The tenants provided a screenshot of messages between themselves and
[redacted] about the care of the requested pet. [redacted] advised
that due to
the requested pet being a puppy, it must be kept inside during the evenings
while the weather is cooler.
After considering the information provided
by both the landlords and the tenants, I am not satisfied that the landlords
have demonstrated
why the condition is necessary. Therefore, the condition
requested by the landlord is not approved.
A tenant or
landlord who is dissatisfied with this decision can appeal to the Magistrates
Court of Western Australia. Appeals must
be lodged within seven days after
receiving this decision, or a later date if leave is granted by the Court.
The appeal can be started by lodging both a Form 1B – Appeal
Against Registrar’s Decision and a copy of this notice with
Magistrates Court online at ecourts.justice.wa.gov.au/eCourtsPortal.
