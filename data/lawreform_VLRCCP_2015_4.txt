Who should decide what happens to a person’s body when they die? A
survey conducted by an Australian charity found that 51 per
cent of respondents
wanted to plan their own funeral. Those respondents may be surprised to learn
that in Victoria the funeral and
burial instructions of a deceased person are
not binding on the person who is legally authorised to arrange their funeral and
The Victorian Law Reform Commission is examining the law that gives primacy
to the wishes of the executor or likely administrator
of a deceased
person’s estate over those of the deceased. This review forms part of the
Commission’s community law reform
program, which enables members of the
community to contribute their ideas on how to improve Victorian law. Under the
Victorian Law Reform Commission Act 2000
, the Commission may initiate
inquiries into legal issues of general community concern, and which are of
relatively limited size and
The Victorian Law Reform Commission adopted this project after a community
member wrote to the Commission because she believed the
current law was in need
of review. She explained that a close family member had recently died and that
the woman’s wishes
regarding the disposal of her body had not been adhered
to by the executors of her estate. The community member said that the impact
her family had been devastating.
The law regarding funeral and burial instructions emerged in 19th century
England when the law assumed that people wished to have
a Christian burial, and
when cremation was disapproved. Twenty-first century Australia is a vastly
different society from 19th century
England. Many people reject religion or have
no religious belief. There are diverse cultural and religious practices and
family arrangements. Substantial importance is placed upon individual
autonomy, and people may reasonably expect their funeral and
burial arrangements
to reflect their personal values and choices.
The death of a person is a distressing time. Funeral and burial disputes have
significant potential to cause additional and long-lasting
harm to individuals,
families and even whole communities. The question for Victorians is whether the
current law reflects society’s
values and, if not, what legal regime
should take its place.
I warmly encourage anyone with an interest in the issues discussed in this
paper to make a written submission to the Commission by
21 December 2015.

Terms of reference
[Matter initiated by the Commission pursuant to section 5(1)(b) of the
Victorian Law Reform
Commission Act 2000
(Vic) on 25 June 2015.]
At common law, the executor or, where there is no executor, the person with
the highest claim to administer a deceased person’s
estate, has the right
to arrange for the final disposal of the deceased person’s body. The
executor or likely administrator’s
wishes regarding the final disposal are
given primacy over the wishes of all others, including the deceased.
The Victorian Law Reform Commission will consider whether the law should be
amended to enable a person to leave binding instructions
place of the final disposal of their body, and any associated rituals. These
instructions are known as funeral
and burial instructions.
In conducting this review, the Commission will have regard to:
• whether legislation recognising funeral and burial instructions is
• the different cultural and spiritual beliefs of Victorians relating
to the final disposal of bodies
• recent legal developments in domestic and international common law
Administrator
A person appointed by the court under letters of administration to
administer a deceased estate that has no executor. This
may be because there is no will, the will does not appoint an executor, or
a named executor is unwilling or unable to act.
Administrator hierarchy
The order of priority given to claims to the administration of the estate
of the deceased. The hierarchy is governed by the common
law in some states
(including Victoria) and legislation in others.
Where the deceased has left a will, an executor may be appointed under that
will to administer the estate of the deceased.
Executor rule
The executor of an estate has the right to dispose of the deceased
person’s body.
Final disposal
This includes burial and cremation, as well as any other lawful means of
disposing of a dead body. Final disposal takes place after
medical intervention
and does not include tissue donation.
Funeral and burial instructions
Instructions regarding the place and method of the final disposal of a dead
body, and any associated rituals.
Letters of administration
A grant of letters of administration may be made where there
is no will, or where there is a will but no executor is available. It
confers upon a court-appointed administrator the authority
to administer the
Likely administrator rule
Where there is no executor and no administrator of a deceased estate, the
person most likely to be appointed the administrator of
the deceased estate has
the right to dispose of the deceased person’s body.

6 Structure of this paper
1. Introduction
1.1 In 1863, explorers Robert O’Hara Burke and William John Wills were
given Victoria’s first state funeral in recognition
of their bravery and
service to country.1 Following the retrieval of their bodies from Cooper’s
Creek, they lay in state in
Melbourne for two weeks, where
100,000 visitors came to view the bodies.2 On the day of their funeral,
politicians, defence force personnel, police officers and
clergy accompanied
their mahogany coffins through spectator-lined streets to the sound of the Dead
March.3 Following a religious
service and the firing of minute guns, Burke and
Wills were buried in a vault in Melbourne General Cemetery.4
1.2 Two years later, David Young was the first person to be hanged at Old
Castlemaine Gaol, having earlier been convicted of the murder
of a 17-year-old
housewife in Daylesford.5
Like many prisoners hanged at Old Castlemaine Gaol, it appears that his body
was buried upright in unconsecrated ground facing the
external wall of the
prison.6 If an application by locals to have him exonerated is successful, they
plan to have his body dug up
and laid to rest in consecrated ground, over 150
years after his death.7
1.3 As these stories illustrate, funeral and burial practices are about the
living as well as the dead.8 While they honour (or dishonour,
as was the case
for David Young) the life of the deceased, they also allow survivors to
reinforce their relationship to the deceased
and begin the process of moving
forward after the death, and allow the community to support survivors through
that process.
1.4 However, the views of survivors concerning how a body should be
farewelled might differ from those of the deceased, or from those
survivors.9 If an elderly woman tells her family that she wishes to be cremated
but one of her sons objects because it
is contrary to his religious beliefs, what should happen to the woman’s
body upon her death? Or if an Aboriginal man dies, and
his birth family want him
buried on country while his non-Aboriginal wife wants him buried in their local
cemetery so she can visit
his grave, where should he be buried?

8 Unless the context indicates otherwise, throughout this paper the term
‘burial’ includes burial and cremation.
9 Unless the context indicates otherwise, throughout this paper references to
the disposal of a dead body include the disposal of
well as human remains.
1.5 While many funeral and burial disputes are resolved peacefully, others
cause lasting harm to individuals, families and, occasionally,
communities. According to the law, the wishes of the deceased person’s
executor or, where there is no will, the wishes
of the person most likely to
administer the deceased person’s estate,10 are to be given primacy over
the wishes of all others,
including the deceased.11 In practice, particularly
persuasive family members often have the final say.
1.6 The question put to the Victorian Law Reform Commission by a community
member, and the question the Commission is now asking Victorians,
is: Should the
law allow people
to leave funeral and burial instructions that are binding upon those who
survive them, thereby allowing individuals to determine what
happens to their
body when they die?
1.7 Few people appear to know who has the right to decide what happens to
their body when they die. Those who have chosen their lawyer
or accountant as
the executor of their will might be surprised to know that their lawyer or
accountant has the right to control the
disposal of their body upon their
1.8 The law regarding this matter first emerged in 19th century England. In
the leading case of
in 1884, Mr Justice Stephen stated,
‘The law presumes that everyone
will wish that the bodies of those in whom he was interested in their
lifetime should have
Christian burial’.12
1.9 In the 19th century in England, cremation was widely thought to be
illegal. In
, the court held that cremation was lawful as long
as it was not done in such a way as
to amount to a public nuisance.13 However, cremation continued to be
regarded with suspicion by many and was rarely practised.14
In 1886, the Holy
Office of the Catholic Church in Rome banned Roman Catholics from practising or
supporting cremation, condemning
it as a pagan practice that was carried out by
people of doubtful faith.15
1.10 Thus in England in the 19th century, there was relatively little need
for people to leave binding funeral and burial instructions.
1.11 The social context in which the law on funeral and burial instructions
is now applied in Australia is vastly different. Blended
families16 and
cross-cultural relationships are much more prevalent, and individual autonomy is
much more valued, than was the case
in England 130 years ago. A corresponding
diversity of desire now exists about how a person’s body should be
disposed of when
1.12 Given these developments, the Commission is seeking the views of the
community on whether the law on funeral and burial instructions
aligns with
their values and expectations and, if not, what legal regime should take its
Origin of the project
1.13 As well as investigating matters given to it by the Attorney-General,
the Commission initiates its own investigations into ‘relatively
legal issues that are of general community concern’.17 ‘Relatively
minor’ means limited in size and scope.
It does not mean that the subject
matter of the inquiry is insignificant. The Commission refers to these inquiries
as community law
reform projects and it asks community members and groups to
propose topics of inquiry.
10 The person most likely to administer the deceased person’s estate is
usually the deceased’s partner, followed by the
deceased’s children,
parents etc.

16 A blended family is a ‘family formed from the members of separate
families, usually as a result of the parents’ remarriage’:
(Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, 6th ed, 2013) 153.
Victorian Law Reform Commission Act 2000
1.14 The topic of funeral and burial instructions was put to the Commission
by a community member. A recently deceased member of her
family had told various
people that she wanted to be cremated and have her ashes scattered in a place
that was meaningful to her.
However, the deceased’s executors, who were
also related to the deceased, chose not to adhere to the deceased’s
as was their right under the law. This caused significant distress to
the community member and the Commission was told that the impact
on her family
had been devastating.18
1.15 After conducting a preliminary investigation into funeral and burial
instructions, the Commission concluded that a review of
the law in this area
could be of significant personal and public benefit.
Scope of the problem
1.16 More than 35,000 people die each year in Victoria.19 Most often,
hospitals and nursing homes remove a person’s body within
hours of their
death and, within a day or two, survivors organise to have the body transferred
to a funeral provider in preparation
for the funeral and burial, which is
undertaken shortly after.20 If a person dies at home, someone must call a doctor
to organise
a death certificate and, assuming they do not have to
report the death to the police or coroner,21 arrange to have the body
transferred directly to the funeral provider.22
1.17 At this time of immense grief, and sometimes shock, survivors often have
to make decisions quickly about how and where their
family member or friend
should be laid to rest. These decisions impact on the memory of the deceased,
the feelings of family and
friends and, to varying degrees, the feelings of the
broader community. Some may also believe that these decisions impact on the
capacity of the deceased to transition into the afterlife.23
1.18 It is unsurprising, then, that differences of opinion frequently arise
in relation to where and how a person should be buried.
When that difference of
opinion turns into a dispute that cannot be resolved by the people involved, or
when those involved feel
that they were forced to accept an outcome that was
contrary to their wishes or those of the deceased, there can be ongoing trauma
1.19 The Commission is aware of 47 funeral and burial disputes that have come
before the courts in Australia over the past 30 years,
with seven of them in
Victoria.24 Many more disputes have taken place outside the courts.25
1.20 A review of the cases indicates that disputes are particularly prevalent
where there is ongoing conflict within the family, parents
have separated and
re-partnered, or family members have different cultural and religious beliefs.26
Just under half of the cases
involved Aboriginal deceased.27

causing unnecessary distress

Previous reviews by law reform commissions
1.24 Reviews by other law reform commissions have been of great assistance to
the Commission in its preliminary investigation into
this issue. The law reform
commissions of Ontario, Western Australia, Queensland and New Zealand have all
previously asked whether
the views of the deceased regarding their funeral and
burial arrangements should be binding on those who dispose of the

respects, the law reform commissions of Ontario, Western Australia
Queensland all recommended that the
law allow people to leave legally binding funeral and burial instructions.37

its inquiry, its final
report is not yet publicly available.

1.26 The Commission would like to hear the views of the community on the
questions raised throughout this paper. A complete list of
questions can be
found on page 62. While you are welcome to share any views or experiences you
wish in relation to the topic under
consideration, the Commission will limit the
scope of its inquiry to the terms of reference on page vii.
1.27 The Commission will not review the law relating to tissue (including
organ) donation, as it falls outside the scope of the terms
of reference. The
terms of reference specifically refer to a person’s instructions regarding
disposal of their body, which takes place
after any medical intervention.

Structure of this paper
1.30 This paper is divided into nine chapters.
1.31 Chapter 1 introduces the topic and includes information on how to
participate in the
Commission’s inquiry.
1.32 Chapter 2 briefly outlines the requirements for lawfully disposing of a
body in Victoria.
1.33 Chapter 3 sets out the common law on funeral and burial instructions in
Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand and the United
States of America.

9 Conclusion
2. Lawful methods of disposal
Introduction
2.1 This chapter sets out the lawful methods of disposal of bodies available
in Victoria.
2.2 The requirements for lawfully disposing of a body are largely set out in
Cemeteries and Crematoria Act 2003
(Vic) (the Act). While burying or
cremating a body in a public cemetery are the two most common forms of disposal,
the law makes provision
for other methods of disposal as long as permission has
been obtained from the relevant office holder/s.
2.3 Under the Act, a person must not bury a body in a place other than a
public cemetery unless they have obtained the permission
of the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services.1 The Secretary may attach conditions
to the approval, including
in relation to the depth of the burial.2
2.4 Before burying a body in a public cemetery, a person must apply to the
cemetery trust for approval to bury the body there.3
2.5 If a person wishes to cremate a body, they must do so in a public
cemetery, unless permission is obtained from the Secretary of
the Department of
Health and Human Services to cremate the body elsewhere.4
2.6 Before cremating a body in a public cemetery, a person must apply to the
cemetery trust for permission to cremate the body there.5
Cemeteries and Crematoria Act 2003
The disposal of ashes
2.7 The Act states that there is no requirement to dispose of cremated human
remains in a public cemetery.6
2.8 Local council and other public bodies have varying requirements
concerning the disposal of ashes, with some having no formal or
policy. For example, scattering ashes in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne
is strictly prohibited,7 but Hobsons Bay
City Council expressly permits the
scattering of ashes on land owned or managed by council.8
A person may thus need to obtain permission from a public body if they wish
to scatter ashes on public land or, in the case of private
land, from the
2.9 As discussed in more detail in Chapter 3, at common law a person cannot
own a dead body. However, a person can own ashes.
Doodeward v Spence
, the High Court held that the human body
can constitute property ‘when a person has by the lawful exercise of work
so dealt with a human body ... that it has acquired some attributes
differentiating it from a mere corpse awaiting burial’.9
Applying the
‘work and skill exception’ established in
Doodeward v
Justice Byrne in
Leeburn v Derndorfer
stated that:
the application of fire to the cremated body is to be seen as the application
to it of work or skill which has transformed it from
flesh and blood to ashes,
from corruptible material to material which is less so.10
2.11 Justice Byrne then held that a person’s right to own ashes
is subject to the qualification that ‘arises from
the fact that the ashes
are, after all, the remains of a human being and for that reason they should be
treated with appropriate
respect and reverence’.11
Other methods of disposing of bodies
2.12 The burial of bodies at sea is allowed if a permit has been obtained
from the Federal Minister for the Environment.12 To obtain
a permit, it is
usually necessary to show that the deceased had a special connection to the sea,
as may be the case for navy personnel
or fishermen.13
2.13 This chapter sets out the legislative requirements for disposing of a
dead body in Victoria.
In most cases there is a choice of two options: burial or cremation. However,
those making the funeral and burial arrangements are
often required to make
decisions about other aspects of the funeral such as prayers, rituals, the
location of the ceremony and other
practices. As with the choice of burial or
cremation, disagreements may arise
among survivors about who should make these decisions, and the deceased may
have left instructions which may lead to conflict. The
next chapter considers
the common law in relation to funeral and burial instructions.

20 Conclusion
3. Funeral and burial instructions in the
Introduction
3.1 The position of Australian courts in relation to funeral and burial
instructions is well settled—a person’s wishes
with respect to the
disposal of their body are not legally binding.1 The person with the right to
dispose of the body may do so in
any manner they choose, provided it is not
unlawful,2 unreasonable3 or exercised in a way that prevents family and
friends from
reasonably and appropriately expressing affection for the
3.2 However, in a small number of cases, a person’s wishes regarding
the disposal of their body have been taken into account
by Australian courts
when deciding who should have the right to dispose of the body, effectively
ensuring the deceased’s wishes
were carried out.
3.3 Canadian and English courts follow a similar approach to Australian
courts. In contrast, New Zealand courts require the person
with the right to
dispose of the body to
take into account the views of the deceased, the views of family members and
the deceased’s cultural or religious background
before making appropriate
funeral and burial arrangements.5 Courts in the United States have taken
another approach altogether,
upholding the primacy of the wishes of the deceased
against all others.6
3.4 This chapter reviews the common law in Australia and other
Funeral and burial instructions
3.5 A person has no right to control the final disposal of their body, other
than by choosing an executor who then has, subject to
limited exceptions, an
absolute right to decide how the body shall be disposed of.7 The reason for
this is that there is no property
in a dead body (the ‘no property’
rule).8 As Justice Kay held in
Williams v Williams
, ‘If there be
no property in a dead body it is impossible that by will or any other instrument
the body can be disposed of’.9

Selecting the right holder
Executor rule
3.6 Where the deceased has named an executor in their will, the executor has
the right to dispose of the body.10 In most cases, this
arrangement is not
challenged and the courts do not become involved. Where the executor is not
ready, willing or able to arrange
for the final disposal, the court may decline
to grant the right of disposal to the executor named
in the will.11 The court may also decline to make such a grant where there
is ‘real doubt’
Likely administrator rule
3.7 Where the deceased has not left a will, the right of disposal goes to the
administrator of the deceased’s estate.13 As
it is rare for an
administrator to be chosen prior to the disposal of the deceased, the court will
grant the right of disposal to
the person most likely to
be awarded the right to administer the estate.14 The administrator, and
hence the likely administrator, may be passed over if they
are of bad character
or otherwise unfit to act.15
3.8 In Victoria and Western Australia, the order of priority for
administration is governed by common law.16 In all other states
territories, the order is governed by statute.17 At common law, the order of
priority is:
• spouse of the deceased18
• children of the deceased19 or, if the children are not yet 18 years
old, the children’s guardian20
• adoptive parents of the deceased21
• biological parents of the deceased22
• foster parents of the deceased23
• extended family of the deceased24
• householder of the premises in which the deceased passed away.25
3.9 Where two people have an equal claim to administer an estate, such as two
parents of the deceased, the courts must consider the
‘practicalities of
burial without unreasonable delay’.26 This is so that a prompt burial
takes place,27 and family and
friends of the deceased have the opportunity to
attend the funeral.28

Other material factors
3.10 More recently, the likely administrator rule has been described as
‘the usual approach’,29
‘not an inflexible rule’,30 and ‘a sensible, practical
prima facie
test’.31 This has allowed the courts to consider other
material factors when deciding who has the right to dispose of a body.
Cultural factors
3.11 In the South Australian case of
Jones v Dodd
, the court
determined that the deceased’s father had the right to dispose of the
deceased, and not the likely administrator,
who was the mother of the
deceased’s minor children.32 Despite conflicting evidence as to whether
the deceased had abandoned
his Aboriginal cultural beliefs and converted to
Christianity,33 the court released the body to the father of the deceased in
with Aboriginal tradition.34 Justice Perry, with whom Justices
Millhouse and Nyland agreed, said:
In my opinion, proper respect and decency compel the courts to have some
regard to what Martin J [in
Calma v Sesar
] refers to as ‘spiritual
or cultural values’, even if the evidence as to the relevance of such
considerations in a particular
case may be conflicting.35
3.12 In the Victorian case of
Dow v Hoskins
, Justice Cummins held that
the court may consider cultural factors where they ‘substantially arise on
the evidence before the
3.13 Although the deceased in
Jones v Dodd
Dow v Hoskins
died without an estate and therefore it was unlikely that an application for
administration would be made,37 it has since been held
in the Victorian case of
Keller v Keller
, where there was an estate, that cultural and religious
factors should be considered where ‘the attitude of the deceased to
issues is not substantially in dispute’.38
3.14 In contrast, in New South Wales, Justice Harrison was of the view that
although culture was relevant, taking it into account
when determining who
should have the right to dispose of the body ‘impermissibly enlarge[s] the
range of potential considerations
beyond matters of practicality, particularly
in circumstances where the merits are otherwise evenly balanced’.39
Wishes of the deceased
3.15 There have been a few cases in which the wishes of the deceased have
been considered when determining who should hold the right
of disposal.40 In
one of these cases, the wishes of the deceased regarding the disposal of their
body played an important role
in the court’s decision to award the right of disposal to someone other
than the likely administrator.41

court should ‘have regard to the practical circumstances ... and the need
to have regard to the sensitivity of the feelings

religious, cultural or

3.16 The deceased in the Queensland case of
Frith v Schubert
Aboriginal man who had been adopted.42 As the adoption had not been formalised,
the family with whom
he had spent most of his life had no claim to administer the estate. The
adoptive brother and current partner of the deceased successfully
applied for a
limited grant of letters of administration in order to bury his body.43 The
deceased’s ex de facto spouse, who
was the mother of his children, applied
to the court to have the order set aside so that she could bury the deceased in
plot in accordance with Aboriginal tradition. The applicant was
supported by the deceased’s biological father.
3.17 Although the statutory administrator hierarchy favoured the ex de facto
spouse as the mother of the deceased’s minor children,
Justice Lyons
decided in favour of the adoptive brother. In doing so, he gave substantial
weight to the fact that the deceased had
told his adoptive brother on a number
of occasions that he wished to be buried next to
his adoptive parents.44 In determining the deceased’s wishes in the
face of conflicting evidence, Justice Lyons also considered
lifestyle and
relationship factors, such as the deceased’s close relationship with his
adoptive family, his plans to purchase
property near his adoptive family and the
fact that he had had little contact with his biological family.45
Nature of the right
3.18 The right holder has the right to dispose of the body and the
accompanying right to possess the body for the purpose of disposal.46
holder has sole discretion as
to how the body may be disposed of, subject to the requirements that they not
exercise their discretion unlawfully,47 unreasonably48
or in a way that would

Robinson v Pine Grove Memorial Park Ltd
, Chief Judge Waddell
confirmed that ‘an executor has a right to possession of the ashes of a
deceased who has been cremated
to direct how they shall finally be disposed
of’, noting that this was particularly the case where the executor intends
act in accordance with the wishes of the deceased.50
3.20 As stated in Chapter 2, the right to possess the ashes is a proprietary
one, subject
only to the qualification that the ashes should be treated with appropriate
respect and reverence.51

de facto spouse is someone who at the time of the deceased’s death had
been the deceased’s partner for a continuous
period of at least two years

until his death in October 2010 and, hence, was not yet his

(the seminal English case discussed at [3.26] – [3.28]) before finding
that the deceased’s executor had the right to bury
the body, and that the
executor did not have to adhere to the wishes of the deceased in relation to the
location of the disposal.53
Hunter v Hunter,
the deceased, who was a Protestant, had
expressed a wish to be buried next to his wife, a Roman Catholic, who had not
yet died. Shortly
before his death, he was baptised by a Roman Catholic priest
and received into the Roman Catholic Church. Upon his death, the
son, who was the executor of the deceased’s will,
successfully applied to the court to stop his mother burying his father in
Catholic cemetery where she would later be buried.54 Instead the deceased was
buried in a Protestant cemetery, in accordance with
3.24 More recently, in
Saleh v Reichert
, Justice Bell considered the
executor rule in the context of a deceased Muslim woman who had asked to be
cremated when she died.
Her husband, who had been appointed administrator of her
estate, wanted to carry out her wishes. However, her father opposed her
cremation, as it was contrary to the Muslim faith.56
3.25 Justice Bell found in favour of the husband. As the administrator he had
the duty to dispose of her body and the right to determine
the method of
disposal, provided that the remains were disposed of in a ‘decent and
dignified fashion’.57 Justice Bell
concluded that:
[T]he expressed wishes of a person as to the disposition of his or her body
cannot be enforced in law. Nevertheless, there is nothing
to prevent an executor
or administrator, on whom the duty falls to dispose of the remains, from
carrying out the deceased’s
lawful wishes concerning the disposal of his
or her body.58
3.26 The seminal English case, upon which the common law in Australia, Canada
Zealand also rests, is
Williams v Williams
3.27 The deceased in
Williams v Williams
had instructed his
executors in his will to give his body to his friend so that she could dispose
of him in accordance with a private
letter he had given her, and to reimburse
her for the costs of his disposal. The letter asked
that his friend cremate his body, although it was unclear whether cremation
was legal in England at the time. As the deceased’s
wife and son had
instead chosen to bury him in unconsecrated ground in their local cemetery, his
friend had the body exhumed under
the pretext of moving it to consecrated
ground, before taking it to Italy to have it cremated
in accordance with Italian law. When the friend asked to be reimbursed for
her expenses, the executors refused.60

3.28 In finding in favour of the executors, Justice Kay held that ‘It
is quite clearly the law of this country that there can
be no property in the
dead body of a human being’.61 It follows that a person cannot leave
binding instructions regarding the
disposal of their body.62
While it also follows that an executor does not own the body they are obliged
to dispose of, they nonetheless have the right to possess
the body until it is
properly buried.63
3.29 The relevance of the deceased’s wishes in determining who should
be awarded the right to dispose of their body was recently
considered in
Borrows v HM Coroner for Preston.
Following the suicide of a 15-year-old boy, the boy’s mother sought to
have him buried alongside other members of her family,
notwithstanding the fact
that he had asked to be cremated. His uncle, with whom he had lived for the last
eight years of his life,
wanted to have the boy cremated in accordance with the
boy’s wishes.65
3.30 While the hierarchy of administrators favoured the boy’s mother
over the boy’s uncle,66
Supreme Court Act 1981
(UK) empowered the High Court to appoint an
administrator other than in accordance with the hierarchy if it was necessary or
by reason of special circumstances.67 In finding in favour of the
boy’s uncle, Justice Cranston identified
a number of special circumstances, including that the mother’s
long-term heroin addiction rendered her incapable of handling
funeral arrangements, and that the mother continually expressed a desire to bury
her son in a manner that was contrary
to his wishes.68
3.31 On the relevance of the deceased’s wishes, Justice Cranston
One thing is clear, that in as much as our domestic law says that the views
of a deceased person can be ignored it is no longer good
law ... It is quite
clear from the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that the
views of a deceased person as to
funeral arrangements and the disposal of his or
her body must be taken into account ... [I]n this type of case a person’s
can be regarded as a special circumstance ...69
New Zealand
3.32 The right to dispose of a body and the wishes of the deceased in
relation to their disposal were recently considered by New Zealand’s
highest court in
Takamore v Clarke
3.33 Upon the death of a man of Maori descent, his partner of 20 years, who
was not Maori, decided to bury his body in a cemetery
close to her and their
children. The deceased’s birth family objected, wanting the body buried in
their homeland, next to the
deceased’s father and ancestors. While
discussions with the deceased’s partner about the place
of burial were ongoing, the deceased’s birth family took the body and
buried it in accordance with their wishes.
3.34 The deceased’s partner applied for an order to exhume the body
arguing that, as the executor of the deceased’s will,
she had the right to
dispose of his body. The deceased’s sister, mother and brother argued that
as the deceased was Maori,
Maori customary law should apply in place of the
common law.71

3.35 All five judges of the Supreme Court held that the deceased’s
partner had the right to dispose of the body, but for different
reasons. The
majority (Justices McGrath, Tipping and Blanchard) found that the executor and
likely administrator rules exist in New
Zealand72 and that they come into
effect when nothing is done to dispose of a body or when a dispute arises.73
3.36 When deciding how to dispose of a body, the person with the right to
it should consider the views of the deceased, the views of family members and
the deceased’s cultural or religious background.74
The right holder does
not have to seek out this information but should consider it where it is made
known to them.75 The right
holder may also have regard to the practicalities of achieving burial or
cremation without undue delay.76
3.37 The judges observed that this approach ‘allows a range of values
to be weighed without presuming, in advance, which cultural
position will
prevail, while also ensuring that decision making will be expeditious for
reasons of public health and decency’.77
3.38 The majority rejected the argument that the court should not interfere
with the right holder’s discretion unless exercised
improperly,
capriciously or wholly unreasonably,78 instead finding that an aggrieved party
may ask the court to review the appropriateness
of the right holder’s
decision.79 Where this happens, the court must:
address the relevant viewpoints and circumstances and decide, making its own
assessment and exercising its own judgment, whether an
applicant has established
that the decision was not appropriate.80
3.39 In her minority judgment, Chief Justice Elias found that the executor
rule does not apply in New Zealand81 and that previous
judgments to the contrary
were out of step with modern expectations concerning human rights, the
importance of cultural values and
the public interest.82 After observing that
granting a right to dispose of a body to a primary decision maker is
inconsistent with
the ‘no property’ rule,83 Chief Justice Elias
stated that the responsibility of burial is a shared responsibility that
be exercised by close family members in accordance with the circumstances.84
Where there is a dispute, the
parties should ask the court to decide who should have the right to dispose
of the body.85
3.40 On the relevance of the deceased’s funeral and burial wishes,
Chief Justice Elias stated:
In modern conditions I think it is also unacceptable to say that the views of
the deceased are views that can be ignored. Human rights
are engaged because the
disposal of
human remains touches on matters of human identity, dignity, family, religion
and culture. Disempowerment in decisions of great personal
moment may be as
emotionally distressing as an outcome that is contrary to religious or cultural

3.41 In his minority judgment, Justice William Young also rejected the
application of the executor rule in New Zealand, stating that
its foundations
were flimsy and that there was little logic to it.87 In relation to the latter
argument, he expressed the view that
an executor’s financial obligation to
pay for the deceased’s burial (assuming the estate
has sufficient funds) does ‘not provide a cogent basis for an executor
to have a right to possession of the body against [the
widow or other] close
relatives who are also prepared to bury the deceased in an appropriate
3.42 However, if it could be demonstrated that the executor had been chosen
by the deceased in order to carry out their funeral and
burial wishes, that
would ‘be of considerable and probably decisive significance’.89
3.43 Justice William Young also rejected the likely administrator rule,
stating that the administrator hierarchy had been created
with the proper
distribution of a deceased’s estate in mind, and that its application to
burial disputes was inappropriate.90
According to Justice William Young,
‘common sense suggests that a dispute as to burial should be addressed
directly on its
United States of America
3.44 Courts in the United States have established a common law right for a
person to be disposed of in accordance with their wishes.
Instructions expressed in a will
3.45 Where the wishes of the deceased are contained in a will, the
courts will uphold the primacy of the wishes of the deceased
against all others,
unless there is a compelling reason not to.92
Re Eichner’s Estate,
the court held that: ‘The
authorities are clear ... that the wishes of a decedent in respect of the
disposition of his remains
are paramount to all other considerations’.93
Kasmer v Guardianship of Limner
, for example, the court ordered the
executor of the deceased to cremate him in accordance with his wishes, despite
the executor’s
religious objections to cremation.94
3.47 However, the courts have declined to uphold the deceased person’s
testamentary instructions regarding the disposal of their
body where the
evidence indicated that the deceased person had changed their mind since
creating the will, and where performance
of the wishes had become impossible.95
When ordering the deceased’s executor to carry out the deceased’s
cremated in
Re Johnston’s Estate
, the court observed
that the deceased’s instructions were reasonable, practical and capable of
performance,96 thereby creating
room for the argument that instructions that do
not meet those criteria may not have to be carried out.

Instructions not expressed in a will
3.48 Where the deceased expressed their wishes orally or in a document other
than a will, the courts will often but not always uphold
the deceased’s
wishes. Such disputes must be decided on a case-by-case basis having regard to
competing interests.97 In
Re Henderson’s Estate
the court held
[A]lthough such a dispute is of a nature that no hard and fast rule may be
applied alike to all cases, and that consequently the court’s
should be controlled by the inherent equities of the particular case, having due
regard to the interests of the public,
the wishes of the deceased and the
feelings of those entitled to be heard by reason of relationship or association,
nevertheless
... if considerations of propriety and decency do intervene, the
[court] ... should give heed to the wishes of the deceased if they
ascertained.98
Selecting the right holder
3.49 The person with the duty to dispose of a body is the same as the person
most entitled to inherit the estate of a deceased who
died intestate, meaning
that the duty falls upon the spouse, followed by the children, followed by the
parents, etc.99 This is so
regardless of whether the deceased dies with or
without a will. However, where a person with the duty to dispose of the body
to do so in a manner that is contrary to the wishes of the deceased,
the courts will award custody of the body to those who will
give effect to the
deceased’s wishes.100
3.50 As this indicates, the executor rule does not exist in the United
Wales v Wales,
the court stated that the views of the executor
regarding the deceased’s disposal carry little weight as ‘there is
necessary identity between the office and family ties’.101 In his
summary of the law of dead bodies in the United States,
Percival E Jackson
observed that the duty to dispose of the body, the privilege of possessing the
body, and the duty to pay for
disposal are separate interests which may vest in
different people.102
3.51 A review of the common law in Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand
and the United
States reveals three different approaches to a person’s funeral and
burial instructions.
3.52 The first approach, advanced in the common law of Australia, Canada and
England, allows a person with the right to dispose of
a body to do so as they
wish, regardless of the deceased person’s instructions.
3.53 The second approach requires the person with the right to dispose of the
make an appropriate decision about the method and place of disposal after
taking into account the deceased’s wishes, the views
of family members and
the deceased’s cultural or religious background. They may also take into
account the need to dispose
of the deceased without undue delay. This approach
is found in New Zealand.
3.54 The third approach, adopted by courts in the United States, is that the
funeral and burial instructions must be carried out unless there is a
compelling reason not to do so.

Funeral and burial
instructions in legislation
22 Introduction
22 Australia
23 United States of America
24 Conclusion
4. Funeral and burial instructions in legislation
Introduction
4.1 This chapter reviews the statutory treatment of funeral and burial
instructions in Australia and other countries.
4.2 With the exception of Tasmania and Victoria, every Australian state and
territory upholds people’s wishes to be cremated
and/or their wishes not
to be cremated in certain circumstances. Victoria only recognises the wishes of
people not to be cremated
when a magistrate or coroner orders the disposal of
the body of a person with limited resources.
4.3 In some jurisdictions in Canada and the United States, legislation
imposes on the person with the right to dispose of a body an
obligation to
adhere to the funeral and burial instructions of the deceased. Legislative
regimes allowing a person to bestow upon
an agent the right to dispose of their
body have also been established in the United States.
4.4 Neither England nor New Zealand has enacted legislation recognising the
wishes of the deceased in relation to the final disposal
of their body.
4.5 Most Australian states and territories recognise the deceased’s
wishes to be cremated and/or the deceased’s wishes
not to be cremated in
certain circumstances.
Wishes to cremate
4.6 In New South Wales and Queensland, when the deceased has expressed a
desire to be cremated in written instructions the law prohibits
the cremation
being carried out other than in accordance with those instructions.1 In Western
Australia, when the deceased has expressed
a desire to be cremated in written
instructions, legislation obliges the administrator of the deceased’s
estate to use all
reasonable endeavours to carry out the deceased’s wishes
regarding their cremation.2
4.7 In the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Western
Australia, when a personal representative or next of kin objects
cremation of the deceased, legislation awards primacy to the wishes of the
deceased where the deceased has left signed or
attested written instructions
expressing a desire to be cremated.3
4.8 There is no legislation in Victoria recognising a person’s wish to
be cremated.
Public Health Regulations 2012
(NSW) reg 77(2);
Cremations Act
– (2). The Queensland Act specifically overrides
the common law to the extent that it allows a person to direct their
representative
to cremate their body and, in doing so, qualifies the
representative’s right to decide how to dispose of the body: s 7(3).
Cremation Act 1929
Cemeteries Act
(NT) s 18 (2);
Burial and Cremation Act
Cremation Act 1929
Wishes not to cremate
4.9 In the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Western
Australia, if a deceased leaves instructions expressing a desire
cremated, it is unlawful to cremate the body contrary to those
instructions.4
4.10 In Victoria, similar legislation that generally recognised a
person’s instructions not to cremate was repealed.5 However,
continues to recognise the wishes of people with limited resources in relation
to cremation when a magistrate or coroner
is making an order for the disposal
of their bodies. When a magistrate or coroner makes an order requiring a
cemetery to dispose
of a person’s body free of charge, the magistrate or
coroner must direct the cemetery to cremate the body unless cremation
contrary to the wishes or religion of the deceased.6
4.11 Legislation in British Columbia and Quebec creates an obligation on the
person who disposes of a body to carry out the deceased’s
funeral and
burial instructions.7
Funeral and burial instructions
4.12 In British Columbia, the
Cremation, Interment and Funeral Services
Act, SBC 2004
provides that the deceased’s written preference
regarding their disposal is binding on the relevant person within the statutory
hierarchy if the preference is stated in a will or funeral services contract and
compliance ‘would not be unreasonable or impracticable
hardship’.8
Civil Code of Quebec
states that ‘a person of full age
may determine the nature of his funeral and the disposal of his body’ and
that a minor
may do so with the consent of their parent or guardian.9
Quebec’s courts have found that instructions left in accordance with
statute may be written or oral.10
United States of America
4.14 Numerous legislative regimes exist across the United States allowing
people to leave funeral and burial instructions that are
binding on the person
with the right to dispose of their body and/or to appoint a funeral and burial
agent with the right to dispose
of their body.11
Funeral and burial instructions and/or agent
4.15 A number of statutes establish a hierarchy of people authorised to
control the disposal of human remains. An agent appointed
by the deceased for
that purpose is at the apex, followed by the deceased’s spouse, then the
deceased’s children, and
so on. Instructions left by the deceased
regarding their funeral or burial are binding on the person with the right to
control their
disposal.12

4.16 The form instructions must take differs from state to state. With one
exception, all states require written instructions and,
of those states, most
have specific requirements about the kind of document the instructions must be
contained in.13 In Montana,
can leave oral instructions if they record them, and two adult witnesses
attest to the recording’s accuracy in writing.14
4.17 The nature of the obligation to adhere to the deceased’s
instructions also differs from state to state. In Texas, the person
right to dispose of the body must only adhere to instructions to the extent that
they or the estate can afford to do so.15
In Minnesota,
the instructions must also be reasonable and lawful.16
4.18 In Delaware, the right holder only has to adhere to instructions that
are ‘reasonable under the circumstances’.17
Among the factors the
right holder may take into account when deciding whether the instructions are
reasonable under the circumstances
are the size of the deceased’s estate,
cultural or family customs and the deceased’s religious or spiritual
4.19 Three statutory approaches to funeral and burial instructions can be
found in Australia, Canada and the United States.
4.20 The first approach allows people to leave binding instructions in
relation to cremation
only. This approach has been adopted to varying degrees in most jurisdictions
of Australia. In Victoria, it only applies to a very
small class of people, and
then only in relation to instructions not to cremate.
4.21 The second approach, implemented in two Canadian provinces, allows
people to leave funeral and burial instructions that are binding
on the person
who disposes of the body.
4.22 In addition to allowing people to leave binding funeral and burial
instructions, the third approach, found in the United States,
allows people to
appoint an agent to control the disposal of their body. Where the person has
left instructions, the agent must follow
those instructions. Otherwise the agent
may dispose of the body as they wish.
13 In New Jersey, instructions must be in a will: NJ Stat Ann §
45:27-22(a) (2015). In Alabama, instructions must be in an affidavit
substantially the same form as the statutory form and signed by a notary
Ala Code § 34-13-11(b
) (2015). In Iowa, a written declaration must be
in substantially the same form as the statutory form and must be contained in or
attached to a durable power of attorney for health care. This must be signed and
dated in front of two witnesses or a notary public.
If the declaration is
witnessed, neither of the witnesses may be the representative named to handle
the funeral arrangements: Iowa
Code § 144C.6 (2014).

5. Reasons for reform
Introduction
5.1 This chapter highlights the problems with the law on funeral and burial
instructions in
Lack of community awareness
5.2 Few Victorians know who has the right to dispose of their body or are
aware that any funeral and burial instructions they leave
in their will or
elsewhere are not legally binding.
5.3 Many people choose the executor of their will on the basis of
their legal or financial skills, not realising that they
are also granting that
person the right to dispose of their body. For those who have not left a will,
responsibility for the disposal
of their body will most likely fall to their
partner or closest blood relative.
5.4 Regardless of who controls the disposal of the body, it may trouble a
person to know that any specific instructions they leave
behind do not have to
be adhered to. As discussed below, this may be particularly problematic where
there is ongoing conflict within
family, parents have re-partnered, or family members have different cultural
and religious beliefs.1
Legal foundation
5.5 As discussed in Chapter 3, the finding that a person cannot leave binding
instructions regarding the disposal of their body rests
on the proposition that
no one can own a dead body (the ‘no property’ rule).2 This
proposition is built upon a 1614
Hayne’s case
Williams v Williams
, Justice Kay relied on
4 when declaring, ‘It is quite clearly the law of this country
that there can be no property in the dead body of a human being.’5
Regina v Sharpe
concerned a son who dug up his mother’s
coffin in order to bury her in another location along with his recently deceased
When affirming the son’s conviction for trespass, Justice Erle rejected
the argument that children have property rights in the
bodies of their deceased
parents, stating that ‘Our law recognises no property in a

5.7 While Justice Erle provided no authority for this statement of the law,
it had been promulgated earlier by a number of legal
scholars.8 However, these
scholars either cited each other or
Hayne’s case
Hayne’s case
, the accused was convicted of theft for
digging up dead bodies and stealing the sheets in which the bodies were
wrapped.10 The court
held that the sheets remained the property of the owners
who placed them around the dead bodies as a dead body cannot own property.11
5.9 Despite its questionable history, the ‘no property’ rule was
affirmed in Australia in the High Court case of
Doodeward v Spence
three members of the High Court accepted that immediately after death, a dead
body is not property. However, Chief Justice Griffith
I do not, myself, accept the dogma of the verbal inerrancy of ancient text
writers. Indeed, equally respectable authority, and of
equal antiquity, may be
cited for establishing as a matter of law the reality of witchcraft.12
5.10 In other contexts, such as native title, the concept of property has
evolved beyond the traditional common law notion of the
right to own, and
therefore use, give away or sell, a tangible object.13 In
Yanner v Eaton
the High Court stated:
The word ‘property’ is often used to refer to something that
belongs to another. But ...
‘property’ does not refer to a thing; it is a description of a
legal relationship with a thing. It refers to a degree
of power that is
recognised in law as power permissibly exercised over the thing. The concept of
‘property’ may be elusive.
Usually it is treated as a
‘bundle of rights’. But even this may have its limits as an
analytical tool or accurate description...14
5.11 When property is conceived of in this broader sense, it could be
that there is property in a dead body. As Prue Vines
has argued, conceiving of
property as a bundle of rights and obligations allows for multiple
characterisations of property, ‘including
custodianship for
a communal group which sees the autonomy and the dignity of the deceased as a
central concern, perhaps drawing on the memory and identity
deceased’.15
5.12 The Commission expresses no view on whether a dead body should or should
be thought of as property. The point is that the current legal framework is
built on a proposition that may be open to challenge.
5.13 Several judges have questioned the adequacy of the law’s response
to funeral and burial disputes. In the New South Wales
, Justice Brownie remarked:
It is ... an unhappy fact that the parliament has not seen fit to enact any
statute to deal with the topic so that judges have had
to deal with cases as and
when they are brought forward, on very short notice, on imperfect evidentiary
material, and in circumstances
which all concerned find distressing.16

Warner v Levitt
, the foster parents of the deceased challenged
the biological parents of the deceased for the right to bury the body. The judge
on the evidence before him, although it was contested, that the deceased
had been abused by his biological parents as a young boy,
and that he had
subsequently been in the care of his foster parents for a long time.17
Nonetheless, Justice Brownie granted the biological
parents the right to bury
the body on the ground that, under the common law, ‘blood parents’
have the obligation, and
therefore the right, to bury their dead
children’s bodies.18
5.15 Although some appear to be moving away from this approach,19 Australian
judges have historically dealt with the need to make
quick decisions in
complicated cases by refusing to consider cultural and other concerns. As
Justice Martin stated in the Northern
Territory case of
[The deceased’s parents’] respective legal claims were subsumed
by deep emotion emanating from, and affecting not only
them, but other members
of the deceased’s extended family as well. Questions relating to cultural
values and customs intercede.
To state that the court was asked to make a
decision taking into account matters relating to burial in a homeland and the
of the Roman Catholic faith demonstrates just some of the
imponderables. Further, issues such as these could take a long time
to resolve if they were to be properly tested by evidence in an adversary
situation. A legal solution must be found; not one based
on competing emotions
and the wishes of the living, except in so far as they reflected a legal duty or
right. That solution will
not embrace the resolution of possibly competing
spiritual or cultural values.20
5.16 In the Victorian case of
Leeburn v Derndorfer,
Justice Byrne
described the law’s attempt
to accommodate the concerns of interested parties within a strict hierarchy
of entitlement in complex circumstances as uncharacteristically
5.17 Justice William Young also questioned this approach in the New Zealand
Takamore v Clarke
, observing that there was little logic to the
executor rule and even less logic to the likely administrator rule.22
Legislative exceptions to the ‘no property’ rule
5.18 There are two legislative exceptions to the ‘no property’
rule in Australia, demonstrating that it is not an inflexible
or inviolable
5.19 As discussed at [4.5] – [4.10], every Australian state and
territory except Tasmania upholds instructions of the deceased
regarding their
cremation in certain circumstances. While some states uphold instructions not to
cremate, others uphold instructions
to cremate. Two states uphold both in
certain circumstances.23
5.20 Under the
Human Tissue Act 1982
(Vic) a person’s wish not
to donate their tissue after they die must be adhered to by the authorised
medical practitioner considering
to allow the removal of tissue from their dead body.24 However, a
person’s wish to donate their tissue does not have to be adhered
and, in practice, an authorised medical practitioner will not uphold the wishes
of the deceased where the deceased’s
next of kin objects.
5.21 This legal regime for tissue donation is replicated across
Australia.26

Different social context in which the law is now applied
5.22 Much has changed since the 19th century when it was determined that
people could not leave binding funeral and burial instructions.
5.23 In 1884, Justice Stephen in
stated that it was evident
in previous judgments concerning the disposal of bodies that ‘The law
presumes that everyone will
wish that the bodies of those in whom he was
interested in their lifetime should have Christian burial’. These cases
consider ‘The possibility of a man’s entertaining and acting
upon a different view’.27
5.24 Justice Stephen then held that cremation was lawful in England provided
that it was
not carried out in a manner so as to constitute a public nuisance.28
However, cremation continued to be regarded by many as distasteful,
banned by the Roman Catholic Church in 1886.29
5.25 As noted in Chapter 1, Victoria today is much more diverse than 19th
century England.
With over one-third of all marriages in Australia being re-marriages,30 and
almost one- fifth of Victoria’s population hailing
from a non-English
speaking country,31 it is clear that the religious and cultural assumptions on
which the law is based no longer
necessarily reflect the society in which the
law is now being applied.
5.26 In the 2011 census, 24 per cent of the Victorian population indicated
that they did not follow any religion,32 three per cent
indicated that they
followed Buddhism, and a further three per cent indicated that they followed
5.27 Unfolding alongside these developments has been a greater recognition of
individual autonomy. People now make a variety of choices
in life about how they
wish to recognise their identities and relationships, and they may wish for or
expect that their funeral
and burial arrangements will reflect those choices. It may be considered
disrespectful to the deceased, as well as to adversely affected
survivors, to
make funeral and burial arrangements that are inconsistent with the
deceased’s preferences.

6. Case studies
Introduction
6.1 The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of the most
common types of funeral and burial disputes, and to encourage
people who have
been involved in a funeral and burial dispute to share their experiences with
the Commission.1
6.2 Funeral and burial disputes can occur in any family. However, as
discussed in Chapter 1, the cases that have come before Australian
suggest that families are more likely to have disputes, or are perhaps less able
to resolve disputes, in certain circumstances.
These include where there is
already conflict within the family, where a father or mother has re- partnered
after separating from
the person with whom they had children or where family
members come from different cultural or religious backgrounds.
6.3 Although there are no Australian court cases involving a lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender or intersex (LGBTI) deceased, the
Commission was told
during the course of its preliminary investigation that this is an issue that
affects LGBTI people whose families
have not fully accepted their sexual
orientation, gender identity or intersex status.
Families in conflict
6.4 As Heather Conway and John Stannard have observed, ‘Burial disputes
are a classic example of death fracturing family bonds
or, more often, acting as
a catalyst for the implosion of relationships which were already
strained.’2
Leeburn v Derndorfer,
two sisters buried their father’s
ashes at a cemetery of their choosing without informing their brother.3 Their
brother was
upset that he had not been consulted and wanted the ashes dug up and
split three ways so that he could bury his portion of the ashes
at a cemetery
closer to his home. The sisters felt that dividing the ashes was
‘disgusting, even sacrilegious’.4 Justice
Byrne decided that, as
the ashes had been at the cemetery for four years, and as this location had been
selected by two of the deceased’s
three executors (the third being the
deceased’s son), the ashes should remain where they were.5

6.6 In reaching this conclusion, Justice Byrne expressed an apprehension
‘that the division between [the siblings] on this matter
represents a
manifestation of some more deep- seated hostility which I cannot
resolve.’6 Justice Byrne further observed that,
in cases like this, the
tension between the deceased’s wishes, the bereaved’s wishes and
other cultural, social and religious
factors made resolving funeral and burial
disputes difficult, ‘especially where they are based on feelings which are
held at a time of great emotional stress and which are difficult to
justify, or even explain, in any rational way’.7
Blended families
Manktelow v The Public Trustee & Ors
involved a dispute
between the deceased’s partner of ten years and the deceased’s three
children from an earlier marriage.
The deceased was living in Perth with her
partner at the time of her death, and had stated in her will that
she wanted to be buried, without identifying where. Her partner wanted to
bury her in Perth. Although her children initially wanted
to cremate her in
South Australia, they later told the court that they wished to bury her in South
Australia. According to one of
the deceased’s daughters, her
mother’s partner was hostile towards her mother’s family and had
damaged relations
between them.8
6.8 Justice Hasluck held that the body should be buried in Perth because,
among other reasons, the law favours the wishes of a de
facto partner over the
wishes of children, transferring the body to South Australia may result in an
unreasonable delay in the deceased’s
burial, and transferring the body to
South Australia may amount to an unjustifiable expense given the small size of
the estate.9
Cross-cultural families
6.9 As stated above, almost half of the cases that have come before
Australian courts have involved Aboriginal deceased.10
Jones v Dodd
Dow v Hoskins,
both of which were discussed in Chapter 3
a dispute between the birth family of an Aboriginal deceased and the
deceased’s non-Aboriginal partner.11
Calma v Sesar
involved a dispute between two Aboriginal parents
from different parts of Australia.12 While the deceased’s mother wanted
to hold a Roman Catholic funeral
and burial in Darwin, the deceased’s father argued that his culture
dictates that the dead should be buried in their homeland
and that the homeland
of the deceased was Bardi country in Western Australia. After deciding that he
could not take competing spiritual
or cultural values into account, Justice Martin found in favour of the mother
as the deceased’s body was in Darwin, arrangements
had already been made
for the deceased’s burial, and he found no reason to interfere with these
arrangements.
Tufala v Marsden
concerned a deceased woman from New Zealand
whose parents were from the Tokelau Islands, a Polynesian island group near
deceased’s husband wished to cremate his wife in Brisbane,
which is where they were living at the time of
her death. The deceased’s birth family wished to bury the deceased in
New Zealand in accordance with Tokelauan custom. Before
the judge handed down
his decision, the parties agreed that the husband would hold a funeral in
Brisbane, before transporting the
deceased’s body, at the birth
family’s cost, to New Zealand.13

6.12 When granting the application to withdraw the application to restrain
the husband from cremating the body, Judge Atkinson observed
deceased’s husband had the right to dispose of her body and that the
deceased had expressed a wish to be buried in
her family’s plot in
accordance with Tokelauan custom. The judge continued:
The Tokelauan traditions for burial are quite detailed and involve the
deceased’s body being given back to the family and placed
on traditional
mats, the body being prepared in accordance with their customs and for at least
two days the relatives coming and
sitting around the body to grieve and holding
a family mass and praying together. After the grieving process the body is taken
a church. The deceased’s body is buried and not cremated. It is
important in Tokelauan tradition that the deceased is not buried
deceased and her husband had no children, and in accordance with her custom, she
would be buried in the family plot, otherwise
her family fear she will have a
restless spirit.14
Families with LGBTI members
6.13 The Commission does not know of an Australian case in which the sexual
orientation, gender identity or intersex status of an
LGBTI deceased contributed
to a dispute among survivors about how to dispose of the deceased. However, the
Commission was advised
anecdotally that such disputes do occur, and the impact
can cause ongoing harm to the memory of the deceased as well as to
survivors.15
6.14 In a case that came before a court in New York, the deceased’s
partner of five years challenged the right of the deceased’s
brother to the deceased’s body. While the mother and brother wanted to
hold an Orthodox Jewish funeral, the partner
wanted to hold a small ceremony in
the home he had shared with the deceased and then cremate the body, in
accordance with the deceased’s
oral wishes.16 According to the partner,
the deceased had actively distanced himself from his Jewish heritage, was
agnostic and
was estranged from his mother. While the court confirmed that the
wishes of the deceased regarding their disposal are to be given
primacy over all
others, and indicated that it may thus have awarded the body to the partner so
that he could carry out the deceased’s
wishes, the parties agreed to
cremate the body and divide his ashes before the court handed down its
decision.17

Options for reform
36 Introduction
37 Option 1: Enshrine the common law position in legislation
37 Option 2: Oblige the person with the right to control the disposal of a
body to make appropriate funeral and burial arrangements
after taking relevant
factors into account
39 Option 3: Allow people to leave binding funeral and burial
instructions
42 Option 4: Allow people to appoint a funeral and burial agent
44 Alternative options
7. Options for reform
Introduction
7.1 Following the Commission’s consideration of the law relating to
funeral and burial instructions in Australia, Canada, England,
New Zealand and
the United States,1 the Commission puts forward four options for reform, each
of which would require legislative
• Option 1: Enshrine the common law position in legislation.
• Option 2: Oblige the person with the right to control the disposal of
a body to make appropriate funeral and burial arrangements
after taking relevant
factors into account.
• Option 3: Allow people to leave binding funeral and burial
instructions.
• Option 4: Allow people to appoint a funeral and burial agent.
7.2 The distinction between instructions to cremate and all other funeral and
burial instructions, which is found in legislation across
Australia, seems
likely to have emerged in response to society’s discomfort with the move
away from Christian burials.2 Among
Victorians today, cremation is a more prevalent method of disposal than
burial,3 and there appears to be no cogent reason to maintain
distinction.
7.3 When providing feedback on the options, you may wish to simply state that
you are for
or against them. However, as Options 2, 3 and 4 raise detailed questions
welcome additional
comments on these options.
7.4 A combination of options could be adopted in Victoria. For example, the
law could allow people to leave binding funeral and burial
instructions and/or
appoint a funeral and burial agent to control the disposal of their body. Where
a deceased did not leave instructions,
the person disposing of their body could
be required to make appropriate arrangements after taking certain factors into
7.5 Alternatively, greater importance could be placed on the experience of
survivors by making the deceased’s wishes just one
of the factors the
person in control of disposal must take into account when making appropriate
funeral and burial arrangements,
even where the deceased left clear written
instructions that are at odds with the wishes of survivors. This regime could
with or without the ability to appoint a funeral and burial agent.

7.6 It may be that stakeholders would like to maintain the common law
position in Victoria, and the first question in this chapter
allows stakeholders
to indicate that this is their preference. The final question in this chapter
invites proposals for reforms not
covered in the options already provided.
2 Is the law on funeral and burial instructions satisfactory as it
Option 1: Enshrine the common law position in legislation
7.7 The common law position in Victoria is that the executor or likely
administrator of a deceased person’s estate has, subject
exceptions, an absolute right to decide how the body should be disposed of.4
7.8 One advantage of this position is that it allows for a quick and often
predictable outcome, which may limit the trauma experienced
by survivors, even,
or perhaps especially, where they are in conflict.5 Another advantage of this
position is that the person with
to dispose of the body is the same as the person with the obligation to pay
for disposal.
7.9 Enshrining the common law position in legislation is likely to make the
law more accessible and widely known, while maintaining
these advantages.
3 Should the common law position on funeral and burial instructions be
enshrined in legislation?
Option 2: Oblige the person with the right to control the disposal of a
body to make appropriate funeral and burial arrangements after
taking relevant
factors into account
7.10 In New Zealand, the person with the right to control the disposal of a
body must make appropriate funeral and burial arrangements
after taking into
account the deceased’s wishes, the views of family members and the
deceased’s cultural or religious
background. They may also take into
account the need to dispose of the deceased without undue delay.6
7.11 The obligation for executors and likely administrators to exercise their
authority in this way comes into effect when nothing
is done to dispose of a
body or a dispute arises.7 Where family and friends agree on a deceased’s
funeral and burial arrangements,
there is no
need for the executor or likely administrator to intervene.

7 See [3.35].
C v Advocate General for Scotland,
8 a Scottish court imposed
a similar decision-making process on Scottish executors, albeit without regard
to the will of the deceased.
After noting that ‘executors have to be
careful and aware that they have to act in the best interests of the
Lord Brodie stated:
an analogous duty should be considered as being owed in respect of the
personal interests of the deceased’s family in relation
to [the] dignified
treatment of his body and the making of
appropriate
arrangements.9
7.13 According to Lord Brodie, a Scottish executor has ‘custody of a
body for the purpose of burial ... in a quasi-fiduciary
capacity, subject to the
claims of near relatives.’10 Elaborating on this point, Lord Brodie
I do not see [the Scottish executor] as having the right to arrange burial
subject only to special circumstances which would appear
to be the case with his
English equivalent. No doubt there will be circumstances in which it will be
appropriate for a Scottish executor
to proceed to arrange for the conduct of the
burial but only after consulting with the wishes of the near relatives. In the
of divergence of view I can see that the executor may have to come to a
decision but only after giving consideration to
such proposals as the family have to make. The executor who merely consulted
his own preferences would be failing his duties.11
7.14 Adopting this option would ensure that, in the event of a dispute, the
views of all interested parties were taken into account.
Considering the wishes
of survivors alongside the wishes of the deceased may assist with the grieving
process of survivors while
also recognising the autonomy of the deceased.
4 Should the law oblige a person with the right to control the disposal of
a body to make appropriate funeral and burial arrangements
after taking into
(a) the wishes of the deceased
(b) the views of the family
(c) the deceased’s cultural or religious background
(d) the need to dispose of the deceased without undue delay
(e) the capacity of the estate to cover the reasonable costs of disposal
(f) any other factors?

Specific considerations
Duty to seek out the views of others
7.15 In New Zealand, the person with the right to dispose of the body is not
obliged to seek out the views of others when making funeral
arrangements.12 As the majority stated in
Takamore v Clarke
the personal representative should take account of the views of those close
to the deceased, which are known or conveyed to him or
her. This will include
views that arise from customary, cultural and religious practices, which a
member of the deceased’s
family ... considers should be observed ... There
is no requirement, however, for
the personal representative to engage in consultation. That may not be
practical in circumstances of urgency.13
7.16 During the Commission’s preliminary consultations, however, a
representative from the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service
said that where there
is conflict about funeral and burial arrangements, it is important to reach
consensus as a family.14 One advantage
of imposing a duty to seek out the views
of others on the person controlling the disposal
of the body is that it may facilitate agreement among the family members
5 If the law obliges a person with the right to control the disposal of a
body to make an appropriate decision after taking into account
certain factors,
should that person have a duty to seek out the views of people close to the
deceased before making a decision?
Option 3: Allow people to leave binding funeral and burial
instructions
7.17 Adopting this option would allow a person with legal capacity to leave
binding instructions in relation to the method and place
of the final disposal
of their body, as well as any associated rituals.
7.18 The obligation to carry out the instructions would fall on any survivor
controlling the disposal of the body, not just the person
with the right to
dispose of the body. This is because it is often the case that a person other
than the person with the right to
dispose of the body is tasked with arranging
the funeral and burial. For example, an adult child might arrange their
funeral instead of the lawyer appointed by the mother to be her
7.19 Allowing people to leave binding funeral and burial instructions would
reflect our community’s emphasis on individual autonomy.
Moreover, it
would allow people to
ensure that all of their identities and relationships were reflected in their
funeral and burial arrangements in accordance with their
priorities.
Takamore v Clarke
[2012] NZSC 116
13 Ibid [156].
14 Preliminary consultation with Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (6 August
6 Should people be able to leave legally binding funeral and burial
instructions?
Specific considerations
7.20 As discussed in Chapter 3, courts in the United States have recognised a
range of circumstances in which validly made funeral
and burial instructions do
not have to be adhered to by the person disposing of the body.15 These include
where the person’s
later conduct indicated that they had changed their
mind, and where performance was impossible.
7.21 Chapter 4 outlines the circumstances in which legislation in Canada and
the United States allows the person with the right to
dispose of the body to
depart from funeral and burial instructions.16 In addition to the circumstances
identified above, they include
the circumstance where complying with the
instructions would be impractical, unlawful, unreasonable or excessively
7.22 Inquiries by other law reform commissions into funeral and burial
instructions have determined that instructions should also
not be legally
binding if they are offensive or indecent, or if they could not be located
within a reasonable time after death.18
Form of instructions
7.23 The form instructions must take differs across jurisdictions that
recognise funeral and burial instructions. While almost all
states in the United
States require written instructions, in Colorado they need only be written and
signed,19 whereas in Texas they
must be witnessed by a notary public.20 In New
Jersey, they must be written in a will.21
7.24 In Quebec, Canada, a person’s oral instructions must be followed,
provided the intention of the deceased was clear and
unequivocal.22 In Montana,
a person can leave recorded oral instructions as long as they are accompanied by
a written document in
which two adult witnesses attest to the accuracy of the
recording.23
7.25 In Victoria, a person can orally object in the presence of two witnesses
during their last illness to the subsequent removal
of tissue from their dead
body.24 A person can orally consent to the removal of their tissue in the same
manner but, as explained
at [5.20], their consent can be overridden by their
next of kin.25
15 See [3.47].
16 See [4.12] and [4.17] – [4.18].
17 This last exemption is expressed differently in different states. In
Texas, the person controlling the disposal of a body must
deceased’s instructions to the extent that the deceased’s estate or
the agent is ‘financially able to
do so’: Tex Health & Safety
711.002(g) (2014). In Maine, it is to the extent that the deceased
‘left resources for the purpose of carrying out those wishes’:
Rev Stat Ann tit 22 § 2843-A(5) (2015). In New York, it is ‘to the
extent lawful and practicable, including consideration
of the financial capacity
of the decedent’s estate and other resources made available for
disposition of the remains’:

7.26 Reducing the steps people must take in order to leave valid funeral and
burial instructions allows people to make such instructions
more easily. This is
particularly important for marginalised communities, including people with
limited English language skills and
people who are unfamiliar with the formal
requirements of our legal system.
7.27 However, reducing the steps people must take to produce valid
instructions also increases the risk that the instructions may
not reflect the
person’s true wishes. As Justices Tipping, McGrath and Blanchard observed
in relation to oral wishes in
Takamore v Clarke
, for example, a court may
‘need to consider the possibility that something was said out of a desire
to please the person to
whom the deceased was speaking’.26
Age of the person leaving instructions
7.28 While most jurisdictions that uphold funeral and burial instructions
require the person leaving instructions to be over 18,27
in Quebec people under
the age of 18 may leave instructions with the consent of their guardian.28
Borrows v HM Coroner for Preston
, a 15-year-old boy’s
phobia of worms and thus burial was one of the elements considered by the judge
when awarding the right
of disposal to his uncle who wanted to cremate him,
rather than his mother who wanted to bury him.29
7.30 In Victoria, a person under 18 can consent to medical treatment if they
have sufficient intellectual capacity and emotional maturity
to understand the
nature and consequences of the medical treatment.30 A person under 18 can also
make a will if they are married
or have obtained a court order authorising the
making of a will.31 A 16-year-old can register to be an organ donor,32 and a
14-year-old’s

7 If people are able to leave legally binding funeral and burial
instructions:
(a) In what circumstances should a person controlling the final disposal of
a body be exempt from carrying out the instructions?
(b) Should there be a requirement that the instructions be: (i) contained
(ii) in written form, or
(iii) in any form as long as the expression of intention is
(c) Should children be allowed to leave instructions and, if so, at what
age and/or in what circumstances?

Option 4: Allow people to appoint a funeral and burial agent
7.31 In a number of jurisdictions in the United States, people are allowed to
appoint a funeral and burial agent to control the disposal
of their body after
they die. The agent must comply with the deceased’s instructions where
instructions were left, but may
otherwise decide where and how to dispose of the
body.34 See Appendix B for an example of the prescribed agent appointment form
7.32 Allowing people to appoint a funeral and burial agent would enable them
to appoint the person most suited to the role in the
circumstances. Unlike
executors who are often chosen for their financial or legal skills, a funeral
and burial agent might be chosen
for their peacekeeping skills within the
family, or for their religious status. If a person has not yet been in a
relationship for
two years, they may wish to appoint their partner as their
agent, as their partner would not be recognised as their unregistered
partner under Victorian law.35 This may be particularly important if they are in
a relationship their parents do not approve
of and the right to bury their body
would go to their parents upon their death.
7.33 Allowing people to appoint a funeral and burial agent without also
allowing them to leave binding instructions would address
the concern that
people cannot know every eventuality that may arise upon their death. It could
be, for example, that carrying out
a person’s instructions inadvertently
causes their family members great distress and that, had the person been aware
before their death, they would have left different instructions.
8 Should people be able to appoint a funeral and burial agent to control
the final disposal of their body?
Specific considerations
Making the appointment
7.34 In some jurisdictions in the United States, a person can nominate
a funeral and burial agent who does not need to consent
to the nomination before
the person’s death. If the nominated agent does not wish to act, they can
simply opt out. This is
the case in Delaware, where a person can also nominate
an alternative agent in case the primary agent is ‘unwilling or unable
7.35 In other states, the agent must sign the appointment form before the
person dies in order for the appointment to be valid.37
In Texas, a person can
appoint a number of alternative agents in case their preferred agent
‘dies, becomes legally disabled,
resigns or refuses
to act’,38 and each of the alternative agents is also required to sign
the appointment
form before the person’s death.39 If a person’s nominated agents
fail to act for whatever reason, control of the body
goes to the next person in
the statutory hierarchy, which is the spouse, followed by the children, and so
34 See [4.15].
Administration and Probate Act 1958
(‘unregistered domestic partner’).

37 Tex Code Ann § 711.002(b) (2014).
40 Tex Code Ann § 711.002(a) (2014).
Forfeiting the appointment
7.36 A funeral and burial agent will be deemed to have forfeited the right to
control the disposal of a body in a number of jurisdictions
in the United States
if they are dead, lack legal capacity, refuse to act or are separated or
estranged from the deceased.41
7.37 In some states, the right is forfeited if the agent is charged with the
murder or manslaughter of the deceased.42 In Ohio, the
right is revived if the
charges are dropped or the person is acquitted.43 In New Hampshire, an agent
need only be arrested for the
deceased’s murder or manslaughter to forfeit
the right.44
7.38 In New Jersey, the agent will forfeit the right if, at the time of the
person’s death, the person had an intervention order
in place against the
Funeral and burial costs
7.39 As noted above in relation to Option 1, the person with the right
to bury a deceased person’s body is the same as
the person with the
obligation to pay for the deceased person’s funeral and burial. This
person is obliged to use the deceased’s
estate to pay
for the reasonable costs of disposal, which are determined in accordance with
the value of the deceased’s estate,46 unless
someone else chooses to pay
for it. The obligation
to pay for the funeral and burial out of the deceased’s estate arises
even where a stranger intervenes as a matter of necessity
to dispose of the body
without the personal representative’s knowledge.47
7.40 Allowing people to appoint a funeral and burial agent would upset the
symmetry that currently exists between the person with
the right to dispose of
the body and the person with the obligation to pay for disposal. Jurisdictions
in the United States have
adopted a range of approaches to address this issue.
In New York, the agent may recover reasonable funeral expenses from the executor
or administrator of the estate.48 In Mississippi, the deceased must have left
instructions in a prepaid contract that has been fully
paid, or the instructions
will not be valid.49 In Rhode Island, the agent must agree to ‘ensure
payment for all outstanding
expenses’,50 which presumably means they are
liable where the deceased has not set aside funds for their funeral and burial,
or the value of their estate is insufficient to cover the costs.51
9 If people are able to appoint a funeral and burial agent:
(a) Should they be required to obtain the agent’s consent for the
appointment to be valid?
(b) In what circumstances should the agent forfeit the right to control
the disposal of the body?
(c) Who should be liable for the costs of disposal and what, if any,
measures are needed to make the arrangement practical?

emerged out of the Commission’s cross-jurisdictional
review of common law
and legislative responses to funeral and burial disputes.
7.42 The Commission also welcomes proposals for alternative options. Any
proposal must address the central concern of the Commission,
which is how best
to incorporate the wishes of the deceased into the process by which funeral and
burial arrangements are made.

49 Mediation
8. Resolving disputes
Introduction
8.1 Stakeholders the Commission consulted during its preliminary
investigations expressed the view that the court and mediation services
available to survivors involved in funeral and burial disputes could be
8.2 Except where the Coroners Court of Victoria has control over a
deceased’s body, the Supreme Court of Victoria and the County
Victoria have the power to intervene in funeral and burial disputes.
8.3 Where a death is investigated by the Coroners Court, a coroner must
decide who to release the body to once they no longer need
it for their
investigation, including when more than one person claims the body. If a person
who applied to a coroner to have the
body released to them believes that the
coroner erred in their application of the law, the person may appeal to the
Supreme Court.
8.4 Parties to a Supreme Court or County Court proceeding may seek, or be
ordered, to undertake mediation, usually at the cost of
the parties involved. In
addition, the Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria offers free mediation
services to people involved in
disputes that are suitable for mediation in that
Supreme Court
Leeburn v Derndorfer
, Justice Byrne stated that ‘it is
well established that the court has the power to intervene in order to resolve
disputes as
to who is to undertake the task of disposing of the body and as to
the manner and place of disposition’.2
8.6 Rule 54.02 of the
Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules 2005
(Vic) allows people to seek a determination or order in relation to the
administration of a deceased person’s estate without
proceedings for general administration.3 Justice Ashley, in
Meier v Bell,
confirmed that this was the proper process for commencing proceedings in
relation to a funeral and burial dispute.4

8.7 Where a matter before the Supreme Court requires immediate attention,
parties to a proceeding may make an urgent application to
appear before the
Practice Court of the Supreme Court, which can be contacted after hours.5 Six of
the seven cases involving a funeral
and burial dispute that have come before the
Supreme Court in the past 30 years have been dealt with in this way.6
8.8 The Supreme Court may grant injunctions ordering people to do, or not to
do, specific acts, in a range of circumstances.7 This
would be useful where,
for example, a party wanted to prevent an imminent burial or cremation from
taking place.
8.9 At present, the combined cost of the filing fee and the summons to attend
$1389.90,8 although these costs can be waived in limited circumstances.9
County Court
8.10 Like the Supreme Court, the County Court has unlimited civil
County Court Civil Procedure Rules 2008
(Vic) allows people to seek a determination or order in relation to the
administration of a deceased person’s estate without
proceedings for general administration.11 While it thus appears that the County
Court also has jurisdiction over funeral
and burial disputes, the Commission is
not aware of a case of this kind that has come before the County Court.
8.11 The County Court hears urgent applications and can grant injunctive
relief in a range of circumstances.12 The filing fee is
$814.60,13 although
this cost can be waived in limited circumstances.14
Coroners Court
8.12 There are a number of circumstances in which a death must be reported to
the Coroners Court, including where the death appears
to have been unexpected,
unnatural or violent.15 If a coroner determines the death requires
investigation, the body will be taken
into the care of the Court.16
8.13 A coroner may release the body once they are satisfied it is no
longer necessary for their investigation and, when doing
so, must identify the
person the body is to be released to and may specify conditions of
8.14 Where two or more people apply for the release of the body, the coroner
must determine who has the better claim, after having
regard to the fact that an
applicant who is the deceased’s executor should be given highest priority
and that, where there
is no executor, the deceased’s body should be
released to the senior next of kin.18 Senior next of kin is defined in the
Coroners Act 2008
(Vic) as the deceased’s spouse or domestic
partner, followed by the deceased’s adult children, followed by the
parents, and so

8.15 Any person exercising a function under the
Coroners Act 2008
(Vic) should have regard to the fact that different cultures have different
beliefs and practices surrounding death that should be
respected where it is
appropriate to do so.20 In
Carter v The Coroners Court of Victoria
Justice Almond held that evidence of culture, belief and practices may influence
the question of ‘whether the body
be released to the senior
next of kin’.21
8.16 A person who applied for the body may appeal to the Supreme Court in
relation to the coroner’s decision concerning who
the body should be
released to or the terms of release.22 The appeal must concern a question of
law, not of fact.23 Where the appeal
is successful, it is for the Supreme Court
to decide who the body should be released to and the conditions of release, if
Alternative jurisdictions
8.17 If granted jurisdiction, funeral and burial disputes could be heard by
the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria or the Victorian
Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).
8.18 The Magistrates’ Court typically hears civil matters where claims
do not exceed $100,000, as well as other nominated civil
disputes, such as
family violence intervention order matters.25 It currently costs $441.90 to
bring an urgent matter before a magistrate.26
8.19 The Law Reform Commission of Western Australia recommended that the
Magistrates Court of Western Australia be given jurisdiction
over funeral and
burial disputes that do not involve funeral and burial instructions.27 Disputes
involving instructions should,
according to the Commission, continue to be heard
by the Supreme Court of Western Australia.28
8.20 VCAT was established to resolve disputes in a number of specialised
areas.29 VCAT proceedings are less formal than court proceedings,
with parties
often representing themselves. A party may appeal on questions of law to the
Supreme Court.30
8.21 In addition to its Civil and Administrative Divisions, VCAT has a Human
Rights Division which deals with guardianship and discrimination
cases, among
other matters.31 Except for cases concerning exemptions from the
Opportunity Act 2010
(Vic), there are no filing fees for matters that fall
within the Human Rights Division.

8.22 Among the factors stakeholders may wish to take into account when
considering which jurisdictions should hear funeral and burial
disputes are:
• the cost of proceedings
• the formality of proceedings
• the capacity of parties to participate in proceedings
• the expertise of the arbiters
• the powers available to the arbiters
• the resources of the court/tribunal
• the location of the court/tribunal
• the consequences of splitting jurisdiction
• the consequences of granting concurrent jurisdiction.
11 Which court/s and/or tribunal should have jurisdiction over funeral and
burial disputes and why?
8.23 Parties to a Supreme Court or County Court proceeding may ask the Court
to refer the matter to mediation, or the Court may order
the parties to undergo
mediation at any stage of the proceeding.32
8.24 Parties to a Supreme Court proceeding may have their matter
mediated by an associate judge, judicial registrar or prothonotary
Court,33 or by an external accredited mediator, such as those on the Victorian
Bar’s list of accredited mediators.34
8.25 Parties to a County Court proceeding may have their matter mediated by
an external mediator or a judicial registrar.35
8.26 The cost of mediation is shared by the parties, unless the court orders
otherwise.36
8.27 The Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria provides free, confidential
mediation services unless the matter is deemed unsuitable
for mediation in that
forum, such as where the matter involves family violence.37 Mediation can
usually be arranged within a fortnight
and it can be held at a location that is
convenient for the parties.38

practicable, the hearing of funeral and burial disputes
be preceded by

Attorney-General liaise with stakeholders
to establish which organisation/s
might be best placed to offer culturally appropriate and immediate
mediation.40
8.29 The Queensland Law Reform Commission formed the view that the free
mediation services provided through the Dispute Resolution
Centres of the
Department of Justice and Attorney-General, in conjunction with those provided
in Supreme Court proceedings and by
