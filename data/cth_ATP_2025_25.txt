INTRODUCTION
Panel, Alberto Colla, Jon Gidney and Nicola Wakefield Evans AM (sitting
President), declined to make a declaration of unacceptable
circumstances in
relation to the affairs of PointsBet Holdings Limited. The application
concerned an unsolicited all-scrip, reverse
takeover offer from betr. PointsBet
submitted that unacceptable circumstances arose from the combination of
disclosure issues (including
in betr’s bidder’s statement) and
structural issues (including the Selective Share Buy-Back) in relation to the
Bid. The Panel decided not to make a declaration after accepting
undertakings provided by betr that (among other things) betr would
replacement bidder’s statement with corrective disclosure to the Panel's
satisfaction, seek shareholder approval
for the Selective Share Buy-Back only
with the benefit of an independent expert’s report and at the same time as
the shareholder
approval required for the issue of betr shares under the betr
Bid, and offer withdrawal rights (or not open the betr Bid) for a certain

26 February 2025, PointsBet announced it had entered into a scheme
implementation deed with MIXI, Inc and MIXI Australia for the
acquisition by
MIXI Australia of 100% of the issued share capital of PointsBet by way of a
scheme of arrangement (
MIXI Scheme
). Under the MIXI Scheme, MIXI
Australia offered PointsBet shareholders $1.06 cash for each PointsBet
on 26 February 2025, betr (then BlueBet Holdings Limited) announced it had made
an offer to acquire PointsBet by way of a scheme
of arrangement, offering a
combination of cash and betr shares.
27 February 2025, PointsBet announced that the PointsBet board had determined
that the betr proposal could not reasonably be expected
to lead to a superior
proposal to the MIXI Scheme.
28 April 2025, betr announced that it had acquired a relevant interest of 19.9%
in PointsBet.
29 April 2025, betr announced a revised proposal to acquire 100% of the shares
not already owned by betr in PointsBet, again offering
a combination of cash and
betr shares.
12 May 2025, PointsBet announced that the PointsBet board had determined that
the revised betr proposal could reasonably be expected
to lead to a superior
proposal, as defined in the scheme implementation deed between PointsBet, MIXI
Inc and MIXI Australia. PointsBet
proposed that a form of mutual due diligence
be undertaken by PointsBet and betr.
16 June 2025, PointsBet announced that MIXI Australia agreed to make an
off-market takeover bid for all the issued share capital
of PointsBet at $1.20
cash per PointsBet shares, being the same consideration offered under the MIXI
Scheme at that time, conditional
on (among other matters) the MIXI Scheme not
being approved by the requisite majorities of PointsBet shareholders.
on 16 June 2025, PointsBet announced that the PointsBet board had unanimously
decided to reject betr’s 29 April 2025 proposal.
20 June 2025, betr announced its intention to make an off-market, all-scrip
takeover offer for all shares in PointsBet not already
held by betr (
) comprising 3.81 betr shares for every 1 PointsBet share. betr stated
that the ratio equated to $1.22 per PointsBet share and that
the betr Bid was to
underpinned
by a selective share buy-back for
accepting PointsBet shareholders at $1.22 per share (
Selective Share
25 June 2025, the MIXI Scheme was not approved by PointsBet shareholders at the
scheme meeting. This was principally due to betr
voting its 19.9% Pointsbet
shareholding against the MIXI Scheme, consistent with betr's previously publicly
stated voting intention.
26 June 2025, MIXI Australia announced its intention to make an off-market
takeover offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares
in PointsBet (
) for an all-cash consideration of $1.20 per PointsBet share.
16 July 2025, betr lodged its bidder’s statement in relation to the betr
betr Bidder’s Statement
). In an announcement released on the
same day, betr made the following statements (footnotes omitted, other than
footnote 1):
betr’s Offer of 3.81 betr shares for every 1 PointsBet Share
held (the Offer Consideration) equates to $1.22 per PointsBet share
(based on a
$0.32 betr share price)
, which is superior to MIXI’s offer of
$1.20 cash per PointsBet Share.
The combination of the Offer Consideration (based on a value of
$1.22 per PointsBet share
) and the value of the cost synergies
(estimated at up to $0.67 per PointsBet share) equate to up to $1.89 in
potential value per
PointsBet share.
With footnote 1 reading as follows: “
Note: $0.32 per betr Share has
been chosen as it represents the price at which betr completed an oversubscribed
equity raising of
$130 million in May 2025 for the purposes of a proposed
acquisition of PointsBet. VWAPs for betr Shares traded on ASX as at 16 July
were: 30-day VWAP ($0.294), 60-day VWAP ($0.307) and 90-day VWAP ($0.306) (based
on Iress data). The closing price of betr Shares
on 16 July 2025 was $0.27 which
implies a value of the Offer Consideration of $1.03. Due to the low levels of
trading in betr Shares,
the trading prices on ASX over any given period may not
be an appropriate measure of the value of betr Shares and care should be
when using short term trading prices to value betr Shares or the Offer
Consideration.
betr Bidder’s Statement stated that the betr Bid was subject to limited
conditions including that betr shareholders vote
in favour of a resolution to
issue betr shares as offer consideration under the betr Bid under ASX Listing
Consideration
17 July 2025, MIXI Australia lodged its bidder’s statement in relation to
the MIXI Bid and PointsBet announced that the PointsBet
directors unanimously
recommended that PointsBet shareholders accept the MIXI Bid in the absence of a
superior proposal.
24 July 2025, betr released a notice of extraordinary general meeting

) for betr shareholders to consider a
special resolution to approve the Selective Share Buy-Back (
APPLICATION
Declaration sought
application dated 29 July 2025, PointsBet sought a declaration of unacceptable
circumstances. PointsBet submitted that there were
a number of disclosure
issues in the betr Bidder’s Statement, Buy-Back Notice of Meeting and
related announcements, including
in relation to:
(a) the value of the consideration offered under the betr Bid, which PointsBet
submitted was “
presented in a highly misleading and unbalanced way, and
which fails to adequately explain the assumptions and sensitivities affecting
(b) the synergies which betr relied upon in valuing its offer consideration,
which PointsBet submitted “
contain material errors and are presented in
a misleading, incomplete and unbalanced manner
further submitted (among other things) that:
(a) by promoting the Selective Share Buy-Back, betr was seeking
effect to offer PointsBet shareholders a cash alternative to the all‑scrip
outside the betr Bid, which represented
inducement to encourage acceptance”
of the betr Bid in
contravention of the collateral benefits provision in
section 623
and was otherwise
(b) betr breached the policy behind the minimum bid price rule in
section 621(3) by inflating its share price through announcing
the Selective Share Buy-Back in the Buy-Back Notice of Meeting at a key time for
valuing betr’s scrip consideration
for the purposes of the minimum bid
price rule and
(c) betr’s Executive Chairman, Mr Matthew Tripp, failed to disclose
the true extent of his and his associates’ voting
power in betr.
submitted that the circumstances adversely affected the market for control of
PointsBet and the acquisition of control of
PointsBet was not taking place in an
efficient, competitive and informed market.
Interim order sought
sought an interim order that betr be restrained from dispatching the betr
Bidder’s Statement until the disclosure
deficiencies identified by
PointsBet were rectified or until further order.
Final orders sought
sought final orders, including to:
(a) restrain betr from undertaking the Selective Share Buy-Back
(b) require betr to provide a replacement bidder’s statement to address
the disclosure deficiencies in the betr Bidder’s
Statement and
(c) require Mr Tripp to provide corrective substantial holder disclosure.
Interim order
submitted that the interim order was sought to preserve the status quo pending
the Panel’s consideration of its application,
and to avoid material
prejudice to PointsBet shareholders. It also submitted that:
(a) the interim order sought to prevent PointsBet shareholders from making an
uninformed decision based on “
significant misleading or deceptive
representations and other information deficiencies that are currently in the
market in the form
of the Betr Bidder’s Statement and associated public
announcements made by Betr
(b) the evidence as to unacceptable circumstances was strong and given the
significance and materiality of the disclosure deficiencies,
it may not be
possible to “
reverse the misleading impression created
the betr Bidder’s Statement was dispatched and
(c) PointsBet had sought to resolve the deficiencies with betr by communicating
the issues over the period 19 July 2025 to 28 July
2025 but its concerns
remained unresolved.
President considered the interim order sought by PointsBet on an urgent basis
and betr was invited to make submissions, including
as to whether it was willing
to hold off on dispatching its bidder’s statement for a period and, if so,
what period.
submitted that:
betr’s intention prior to receipt of the Panel application
this afternoon was to dispatch its bidder’s statement tomorrow
prior to market open in order to open its offer at the first available
opportunity. betr's intention remains to open its
offer as soon as it is able to
(b) even a short delay in the betr Bid would give MIXI Australia a significant
advantage and cause material harm to betr given the
MIXI Bid was open and
accumulating acceptances (despite lodging its bidder’s statement after
(c) the information deficiencies alleged by PointsBet were not significant and
could be cured by supplemental disclosure and
(d) PointsBet’s application was made on the afternoon prior to the
available dispatch date and PointsBet could have raised
the question of
restraining dispatch sooner.
also briefly addressed each of the issues raised in PointsBet’s
application, objecting to all of them.
lists the policy
considerations that guide the Panel’s approach to restraining dispatch of
takeover documents, including relevantly
(a) frequent or routine delaying of documents encourages tactical litigation,
which goes against the Panel’s purpose
documents should be complete and not misleading when released. The
Panel prefers that information is provided in fewer, comprehensive
comprehensible documents, rather than in correcting, supplementary documents.
Generally speaking, the information test is - what
would offerees and their
advisers reasonably expect to be told to make informed investment
(footnote omitted)
(c) whether the information deficiency can be adequately remedied by
supplementary disclosure and other relief (eg, extension of
the closing date of
the bid) and
(d) the likely length of the delay, with a shorter delay likely to cause less
Panel also encourages parties first to seek to negotiate amendments themselves
and resolve as many issues as possible before the
document is released. An
application that clearly sets out the attempts made by the applicant to resolve
the issues in good faith
is a relevant factor that will guide the Panel’s
decision with regards to restraining a bidder’s
the President noted that the parties had engaged with the issues at stake prior
to PointsBet’s application, as detailed
in letters between
PointsBet’s legal adviser and betr’s legal adviser and attached to
the application.
President considered that the interim order request was made in the context of a
bona fide dispute. He also considered that the
issues referred to in the
application related to fundamental aspects of the betr Bid, including the value
of the bid and the expected
synergies, and was not satisfied that subsequent
correction would remove the effects of any misleading disclosure in the betr
President was also satisfied that betr and PointsBet shareholders were unlikely
to suffer a material prejudice as a result of
the interim order given:
(a) the sitting Panel was likely to resolve the issues promptly so that the
interim order would only be effective for a short period
(b) the sitting Panel (once appointed) could decide to lift the interim order
(c) the MIXI Bid was scheduled to close four weeks later and therefore there was
no time pressure on PointsBet shareholders to accept
the MIXI Bid prior to the
betr Bid opening and
(d) in fact it was likely that many PointsBet shareholders, aware of the
competing offers for some time now, would wait to see what
unfolded, and
potentially benefit from improved disclosure, prior to making any final
decisions with regards to the MIXI Bid or the
President also had regard to the important principle in the Panel’s policy
that, in general, the Panel will not hold up
a transaction by interim orders and
prefers to allow a bidder’s statement to be dispatched pending a final
decision on the
deficiencies.
However here, on
balance and for the reasons set out above, the President decided to make an
interim order to restrain the dispatch
of the betr Bidder’s Statement (see
Annexure A).
Subsequent events
30 July 2025, betr announced that it intended to increase its all-scrip offer
(once opened) to 4.219 betr shares for every 1 PointsBet
share held. Among
other things, betr stated that:
(a) the increased offer consideration equated to $1.35 per PointsBet share based
on the betr Capital Raising price of $0.32, $1.35
per PointsBet share based on
the most recent closing price of betr shares and $1.33 per PointsBet share based
on the 2-day VWAP of
betr shares
The improved offer is superior to MIXI’s offer of $1.20 cash
per PointsBet Share
betr expects that the PointsBet Board will reconsider its
recommendation that PointsBet shareholders accept the MIXI Offer and will
recommend the betr Offer.
31 July 2025, PointsBet announced (among other things) that “
PointsBet Board has determined, with the assistance of external advisers, that
the Betr Proposal is materially inferior to the
MIXI Takeover Offer, even taking
into account the Proposed Variation
Decision to conduct proceedings
have considered all the material and address specifically only that part of the
material we consider necessary to explain our reasoning.
made a preliminary submission in which it submitted that we should decline to
conduct proceedings for the following reasons:
(a) betr was prepared to provide an undertaking to
release a replacement bidder’s statement in the form of the First Proposed
RBS accompanying its preliminary submission, which it submitted addressed
substantially all of the disclosure matters raised in the
application
(b) the Selective Share Buy-Back did not offend the equality principle or breach
section 623 and did not give rise to unacceptable
circumstances and
(c) the announcement of the Selective Share Buy-Back and the release of the
Buy-Back Notice of Meeting had not had, and was not expected
discernible impact on the market price of betr shares given no existing betr
shares could be sold via the Selective Share
considered that the betr Bid presented significant intertwined structural and
disclosure issues which were, in our view, critical
to PointsBet shareholders
considering the all-scrip betr Bid including comparing it to the all-cash MIXI
Bid. We were not satisfied
that the First Proposed RBS addressed these issues
adequately and accordingly did not consider it appropriate to lift the
President’s
interim order.
In our view, this was unlikely to be detrimental to betr given the commercial
status of the betr Bid.
The implied value of the consideration offered under the
asked the parties whether the First Proposed RBS addressed the concerns raised
in the application in relation to the disclosure
of the implied value of the
submitted that, given developments that had occurred since the betr Capital
Raising, using the same price of $0.32 per betr
share was inappropriate and
misleading, and instead of using the stale price of $0.32, betr should have used
the betr share price
at the most recent practicable date.
also submitted that betr continuing to adopt the same value for a betr share
despite the change to the exchange ratio (announced
was flawed. It submitted
that betr increasing the offer ratio, where the value of the combined entity
remained unchanged, meant
that the fundamental value of a pre-existing betr
share would fall given its entitlement to an interest in the combined entity
diminished.
PointsBet submitted that this was particularly relevant because the
betr Bid was a reverse takeover so that PointsBet’s shareholders’
potential ownership in the combined entity would be significant.
also submitted that the Selective Share Buy-Back would compound these issues as
buying back shares (at $0.32) above their
current market price would be value
destructive.
submitted that, given the betr Capital Raising had been conducted for the
purpose of funding an acquisition of PointsBet and
constituted a significant
price discovery exercise, the price at which the betr Capital Raising was
conducted was an appropriate
measure of the value of betr’s shares.
submitted that, in any event, in the First Proposed RBS on each occasion that
there was a reference to a value of a betr share
under the betr Bid, betr had
given equal prominence to the capital raising price of $0.32, the most recent
closing price and the
30-, 60- and 90-day VWAPs for betr shares, which addressed
the concerns raised in the application.
Note 18 states that:
In a cash bid, the share
price of the target will change with the market’s view of the bid (or
potential bid), including the
likelihood of the bid succeeding and the bid
consideration being increased. In a scrip bid, these factors affect also the
share price. It is therefore important, if comparing the bid
consideration to the target’s share price or value, to do so in
will not mislead or confuse offeree shareholders.
Note 18 also states that unacceptable circumstances may arise
(a) the prices at the most recent practicable date are not included (including
the date just before the date of the bidder’s
statement or target’s
statement or, if the bidder’s statement or target’s statement is
subsequently amended, just
before printing)
(b) there is not a clear explanation of the reason for selecting the particular
date for the comparison
(c) the comparison is not like-for-like and the method used to calculate it, if
not the most reasonable, is not adequately explained
(d) statements as to value are included without a reasonable basis for them
being disclosed.
our view, $0.32 was likely a stale price for betr shares under the betr Bid.
However, we considered that the disclosure in the
First Proposed RBS, with a
range of implied values calibrated over different betr shares prices,
sufficiently addressed our concerns.
We also considered that, to the extent
there were residual issues, PointsBet could address these in its target’s
Misleading disclosure and expected synergies
submitted that the betr Bidder’s Statement contained material information
deficiencies, including in relation to the
synergies which betr relied upon in
valuing the consideration under the betr Bid, which “
contain material
errors and are presented in a misleading, incomplete and unbalanced
”. In support of this, PointsBet submitted (among other things)
(a) the valuation of the betr Bid was based on the assumption that the synergies
set out in the betr Bidder’s Statement were
realised in full, which
PointsBet submitted was unlikely given the fact that the betr Bid was not
subject to a minimum acceptance
condition and that MIXI Australia already held a
14.98% interest in PointsBet at the time of the application, increased to 28.2%
at the time of submissions in response to our brief
(b) betr made an “
arithmetic error in its calculation and has double
counted Betr’s 66m PointsBet shares
” because “
PointsBet’s equity value at $0.83 has been shown alongside 100% of
Betr’s equity value at $0.32 (calculated as
$0.32 x Betr’s shares on
issue), but Betr owns 19.6% of PointsBet and the value of this stake is
reflected within Betr’s
equity value
(c) there was no reasonable basis for betr to represent in the betr
Bidder’s Statement that the illustrative value of the betr
Bid was $1.89,
consisting of $1.22 in scrip consideration and $0.67 for PointsBet
shareholders’ share of capitalised synergies
(i) betr’s arithmetic error described above and
(ii) betr referred to a synergy analysis undertaken by an accounting firm in a
different context (betr’s proposed acquisition
of PointsBet via a scheme
of arrangement) and which assumed the divestment of PointsBet’s Canadian
business, noting that if
betr did assume the divestment of PointsBet’s
Canadian business, then PointsBet submitted that:
divestment was hypothetical and the betr Bid was not conditional on that sale
analysis contained no adjustments in respect of the sale of the Canadian
business and
(C) there was no
disclosure with regards to this assumption.
also submitted that the total value of the synergies expected by betr being 1.6x
the value of PointsBet as a whole was “
plainly not credible
and that the 8-10x multiple used to calculated the capitalised value of the
expected synergies was high compared to the “
only one other ASX-listed
betting company, Tabcorp, and this company trades at approximately 6.3x FY26
submitted that betr should instead set out the value of the betr Bid reflecting
shorter term and longer term share prices
and specify the synergy value based on
cascading scenarios of shareholding.
Australia made submissions that substantially supported all of the points raised
by PointsBet. MIXI Australia also submitted
that the alleged disclosure
deficiencies had impeded “
PointsBet shareholders’ ability to
assess the relative merits of the [betr] Offer and the MIXI Offer
submitted that it believed it had a reasonable basis for its synergy estimates
PointsBet’s claim of double counting or an arithmetic
error in the calculation of the per share synergy value accruing to PointsBet
Shareholders is wrong and reflects a difference in valuation methodology which
betr considers is in line with market standard
.” betr also submitted
that the First Proposed RBS set out the basis for the estimates and contained
amendments to address
the issues raised by PointsBet. In particular, the First
Proposed RBS (among other things):
(a) contained disclosure on the assumptions underlying the expected synergies,
including that these were based on betr acquiring
100% of PointsBet shares and
“[t]here can be no guarantee that Successful Offer Completion will
occur, especially where MIXI has a Relevant Interest in 66.0
million PointsBet
Shares as at the Last
Practicable Date
(b) provided details around betr’s assumption that PointsBet’s
Canadian operations would be divested
(c) no longer contained a single value point (i.e. the reference to $0.67 per
PointsBet share) to represent PointsBet shareholders’
share of capitalised
synergies. Instead, betr revisited its value impact analysis and included
(among other things):
(i) statements to the effect that synergies were expected to “
material incremental value
” if betr acquired 100% of PointsBet shares
but would be limited in scope and quantum otherwise
(ii) disclosure that the analysis was “
highly theoretical and Synergy
value should not be considered fully cumulative to PointsBet Shareholders to the
implied Offer value
” and that any agreement between betr and PointsBet
that was required to realise the expected synergies “
may involve
detailed negotiations between betr and the independent directors of PointsBet
and may be subject to approval (including
under the ASX Listing Rules) of
non-associated PointsBet Shareholders
(iii) a table setting out the potential synergy
value per PointsBet share, sensitised by expected cost synergies realised and
capitalisation
also submitted that it was not unreasonable for it to capture a scenario where
betr would acquire 100% of PointsBet shares, given
it still remained open for
MIXI Australia to accept the betr Bid noting that MIXI Australia had not (up to
that point) made any public
statement to the effect that it would not be
accepting the betr Bid. betr also submitted that “
bidder’s statement includes numerous disclosures that contemplate it
reaching 100% ownership of PointsBet... PointsBet
seemingly had no concerns with
these disclosures notwithstanding betr holding 19.6% of PointsBet’s
shares. On PointsBet’s
logic, these disclosures ought to be removed from
MIXI’s bidder's statement.
submitted that any remaining issues PointsBet may have could be addressed in its
target’s statement.
initially agreed with PointsBet that the level of disclosure in betr’s
Bidder’s Statement was unsatisfactory with regards
to the expected
synergies. However, we considered that the changes made in the First Proposed
RBS addressed most of our concerns.
We requested that the figures listed in the
table setting out the potential synergy value per PointsBet share (as described
in paragraph
) all be in the
same format (i.e. no bold), so that the analysis was presented in neutral terms.
betr agreed to amend it accordingly.
consider that both PointsBet and betr put forward valid, albeit diverging,
arguments with regards to the expected synergies under
the betr Bid. We were
satisfied with betr’s revised level of disclosure. To the extent
PointsBet disagreed with betr’s
analysis of the expected synergies, which
was unsurprising in the context of an unsolicited takeover offer, we consider
that PointsBet
could raise these points in its target’s statement.
Selective Share Buy-Back
Collateral benefit
section 623(1), a bidder must not, during the offer period for a takeover bid,
offer to give a benefit to a person if:
(a) the benefit is likely to induce the person or an associate to accept an
offer under the bid (or dispose of securities in the
bid class) and
(b) the benefit is not offered to all shareholders.
submitted that “
[d]espite it being proposed as a clear inducement to
encourage acceptance of the betr Bid, betr has not offered PointsBet
shareholders
the benefit of this cash option as part of or under the betr Bid.
As such, the [Selective Share Buy-Back] contravenes the prohibition
collateral benefits in
section 623
Corporations Act
also submitted that the Selective Share Buy-Back offended the equality of
benefits principle given PointsBet shareholders
who accepted the betr Bid and
subsequently sold their betr shares acquired under the bid would not be eligible
to participate in
the Selective Share Buy-Back. PointsBet referred to the
provision that provides, in a takeover bid, that if a bidder varies its
increase the consideration, whether by increasing the scrip ratio or by
providing additional cash consideration, then all
shareholders who have accepted
the bid are entitled to receive the improved
consideration.
It submitted
that this principle ensures that shareholders are not disadvantaged by the
timing of their acceptance or subsequent
dealings in the securities. It
submitted that the structure of the Selective Share Buy-Back deviates from this
principle, results
in unequal treatment between shareholders who have sold their
betr shares and those who have retained them, and this would not be
the case if
the cash alternative was provided as part of the betr Bid.
submitted that the Selective Share Buy-Back was not a collateral benefit,
(a) the offers under the Selective Share Buy-Back would only be made after the
end of the offer period under the betr Bid and therefore
section 623
(b) under the Selective Share Buy-Back, betr shares would be bought back at
$0.32 which was the fair market value of a betr share
(c) the Selective Share Buy-Back would be available to all PointsBet
shareholders who accepted the betr Bid and at the same time,
with any excess
applications being scaled back pro rata.
relation to the equality of benefits principle, betr noted that the definition
of ‘Eligible Buy-Back Shareholders’
in the Second Proposed RBS
excluded certain former PointsBet shareholders from participating in the
Selective Share Buy-Back but
that this did not offend the equality of benefits
principle. betr submitted that there was clear disclosure in the Second
RBS that voting already held shares in betr in favour of the Buy-Back
Resolution would disentitle that shareholder from participating
in the Selective
Share Buy-Back, which was consistent with
section 257D.
Any shareholders
excluded from participating in the Selective Share Buy-Back would be the result
of them ‘opting out’
by voting in favour of the Buy-Back Resolution.
in relation to PointsBet’s submission at paragraph
, betr submitted that there was no
equality of opportunity issue where shareholders are unable to sell their shares
under the Selective
Share Buy-Back because they have already sold those shares
prior. betr submitted that these shareholders have knowingly given up
right to participate in the Selective Share Buy-Back.
further submitted that at this stage it was not aware of any PointsBet
shareholders that would be excluded from participation
in the Selective Share
Buy-Back as a result of ASX Listing Rules 10.1, noting that “
person of whom betr is aware that could become a “substantial”
(10%+) shareholder in betr at the time the Selective
Buy-Back is conducted is
MIXI if it were to accept the betr offer... as would result in it holding
>10% of all betr shares at
the time of the Selective Buy-Back.
betr submitted that it would be prepared to seek a waiver from ASX to permit
MIXI Australia to participate in the Selective
Share Buy-Back or if such waiver
was not granted, to seek the approval of betr’s shareholders for the same.
considering the effect of the Selective Share Buy-Back and the betr bid, we
looked at the substance and commerciality of the transactions
, not just their legal
our view, the Selective Share Buy-Back was commercially integrated with the betr
Bid. This had critical implications in terms
of disclosure (discussed below)
and Chapter 6 principles.
were minded to view the Selective Share Buy-Back as an inducement for PointsBet
shareholders to accept the betr Bid by perceiving
the Selective Share Buy-Back
as a short-term liquidity option equivalent to a cash election when in fact it
was, by its very nature,
conditional on shareholder approval and
‘selective’.
on balance, we considered that the Selective Share Buy-Back, while complex and
novel in the context of an all-scrip takeover
bid (including one that is
competing with an all-cash takeover bid), was not unacceptable and potentially
pro-competitive to the
extent that:
(a) the structural and sequencing issues around the
expected timetable of the betr Bid and the Selective Share Buy-Back respectively
were appropriately addressed and that betr shareholders consider the Share
Consideration Resolution and the Buy-Back Resolution at
the same meeting
(b) there was adequate disclosure in betr’s
replacement bidder’s statement of the rationale for the Selective Share
how it was intended to operate (including eligibility, voting, funding
and scale back), its terms and conditions, its compliance
with the requirements
of Chapter 2J (and ASIC guidance) and its risks and uncertainties for PointsBet
shareholders who were considering
accepting the betr Bid and
(c) no PointsBet shareholder who accepted the betr
Bid would be excluded from participating in the Selective Share Buy-Back (unless
they ‘opted out’ by voting their betr shares in favour of the
Buy-Back Resolution).
issues raised in paragraphs
are separately addressed below.
relation to the issue raised in paragraph
, betr offered an undertaking that it
(a) use its best efforts to obtain a waiver from ASX allowing MIXI Australia (if
it accepted the betr Bid and then so elected) to
participate in the Selective
Share Buy-Back and
(b) in the event betr did not obtain such waiver, betr would seek shareholder
approval in relation to MIXI Australia’s eligibility
to participate in the
Selective Share Buy-Back at the general meeting convened by betr to consider the
Share Consideration Resolution
and the Buy-Back Resolution.
accepted betr’s submission that no other PointsBet shareholders accepting
the betr Bid would be excluded from participating
in the Selective Share
Buy-Back and as a result the equality principle in section 602 was not
betr’s undertaking sufficiently addressed our concerns with regards to the
equality of benefits principle and section
Structural issues and shareholder approvals
the First Proposed RBS, it was noted that the betr Bid was proposed to close on
1 September 2025 and the meeting to consider the
Buy-Back Resolution was
scheduled to be held on 25 August 2025. No details on timing were disclosed in
relation to the meeting to
consider the Share Consideration Resolution.
submitted that betr should seek shareholder approval for the Share Consideration
Resolution and the Buy-Back Resolution
at the same meeting, particularly given
the Selective Share Buy-Back was conditional on the approval of the Share
Consideration Resolution
and the relevant betr shares being issued. PointsBet
also submitted that “
[t]he current approach, which involves splitting
the resolutions across separate meetings and attempting to deal with overlapping
and closely related disclosure issues across multiple documents
inconsistent with clear, concise and effective disclosure “
particularly
given that the [Selective Share Buy-Back] is clearly an integral feature of the
Australia submitted that it was unclear in the First Proposed RBS that the betr
bid was not conditional on the Selective Share
Buy-Back being approved and that
both resolutions should be put to the same meeting, and that the timetable and
timing implications
should be “
fully and prominently
” in betr’s replacement bidder’s statement.
submitted that the Buy-Back Notice of Meeting was able to be dispatched earlier
than the notice of meeting for the issue of shares
under the betr Bid, the
latter requiring ASX review under the ASX Listing Rules. betr submitted that
this sequencing was in the
best interests of PointsBet and betr shareholders as
it would remove significant uncertainty around the Selective Share Buy-Back
(given the higher voting threshold on the Buy-Back Resolution of 75%) in the
context of the betr Bid. Notwithstanding this, betr
confirmed it was willing to
defer the meeting to consider the Buy-Back Resolution so that it could be voted
on at the same meeting
as the Share Consideration Resolution.
we were of the view that the Selective Share Buy-Back was commercially
integrated with the betr Bid rather than a standalone
capital management
initiative, we considered that the Buy-Back Resolution should be considered at
the same meeting as the Share Consideration
Resolution. This would ensure that
betr shareholders were able to assess the overall value proposition of the two
integrated transactions
being proposed by betr (namely, the betr Bid and the
Selective Share Buy-Back) and make a fully informed voting decision.
offered an undertaking to:
(a) further revise the Second Proposed RBS to include a combined expected
timetable of the betr Bid, the Share Consideration Resolution
and the Buy-Back
(b) withdraw the Buy-Back Notice of Meeting, cancel that meeting and disregard
all voting directions provided and
(c) issue a replacement notice of meeting and explanatory memorandum for a new
meeting of betr shareholders convened to consider
the Buy-Back Resolution and
the Share Consideration Resolution.
were satisfied that betr’s undertaking with regards to the sequencing of
the shareholder resolutions would ensure that PointsBet
shareholders would be
considering the betr Bid in an efficient, competitive and informed market.
submitted that the Selective Share Buy-Back was unacceptable because it was
contrary to the policy of Chapter 6. It submitted
that it was unclear how the
Selective Share Buy-Back would operate and as such that Pointsbet shareholders
did not have adequate
information to assess the merits of selling their shares
into the betr Bid and then potentially tendering the betr shares they received
into the Selective Share Buy-Back, contrary to an efficient competitive and
informed market. PointsBet also submitted that “
betr has created the
highly misleading impression that PointsBet shareholders will have access to a
cash alternative, whereas in fact
the SBB might not proceed at all, and the betr
Bid may proceed without it
our view, the disclosure in the First Proposed RBS in relation to the Selective
Share Buy-Back was inadequate and may have led
to unacceptable circumstances, in
particular in relation to incomplete disclosure on the following
(a) the rationale for the Selective Share Buy-Back
(b) how it was intended to operate (including eligibility, voting, funding,
process and scale back)
(c) how the scale back would operate, with a lack of worked examples showing
different levels of participation in the Selective Share
Buy-Back and the likely
impact of any scale back in each case
(d) its terms and conditions
(e) its compliance with the requirements of Chapter 2J (and ASIC guidance) and
(f) its risks and uncertainties for PointsBet shareholders who were considering
accepting the betr Bid.
response to our brief, betr submitted that it had addressed these issues in the
Second Proposed RBS.
Australia submitted that the disclosure in the Second Proposed RBS was
inadequate and that betr’s replacement bidder’s
statement should
contain clear and prominent disclosure of the fact that the Selective
Buy-Back is a separate transaction to the Offer, that its size,
price and timing
all remain subject to betr's discretion and will not be confirmed until after
the end of the Offer Period, and that
certain shareholders may be excluded from
participating in the Selective Buy-Back.
provided an undertaking that it would further revise the Second Proposed RBS to
include disclosure, including in the Chairman’s
Letter, the Frequently
Asked Questions and the section on the Selective Share Buy-Back, in relation to
the fact that PointsBet shareholders
accepting the betr Bid, despite being
eligible to participate in the Selective Share Buy-Back and despite betr
shareholders approving
the Selective Share Buy-Back, may only have some, but not
all, of their betr shares bought back under the Selective Share Buy-Back.
also undertook not to disclose or dispatch a replacement bidder’s
statement until it was in a form that we did not object
to. betr also amended
the Second Proposed RBS to confirm that the price under the Selective Share
Buy-Back would be fixed at $0.32
per share (and would not be reduced even if the
all-scrip offer was subsequently increased).
Selective Share Buy-Back appeared inherently uncertain as to whether it would
proceed at all (given the need for separate betr
shareholder approval), as to
the availability of funding at different levels of participation and the extent
to which any scale-back
may apply. However, to the extent that that uncertainty
was adequately disclosed in betr’s replacement bidder’s statement,
we are not satisfied that the uncertainty (and associated complexities) would
have adverse commercial consequences which affected
the efficiency of the market
for PointsBet shares contrary to section 602. In fact we concluded
(a) the structure could be attractive to some PointsBet shareholders who were
willing to take a three-step approach to potentially
receiving cash proceeds
from betr that were higher than the $1.20 cash offered under the MIXI Bid (i.e.
accept the betr Bid (Step
1), receive betr shares in exchange (Step 2) and then
tender those betr shares into the Selective Share Buy-Back to receive $0.32
per betr share, assuming it proceeds (Step 3)) and
(b) the structure had the potential to enhance the existing competitive auction
between MIXI and betr, and in this regard we note
that on 21 August 2025 MIXI
Australia announced on a last and final basis an increase in its offer price
from $1.20 to $1.30 per
PointsBet share (if MIXI Australia acquired 90% or more
of PointsBet shares) or $1.25 per PointsBet Share (if MIXI Australia acquired
less than 90%) and that on 27 August 2025 betr announced that it would increase
its all-scrip offer from 4.219 betr shares for every
PointsBet share to 4.375
betr shares for every PointsBet share.
Regulatory Guide 110: Share buy-backs provides that “
[i]f a company
proposes to buy back a significant percentage of shares or the holdings of a
major shareholder, it should consider
providing...a report by its independent
directors about whether shareholders should vote in favour of the buy-back,
particularly
regarding how much the company is paying for the shares; and... an
independent expert’s report with a valuation of the shares
asked betr whether it was proposing to obtain an independent expert’s
report to support the price of $0.32 per betr share
under the Selective Share
confirmed and submitted that “
[a] copy of the independent
expert’s report will be in [sic] provided to betr shareholders in advance
of the meeting or meetings
to approve the issue of shares under the Offer and
the Selective Buy-Back
submitted that “
shareholders should be told that they have not been
provided with all material information, that they can expect to receive further
disclosure including an IER, and that they will have the opportunity to alter
their proxy votes or voting intention statements. betr
should also promptly
indicate the expected timeframe since these reports usually require some time to
complete and, as noted above,
all be provided together
Australia submitted that betr shareholders and the market should have the
benefit of the 28 days’ notice period to consider
the independent
expert’s report prior to the meeting to consider the Selective Share
Buy-Back, at which the Share Consideration
Resolution should also be considered.
provided an undertaking that at least 28 days before the general meeting at
which the Buy-Back Resolution and the Share Consideration
Resolution were to be
considered, it would issue a replacement notice of meeting and explanatory
memorandum, to be accompanied by:
(a) an independent expert’s report in relation to the Selective Share
Buy-Back, which would include a valuation of the shares
to be bought back in
compliance with ASIC Regulatory Guide 110.18 and
(b) if betr was unable to obtain a waiver from ASX so that MIXI Australia could
(if it accepted the betr Bid) participate in the
Selective Share Buy-Back, an
additional resolution to permit MIXI Australia to participate the Selective
Share Buy-Back.
considered that betr shareholders and the market should be able to withdraw
their acceptances once fully informed after the replacement
notice of meeting,
explanatory memorandum and independent expert’s report(s) were available
on ASX. We also considered that
betr should not process acceptances under the
betr Bid until then.
provided an undertaking that it would either offer withdrawal rights (subject to
obtaining ASIC relief to permit it to do so)
until five business days after the
release of the replacement notice of meeting, explanatory memorandum and
independent expert’s
report or it would not open the betr Bid until that
same time. betr also undertook not to process any acceptances under the betr
Bid until the end of the period that shareholders could withdraw acceptance.
6 requires a control transaction to be exposed to competition in an informed
market, as a means of allowing the market to
assess the adequacy of the
we were satisfied that PointsBet shareholders and the market generally would be
informed and not coerced, so as to properly
assess the adequacy of the betr Bid
and its commercially integrated Selective Share Buy-Back. On that basis, we did
not consider
the substantially amended disclosure around the Selective Share
Buy-Back to be unacceptable. We also recognised that a selective
buy-back is a permitted corporate action and that, subject to compliance with
the applicable disclosure and regulatory requirements,
betr should not be
restricted from undertaking the Selective Share Buy-Back.
Minimum Bid Price Rule
submitted that:
(a) in April 2025, betr had bought PointsBet shares at $1.10 per share,
therefore betr’s share price needed to be at least
$0.29 ($1.10/3.81x) in
order to meet the minimum bid price rule
(b) measured on a rolling two-day VWAP, the betr share price was below $0.29 for
the entire period between the announcement of the
betr Bid on 20 June 2025 to
the final trading day prior to lodgement of the betr Bidder’s Statement on
16 July 2025 and therefore
betr had been “
reckless in announcing a bid
that had a real chance of not complying with the Minimum Bid Price
” in light of ASIC
[t]he only days available for Betr to value the [betr Bid] for the
purposes of the Minimum Bid Price Rule were 24 July 2025 and 25
” and, given the release of the Buy-Back Notice of Meeting on 24
July 2025 had had a positive impact on betr’s share price
because underlying betr investors who had lent out their shares were instructing
their broker to recall their lent shares
in order to be able to vote on the
Buy-Back Resolution), the release of the Buy-Back Notice of Meeting was
mechanism to support
Betr’s share price and ensure that Betr’s market VWAP over 24 July
and 25 July 2025 is above $0.29,
thereby ensuring that the BBT Offer satisfies
the Minimum Bid Price Rule
621(3) states that:
The consideration offered for securities in
the bid class under a takeover bid must equal or exceed the maximum
consideration that
the bidder or an associate provided, or agreed to provide,
for a security in the bid class under any purchase or agreement during
months before the date of the bid.
Regulatory Guide 9 states at RG 9.185
Instrument 2015/1068 modifies the operation of the minimum bid price rule to
allow a bidder to value quoted securities that it
offers as bid consideration up
to five business days before it sends its first offer. The value must be
determined using the volumed
weighted average market price of the quoted
securities in the ordinary course of trading during the two full trading days
a time chosen by the bidder (chosen valuation time) provided that:
(a) the chosen valuation time is within the five business days before the
date the first offer is sent under the bid—this is
to ensure the valuation
time is as close as practicable to the date of the bid; and
(b) the period of trading on which the valuation is based does not start
until at least five trading days have elapsed after the date
the bidder sent a
copy of the bidder’s statement to the target and each approved financial
market on which the securities are
quoted—this is to ensure that there is
time for the market price to reflect the impact of the takeover bid.
asked the parties whether the increased bid consideration announced by betr on
addressed the
concerns raised in PointsBet’s application in relation to the minimum bid
price rule.
submitted that the Selective Share Buy-Back had been first announced
over a month prior to any potential minimum bid pricing
” and that neither the announcement of the Selective Share
Buy-Back nor the release of the Buy-Back Notice of Meeting had any
discernible
impact on the market price of betr shares given no shares currently traded were
eligible to be sold into the Selective
Share Buy-Back. betr also submitted that
following the increased [sic] in the betr Bid on 30 July, the implied
value of the betr Bid based on the 2-day VWAP for betr shares
has been above the
minimum bid price at all the times identified by PointsBet in their Application,
other than 10, 14 and 15 July
submitted that “
it is important that the market is fully informed,
including as to the likely impact of an increased exchange ratio, at the time
minimum bid price is calculated
” in particular in the context of a
reverse takeover (noting the potential adverse effect on betr’s share
price of the
increased dilution). PointsBet submitted that given the increased
consideration under the betr Bid, “
betr should be permitted to value
its bid as per RG9.185 for the purposes of the minimum bid price rule, but only
as if the references
in ASIC Corporations (Minimum Bid Price) Instrument
2015/1068 to “bidder’s statement” are read as
“replacement
bidder’s statement”
Panel does not take a technical approach when considering whether unacceptable
circumstances exist with regards to section 621
and the policy of section
note that the Selective Share Buy-Back was first announced by betr on 20 June
2025, at the same time as the betr Bid, so that the
market was trading on an
informed basis prior to the release of the Buy-Back Notice of Meeting. We
consider that PointsBet did not
provide a sufficient body of material to justify
its claims that the release of the Buy-Back Notice of Meeting, over a month
was a mechanism to support betr’s share price.
any event, given betr’s submission that, further to the increased
consideration under the betr Bid, the implied value of
the betr Bid had been
above the minimum bid price at all times (but for three days) since 20 June
2025, we are not satisfied that
the equality principle, on which the minimum bid
price rule is based, was offended. We consider that any residual issues around
the implied value of the betr Bid could be addressed by PointsBet in its
target’s statement.
Association
submitted that betr’s chairman, Mr Matthew Tripp, and his parents Mrs
Catherine Tripp and Mr Alan Tripp, were associated
in relation to the affairs of
betr, that they had voting power that included the shares held by two
substantial holders in betr,
YAST and Majestic, resulting in
undisclosed voting power of 19.4% in betr
”. In support of
its association claim, PointsBet submitted (among other things) that:
the Tripp Family have a history of making joint decisions in
relation to betting businesses in which one or more of them has an
(b) there were structural links between Majestic (an entity controlled by Mrs
Catherine Tripp) and YAST (an entity controlled by
Mr Matthew Tripp, as
disclosed in the betr Bidder’s Statement)
Alan has been a director of a company associated with Matthew
(BetEasy) and in which Majestic Equity had a shareholding at the time,
indicating Majestic Equity is closely connected with Alan
(d) Mr Alan Tripp had been actively involved in business operations carried out
by Mr Matthew Tripp and Mrs Catherine Tripp, with
his participation limited only
due to regulatory restrictions applying as a result of past convictions.
submitted that “
PointsBet shareholders do not know the true extent of
the holding of the controller of Betr (and thus do not understand the Tripp
Family’s influence over Betr)
” and that the
properly disclose the voting power of Mr Matthew Tripp, Mrs Catherine Tripp and
Mr Alan Tripp was contrary to an efficient,
competitive and informed market
(section 602(a)) and did not give sufficient information to enable PointsBet
shareholders to assess
the merits of the betr Bid (contrary to section 602(b)).
our preliminary view, at a minimum the betr Bidder’s Statement should have
disclosed the combined voting power that Mr Matthew
Tripp, Mrs Catherine Tripp
and Mr Alan Tripp would have in betr if the betr Bid was successful, including
with regards to the impact
of the Selective Share Buy-Back on major
shareholders.
submitted that the disclosure of the combined interest was necessary but not
sufficient given it did not address:
(a) betr’s past non-compliance with section 606 and section 671B which led
to an uninformed market for betr shares at the time
the betr Bid was
(b) issues relating to the betr Capital Raising and the fact that
[t]here is a high risk that betr's cleansing notice was
” given betr had “
failed to accurately disclose the
aggregate voting power and relevant relationships of the Tripp Family
in this document, which could have a material impact on the ability of PointsBet
shareholders to receive and sell betr shares
under the betr Bid due to potential
breaches of on-sale restrictions under section 727(1)
(c) the risk posed to PointsBet’s existing licensing and approvals, noting
“if incorrect disclosure has been made to regulators, betr may be
prohibited from any ownership interest in PointsBet and/or
places the PointsBet
business operations at serious risk of fines, temporary closures or loss of
licensure which would negatively
impact PointsBet and its
shareholders
Matthew Tripp refuted the association claim made by PointsBet. He submitted
that there was no common directorship between Majestic
and YAST and that
[t]he fact the entities use the same registered address and contact
address, and were incorporated in the same year, are matters of
administrative
convenience rather than evidence that one is responsible for the administration
of the holdings of the other.
” Mr Matthew Tripp also submitted that
while he and his mother had both invested in betr (and other betting businesses)
that his father had consulted him and his mother in respect of one
transaction, these family links “
are insufficient to infer of a history
and pattern of joint decision-making, or that they are otherwise associates in
relation to
Catherine Tripp and Mr Alan Tripp made submissions to the same effect, including
that the application relied on “
a patchwork of commercial
relationships, historical dealings and choice of administrative service
providers but fails to provide any
substantive evidence of an agreement,
arrangement, or understanding to act in concert in relation to the affairs of
betr or PointsBet.
” Mrs Catherine Tripp and Mr Alan Tripp also
submitted that Majestic’s involvement in betr had always been one of
investment, as illustrated by the fact that Majestic did not participate
in a placement in July 2024 and in the betr Capital Raising
when, in both
instances, YAST did.
also submitted that notwithstanding the fact that both YAST and Majestic Equity
had advised betr that they were not associates,
betr was prepared to amend its
bidder’s statement to show the holdings of YAST and Majestic Equity in the
relevant substantial
holding tables individually and on an aggregated
our preliminary view, a serious question was raised about whether Mr Matthew
Tripp, as a result of the family connections, history
of involvement and common
dealings, was an associate of his parents Mrs Catherine Tripp and Mr Alan Tripp
in relation to betr.
on balance and in light of the Panel’s objective to decide disputes in
relation to takeovers in a speedy manner by
focusing on the commercial issues at
play, we decided not to investigate this issue further. We had regard to the
fact that PointsBet’s
application “
relates to Betr’s
all-scrip off-market takeover offer for all of the issued share capital in
”. We consider that, in the context of the betr Bid, the
additional disclosure in betr’s proposed replacement bidder’s
statement with regards to the combined interest of Mr Matthew Tripp, Mrs
Catherine Tripp and Mr Alan Tripp sufficiently addressed
the claims raised by
PointsBet so that the circumstances were not unacceptable in relation to the
affairs of PointsBet.
were also concerned about any gaming and wagering regulatory implications that
any finding of an undisclosed association between
Mr Matthew Tripp and his
parents might have on PointsBet shareholders under the betr Bid. Given our
decision not to investigate
the alleged association further, we consider that
this is a risk that PointsBet could raise in its target’s statement.
the substantial corrective disclosures and undertakings offered by betr, we
declined to make a declaration and are satisfied
that it is not against the
public interest to do so. We had regard to the matters in s657A(3).
that we made no declaration of unacceptable circumstances, we make no final
orders, including as to costs.
22 August 2025, betr convened a shareholder meeting to approve, among other
matters, MIXI Australia’s participation in the
Selective Share Buy-Back in
accordance with paragraph 8 of its
undertaking.
25 August 2025, MIXI Australia released a supplementary bidder’s statement
disclosing (among other things) that “
MIXI Australia has now determined
that it will not accept the all-scrip offer from betr for PointsBet shares as
set out in betr's
Replacement Bidder’s Statement dated 18 August 2025
(“betr's Offer”) nor any subsequent improvement in betr's Offer
applicable).
1 September 2025, betr sought our consent to vary its undertaking so that it
could withdraw the resolution seeking betr shareholder
approval of MIXI
Australia’s participation in the Selective Share Buy-Back. betr submitted
that, given MIXI Australia’s
statement with regards to the betr Offer,
there is no circumstance in which MIXI could participate in the
Selective Buy-Back
” and that “
proceeding with this resolution
notwithstanding MIXI’s commitment not to accept the betr Offer creates an
impression that MIXI
is still free to accept the betr Offer and risks confusing
PointsBet shareholders, betr Shareholders and the market generally
201A(2) of the
ASIC Act 2001
(Cth) provides that a person may vary an
undertaking at any time, but only with the consent of the Panel.
invited parties to make submissions and, after considering these, we consented
on 8 September 2025 to betr’s request to vary
its undertaking (see
