INTRODUCTION
1 The applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 29
June 2012. She made application for the payment of a disability allowance;
was refused by the Motor Accidents Insurance Board (“Board”) and she
referred that decision on appeal to the Tribunal
by referral in August 2014
(“first referral”). The first referral was dismissed by order of
the Tribunal on 13 November
2015. The applicant thereupon made a further
referral (“second referral”) to the Tribunal seeking to review the
of the Board not to pay a disability allowance. This referral was, by
notice of hearing to the parties dated 29 April 2016, listed
for hearing on 19
and 20 May 2016. On 12 May 2016, the solicitor for the applicant gave notice
that an application for an adjournment
was to be made, this was heard on 16 May
2016. The application was opposed by the Board.
DETERMINATION
2 This claim by the applicant has been before the Tribunal now
for some 20 months. The first referral continued for an extended period
in the face of a challenge made at an early stage by the Board that the referral
had been made out of time. Eventually that
referral was dismissed on the
challenge to jurisdiction. The second referral was immediately made and no
doubt, based upon expert
and other evidence having been gathered for the first
referral, the solicitor for the applicant advised at a teleconference on 18
December 2015 that the matter ought to be listed for hearing. This was
supported by the Board and the Tribunal advised a listing
would be made as soon
as possible. Unfortunately there was then some delay due to the unavailability
for a period of time of counsel
for the respondent and also pressures upon the
available time of the sole Tribunal Member.
3 Following the listing for
hearing, counsel for the applicant sought an adjournment on the basis
• Notice of hearing was received on 2 May 2016 for a
hearing on 19/20 May 2016;
• The preference was for Dr Rowe to give
evidence in person rather than by video conference, but that could not be
for the hearing dates;
• Dr Haynes was not
• Dr Parks was believed to be unwell and unlikely to be
available at all to give evidence. An alternate medical assessment
therefore be required;
• The applicant wishes to be assessed by a
psychiatrist, and it may be that her mental health status may be relevant to
4 Counsel for the Board, in opposing the application,
highlighted:
• The applicant represented in December 2015 that this
matter was ready for hearing;
• No issue as to expert witness
availability had been raised previously;
• The issue as to the mental
health of the applicant had not been raised previously in these proceedings or
in the first referral;
• The Board is prejudiced and an order for costs
in favour of the Board in the first referral remains unresolved with no offer
made by the applicant in that regard;
• An adjournment will add to the
delay in determining this matter;
• A granted adjournment would be an
abuse of the conduct of these proceedings within the Tribunal and inconsistent
Tribunal’s case management process.
5 The granting of this adjournment will, of course, add to the
delay in determining this matter. That delay is likely to be exacerbated
time taken to have the applicant physically and mentally assessed and then the
possible requirement for further consideration
by the Board’s expert
witnesses. Other litigants in this jurisdiction are likely to be prejudiced by
the flow on delay of
unutilised hearing time within the Tribunal. Additionally
the Tribunal, at the present, has only one Member, who has concurrent
responsibilities in other Tribunals. Given there has been a delay in filling
the vacant Member position, there is limited flexibility
of the Tribunal to deal
with this matter in a timely manner in the near future. It is in the public
interest that the Tribunal processes
be complied with and that matters are able
to be determined in a timely manner by efficient use of the Tribunal’s
6 However, a litigant must be provided with a fair and
reasonable opportunity to present their case and “case management
should not supplant the objective of doing justice between the
parties according to law” (Aon Risk Services Australia Limited
Australian National University
[2009] HCA 27).
7 The desire to seek
psychiatric opinion at this late stage, is one thing that in isolation may not
have justified the application
for an adjournment, but the fact that the
applicant is unable to present the expert medical evidence she has or in the
manner desired,
clearly deprives her the opportunity to properly and fully
present her case. On that basis, the adjournment is granted.
8 However, the
Tribunal orders that the applicant pay the Board’s costs of this
application for adjournment together with the
costs of and incidental to the
preparation for hearing of this matter, such costs to be at the rate of 85% of
the fees set out in
Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules 2000. The
Tribunal does not accept that the circumstances justify an order for costs
indemnity basis.
9 It is further directed by the Tribunal that the
(a) Advise the Tribunal and the Board’s solicitor within
10 days of the doctor’s name and proposed date of any appointment
physical or mental assessment; and
(b) Provide to the Tribunal and the
Board’s solicitor within 21 days of the date of such assessment, any
report or proof of
evidence intended to be relied upon by the applicant.
