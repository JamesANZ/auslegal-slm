REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application made on referral to the Tribunal by the Chief Executive under
Agents and Motor Dealers Act
, which I shall call
“the Act”. It is a claim against the claim fund established under
the Act. The applicant, Kerry
Lee Edwards, alleges that she has suffered a
financial loss from the conduct of the respondent, John Gary Ivanoff, as a
motor dealer.
Factual background
August 2007, Ms Edwards caused friends to deliver a motor vehicle owned by her
to a car yard operated by the respondent, called
“Park and Sell”, in
Miami on the Gold Coast. At the time, the respondent was a licensed motor
dealer. Ms Edwards’
friends agreed, on her behalf, with the respondent to
leave the car there for sale on consignment by him. However, no paperwork
appointing Mr Ivanoff as her agent to sell the car on consignment was produced
by Mr Ivanoff or signed by Ms Edwards or anyone on
her behalf.
some months, Ms Edwards attempted to ascertain whether a purchaser had been
located for the car. She had great difficulty contacting
Mr Ivanoff. She flew
to the Gold Coast from the Northern Territory, where she was living, hired a car
and travelled to the car yard
in September 2007 and again in October 2007. Her
car was not present on the lot on either occasion.
the first occasion, Mr Ivanoff told her that the car was with a potential buyer,
who had offered less than the asking price. Ms
Edwards reluctantly authorised
him to sell it for the lower price.
the second occasion, Mr Ivanoff told her that a potential buyer had it and was
arranging a roadworthy certificate. Two days later
she was informed by Mr
Ivanoff’s car detailer that someone had bought the car and paid a
$1,000.00 deposit and had picked it
up. She was paid the sum of $1000 that day
and was told that the balance would be received in two days time.
6 November 2007 she attended at the car yard again and demanded the return of
her car. Mr Ivanoff told her that the car had been
sold for $9000 and attempted
to give her a further $1,000.00 in cash, but she refused payment. She then had
to return to the Northern
subsequently noticed that Mr Ivanoff had deposited $1,500.00 in her bank
account. She has retained that sum. She has never been
paid any other sum, nor
has the car been returned to her.
Edwards claims a total of $28,548.40 from the claim fund which is divided as
(a) the value of the car $19,670.00
(b) hire car and fuel $
(c) air fares $ 1,937.00
(d) lost wages $
(e) estimated food and accommodation costs $ 1,200.00
years insurance $ 4,091.40
(g) estimated phone call costs 100.00
Edwards has produced to the Tribunal receipts for some of the items claimed, but
not all of them. She says that the sum claimed
for the value of the car is the
insured value, but she has not produced any evidence to substantiate that sum.
Indeed, she had been
unsuccessful in attempting to sell the vehicle between
$12,000 and $14,000 shortly before placing it with the car yard.
Red Book is said to value the particular vehicle at between $9,000 and $12,000
and Ms Edwards had been informed by Mr Ivanoff
that the vehicle had been sold
for an agreed price of $9,000.00. Of this, she was paid $1,500.00 in about
November 2007 and a further
$1,000.00 shortly afterwards.
these circumstances, I am satisfied that the respondent has stolen,
misappropriated or misapplied property entrusted to him as
agent for Ms Edwards
in his capacity as a relevant person, namely a licensed motor dealer. I am
satisfied that Ms Edwards has suffered
a financial loss because of Mr
Ivanoff’s conduct.
regard to the evidence about the value of the car and a price for which it was
allegedly sold, I cannot be satisfied that it
was worth more than the sale
price. Accordingly, Ms Edwards has lost the difference between that price and
the amount which she
was paid by Mr Ivanoff, namely $6,500.00. In addition, I
am satisfied from the documents produced by Ms Edwards that she has incurred
expenses comprising $253.29 for car rental and $1,939.24 for airfares, a total
of $2,192.53. Ms Edwards has not been able to produce
any records proving the
other amounts claimed by her, which are really just estimates. I am not able to
be satisfied that they were
incurred and form part of her loss.
Accordingly,
I am satisfied that Ms Edwards has suffered financial loss in the sum of
$8,692.53. The person liable for that financial
loss is the respondent, Mr
