Number BRM0314
at Jim's Plains in the Circular Head Municipality.
The hearing was held
by the Tribunal at
day of December
There was no attendance by the parties, the hearing being
conducted upon the basis of agreed facts and agreement by all parties to
Tribunal upholding the decision of the Forest Practices Authority appealed
Application
was made for approval of forest practices plan number BRM 0314 (the
“FPP"). The total operational area was 311
ha, and was located at Jim's
Plains, Woolnorth Region in the Circular Head Municipality. No timber would be
harvested, and the whole
of the operational area would be converted to
Forest Practices Authority refused approval for the FPP on the basis of the
presence of an (undifferentiated) " wetland" community
listed as "threatened"
under Schedule 3A of the
Nature Conservation Act 2002 and,
presence of potential habitat for the dwarf galaxias
(Galaxias pusilla).
The latter species is listed as "threatened" under the Threatened Species
Protection Act. It is also listed as "Vulnerable" under
Environment
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
(Commonwealth).
appeal was lodged against the refusal of the FPP, however the parties
subsequently reached agreement that the decision of the Forest
Authority should be upheld.
19(1AA) of the
Forest Practices Act 1985
provides that the Forest
Practices Authority is not to certify a FPP involving the clearance and
conversion of a threatened native
vegetation community, unless the authority is
satisfied of one or more of the following:
the clearance and conversion is justified by exceptional
circumstances;
the activities authorised by the
forest practices plan are likely to have an overall environmental benefit;
the clearance and conversion is
unlikely to detract substantially from the conservation of the threatened native
vegetation community;
the clearance and conversion is
unlikely to detract substantially from the conservation values in the vicinity
of the threatened
native vegetation community."
Documentation
establishing the uncontested facts underlying the refusal of the FPP was
supplied to the Tribunal. As a result of considering
that documentation, the
Tribunal finds that the conduct of forestry operations in accordance with the
FPP, would involve the clearance
and conversion of a threatened native
vegetation community, the above (undifferentiated) "wetland" threatened
communityand endanger
the dwarf Galaxias species which is variously listed as
"vulnerable" and "threatened", as described above.
was no evidence of any facts which would enable the Tribunal to be satisfied of
any of the matters set out in subparagraphs
(a) to (d) of Section 19 (1AA)
reproduced above.
those findings, the Tribunal, exercising the powers and duties of the Forest
Practices Authority, is obliged to refuse approval
for the Forest Practices
Tribunal is also obliged to take into account the financial effect of its
decision upon the Appellant. No specific particulars
of financial effect were
provided, but the Tribunal infers that absent any compensation, the refusal of
the FPP will occasion loss
to the Appellant.
all those matters into account, the Tribunal is satisfied that the refusal to
approve the forest practices plan was and is
appropriate.
order of the Tribunal is that it upholds the decision of the Forest Practices
Authority appealed against, and refuses approval
for Forest Practices Plan
Tribunal will entertain any application for an order for costs in this appeal,
if made to the Tribunal in writing with supporting
submissions within the next
14 days. If requested the Tribunal will reconvene to hear any evidence in
respect of any matter bearing
on an order for costs.
the absence of any such application for an order for costs the order of the
Tribunal is that each party bears its own costs.
