REASONS FOR DISMISSAL
29 November 2024, the
of Western Australia gave notice under
Native Title Act
(Cth) of its intention to
grant prospecting licence P 51/3407-S to Laurence John Molloy
notice included a statement that the State considers the grant of the
proposed licence to be an act attracting the expedited procedure
Native Title Act
expedited procedure applies, the State may grant the proposed licence without
requiring parties to enter the right to negotiate
procedure per
Native Title Act
[3] The proposed
licence is located approximately 55 km in a northeasterly direction from Cue and
covers an area of approximately
0.1 km². The proposed licence sits within
the area of the Wajarri Yamatji Part A native title determination (WCD2017/007),
held in trust by the
Wajarri Yamaji
Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC as the
registered native title body corporate.
January 2025, Wajarri Yamaji lodged an objection to the State’s assertion
that the expedited procedure applies to
the grant of the licence with the
National Native Title
. The objection application was lodged
within the timeframe outlined in
Native Title Act
such, under
, the Tribunal is required to determine whether the grant of
the proposed licence is an act attracting the expedited procedure.
Relevant Facts
a delegation from the President of the Tribunal, I was appointed to constitute
the Tribunal for the purposes of the inquiry
in this matter.
a Conference held on 25 June 2025, the grantee stated their preference for the
matter to proceed to inquiry. I made directions
requiring all parties to provide
submissions to the inquiry. Wajarri Yamaji were directed to provide contentions
and evidence by
27 August 2025, however on the date of compliance, no
contentions or evidence were received from Wajarri Yamaji.
September 2025 the Tribunal sent an email to all parties, noting that Wajarri
Yamaji had failed to comply with directions
and that the objection application
was now at risk of dismissal
Parties were provided until close of
business 9 September 2025 to make any comments and in the case of Wajarri Yamaji
request further
time. No response was received from Wajarri Yamaji.
Consideration of Dismissal
[8] Pursuant
Native Title Act
, the Tribunal may dismiss an
objection application at any stage of the inquiry in circumstances where the
native title party fails
within a reasonable time to proceed with the objection
application or to comply with a direction of the Tribunal. While the Tribunal
has broad discretion to dismiss an objection application, doing so has
significant consequences for the native title party and is
not an action taken
[9] The nature
of the expedited procedure and the principles relevant to consideration of
dismissal of an objection application for
failure to comply with directions are
set out in the Tribunal's decision in
Teelow v Page
[13]. I have applied
those principles in my consideration of this matter.
[10] On this
occasion, it is my view that Wajarri Yamaji has been afforded sufficient
opportunity to progress this objection application
but have failed to do so
within a reasonable time. The Tribunal allowed ample time and opportunity for
Wajarri Yamaji to provide
evidence for the inquiry or request an extension to do
so, however Wajarri Yamaji failed to comply with directions.
[11] Having
regard to all of the facts and circumstances of this matter, I am satisfied that
the objection application should be
Determination
expedited procedure objection application in relation to prospecting licence
P 51/3407-S is dismissed under
Native Title
