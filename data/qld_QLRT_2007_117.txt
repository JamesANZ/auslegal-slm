CATCHWORDS: MINING LEASE – DETERMINATION OF COMPENSATION –
Mineral Resources Act
COUNSEL: N/A
SOLICITOR/S: N/A
Peter Clayton and Graham
Forss (the miners) currently hold ML60204. The mining lease was originally
granted on 1 January 1996 for
a period of 10 years. On 20 June 2005 the miners
lodged an application for renewal of the mining lease for a term of 10 years
the Mining Registrar, Quilpie District.
The lease is located on
Bingara Station, which is owned by
Shane and Peta Warner (the
landholders). Access to the lease is through Bingara Station. The lease is for
the purpose of mining
for opal and has an area of
Referral to Tribunal
On 19 March 2007 the Mining
Registrar referred the issue of the determination of compensation to the
tribunal under
Mineral Resources Act
(the Act). On 8
August 2007, President Koppenol allocated this matter to
Relevant Facts
The limited material that I
have reveals that the miners and the landholders entered into a written
compensation agreement on 4 May
2005. From material provided by the Mining
Registrar, it would seem that a copy of that agreement has been filed, but the
Registrar has no evidence of the compensation agreement being
By the compensation
agreement, the parties agreed that the miners would pay the landholders the sum
of $30.00 per annum for a period
of 5 years, and that the mining lease would be
renewed for a term of 5
The relevant legislative
provisions regarding compensation are set out in
Section 279
(1)(a) provides
as follows:
“(1) A mining lease shall not be granted or renewed unless
(a) compensation has been determined (whether by agreement or by
determination of the tribunal) between the applicant and each person
owner of land the surface of which is the subject of the application and of any
surface access to the mining lease land;
(b)...and the conditions of the agreement or determination have been or
are being complied with by the applicant.”
(1)(a) to the
facts at hand, it would appear to be beyond doubt that, by the parties entering
into a compensation agreement,
compensation
‘has been determined’.
There is no evidence before the Tribunal as to whether or not the conditions of
the agreement,
including payment of the sum of $30.00 per annum by the miners,
are being complied with.
Section 279
(3) is also of
relevance. It provides that and an
“agreement made pursuant to
subsection (1)(a) shall not be effective”
until it is in writing and
signed by the parties, and has been filed with the Mining Registrar.
(4) then provides that,
if the agreement is required by law to be stamped,
it shall not be filed until it is stamped. Given the
known facts, the
compensation
agreement is in writing; has been signed; and has been provided to
the Mining Registrar. It would
seem that the compensation agreement
been stamped, and I have no evidence or submissions before me as to whether or
particular agreement is required
to be stamped. However, even acting
on the assumption that the compensation agreement requires
stamping, according
to the Act the
compensation agreement is simply expressed as being ‘not
effective’ until it is filed
after having been stamped.
In my view, the impact of
the Act on the facts at hand is clear. By entering into an agreement,
compensation has been determined,
but that determination may not be effective
until such time as the agreement is stamped. The outstanding issues are
procedural under
the Act. From a jurisdictional perspective, there is no power
for the Tribunal to determine compensation as compensation is already
determined, and I order accordingly.
I appreciate that this
decision does not necessarily fit well with the manner in which Mining
Registrars’ usually perform their
functions under the Act, particularly in
circumstances where miners take an inordinate amount of time to stamp
compensation agreements.
However, be that as it may, there are clear, important
issues of legal construction and statutory interpretation which remove any
that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine compensation in
circumstances where it is already determined (even
with procedural issues
outstanding). In the case at hand, were the Tribunal to proceed to a normal
determination of compensation
in circumstances where there was no agreement
between the parties, a sum of compensation would be determined as compensation
a 10 year renewal of the mining lease. However, as is clear, the parties
have agreed by the terms of their compensation agreement
that this mining lease
is only to be renewed for a period of 5 years.
As the landholders pointed
out in a letter of 20 May 2007 to the Tribunal:
“We signed a compensation agreement for this lease in 2005 in good
faith & fully expected it to be processed in the accepted
If it is the case that the
compensation agreement in this matter is required to be stamped, it would seem
that the Mining Registrar
has power under
(1)(m) of the Act to order the
miners to have the compensation agreement stamped and then filed with the Mining
Registrar. That
is the appropriate course which should be followed in this
I direct the Registrar to
provide a copy of this decision to the Mining
