Smith v The King [2025] HCADisp 265 (6 November 2025)
[2025] HCADisp
applicant seeks special leave to appeal from the whole of the judgment of the
Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland
(Bond, Flanagan and
Brown JJA) which dismissed an appeal against conviction following a trial
before Crowley J and a jury in the
Supreme Court of Queensland.
proposed appeal raises no question of general or public importance and has
insufficient prospects of success to justify a grant
of special leave.
leave to appeal is refused.
