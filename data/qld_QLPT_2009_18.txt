SOLICITORS:
Legal Services Commission for the applicant
SJP Law for the respondent
[1] The Tribunal gave its decision in this matter on 12 June
making orders finding the practitioner
guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct with respect to Charges 1 to 8 and
Charges 9 and 10.
[2] The Tribunal had ordered in its
reasons that in the absence of exceptional circumstances the practitioner must
pay the Commissioner’s
and the complainant’s costs to be assessed on
the Supreme Court scale on the standard basis or as agreed. Counsel for the
practitioner then sought to argue that there was some other basis upon which a
different order for costs might be made. The matter
was adjourned so that
further submissions in support of that contention might be made.
parties have since agreed on a costs order which has made unnecessary any
further submissions, although Mr B McMillan for
the Commissioner has provided a
reference to the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Legal Services
Commissioner v Bradshaw
which affirms the
approach of McPherson JA in Baker v Legal Services
Commissioner
that, notwithstanding success on
some charges, the mandatory terms of
apply to the costs of the whole
proceedings.
[4] The order as agreed by the parties is:
The practitioner
pay the Commissioner’s costs fixed in the amount of $20,000 within three
[5] The Tribunal proposed in the reasons that if neither
party made submissions to the contrary then the penalty should be that the
practitioner be publicly reprimanded and be fined $7,000 to be paid within three
[6] The Commissioner and the practitioner accept that the public
reprimand is appropriate. The Commissioner contends for a more substantial
in the order of $15,000 to $20,000. The practitioner seeks to support the fine
[7] The Commissioner contends, both on the basis of the findings
by the Tribunal about the nature of the practitioner’s conduct
comparison with other fines for disciplinary offences against practitioners,
that a higher fine is called for. The Commissioner
has focussed on the falsity
of statements made by the practitioner in the documents filed in the Magistrates
Court proceedings which
were the subject of Charges 5 and 7 and draws an analogy
with the conduct in Legal Services Commissioner v
where the Tribunal said:
“Turning to the characterisation of this misconduct, it was plainly
professional misconduct, [the practitioner pleaded to that
charge] though not
characterised by dishonesty. It was a case of gross carelessness or sloppiness,
dereliction which has no place
in the preparation of any affidavit, but
especially one to be sworn by an officer of the Court. That it was prepared in
in the end irrelevant.”
The Tribunal fined the practitioner $5,000 remarking that it was misconduct
which fell “well short” of that in Legal
Services Commissioner v
where a fine of $20,000 was
[8] In Mullins an actual fraudulent deception was engaged in at a
mediation which had significant monetary implications for the two
– one standing to gain a windfall to which he was not entitled and the
other, correspondingly, to pay out much more
than the true facts required.
Mullins involved only one charge but involved serious deceit, the gravemen of
which was expressly
to keep the true facts from the other side so that more
money in settlement would be offered. Here, as was found, the practitioner
that his opponent knew of the incorrect inclusion of the legal aid items in the
bill, that is, the negotiations did not proceed
on a false understanding. The
practitioner erred in failing to give his opponent the second assessed bill of
[9] Although the practitioner was found guilty of eight charges, they
all stemmed from the one source of carelessly including the
$1,300.23 item paid
by Legal Aid in the bill of costs. Each subsequent act was discrete, of
course, but each was founded on that
one event. What went wrong thereafter was
directly referable to the practitioner’s large number of files and a
highly disorganised
[10] Reference might also be made to Legal
Services Commissioner v Madden (No 2).
practitioner was charged with and found guilty of neglect, undue delay and
failure to maintain reasonable standards of competence
or diligence, acting
without instructions, breaching a provision of the
Trust Accounts Act 1973
and overcharging in respect of one client, and charges of failure to maintain
reasonable standards of competence and diligence
and conflict of interest with
respect to another client. The practitioner had previous disciplinary findings
against him before
the Solicitors Complaints Tribunal. He was fined
[11] As is well recognised, disciplinary penalties are not imposed
as punishment but rather in the interests of the protection of
the community
from unsuitable practitioners.
As the Court
held in Madden,
in determining what penalty
the court should impose and what order should be made, regard must primarily be
had to the protection
of the public and the maintenance of proper professional
standards. It is recognised
that co-operation
with the investigation is a favourable factor to take into account and that
occurred in this practitioner’s
case. As the material before the Tribunal
showed, the practitioner made all appropriate factual concessions. Furthermore
no disciplinary history. He is well regarded by his fellow practitioners
with whom he works. He carried out many hours of pro bono
work prior to these
matters being referred to the Commissioner and thereafter. More importantly, he
engaged in a complete overhaul
of the way in which his firm has been managed
since 2004. It would appear that this file was an isolated incident which has
him considerable financial loss as well as professional embarrassment.
The public reprimand together with the ventilation of his
fall from professional
standards to his professional colleagues as well as the significant quantum of
the Commissioner’s costs
would fulfil the necessary role of deterrence for
other practitioners.
[12] The penalty is that:
• The practitioner be
publicly reprimanded; and
• The practitioner be fined $7,000 to be paid
within three months of the date of publication of these reasons.
orders are:
1. The practitioner pay the Commissioner’s costs fixed in
the amount of $20,000 within three months.
2. The practitioner be publicly
reprimanded.
3. The practitioner be fined $7,000 to be paid within three
months of the date of publication of these reasons.
