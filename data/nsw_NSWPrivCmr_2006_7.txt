NSW Electoral Commission and Easy Voting Card [2006] NSWPrivCmr 7 (1 July 2006)
NSW Electoral Commission and Easy Voting Card
In the lead up to the March 2007 New South Wales state election Privacy NSW
received 7 complaints and enquiries in relation to a mail
out by the NSW
Electoral Commission of an elector brochure and easy voting card. The brochure
contained general information about
the election and the easy voting card, which
formed part of the brochure, contained individual’s enrolment details
their name, address, date of birth and the electoral district they
belonged to.
The main privacy concern expressed by people who contacted us centred on
their personal information, specifically their date of birth,
being included in
the mail out, along with their name and address. People were worried that this
information might fall into the
wrong hands and possibly give rise to identity
theft. Complainants pointed to the danger of having their date of birth
information
provided in circumstances where the addressee has moved and the
correspondence is then left unclaimed “for all to grab”.
The risk of
the information being misused, when left unclaimed, may be much higher in large
residential complexes.
Another example given was that some electors might mistake the electoral
brochure for some sort of ‘junk mail’ and discard
realising that their personal information, particularly their date of birth, is
included with the brochure. Overall,
the complainants expressed a view that
inclusion of their date of birth with the brochure was potentially privacy
intrusive and not
necessary. Some of the complainants were further concerned
of the electoral roll.
In considering the issue, we contacted the NSW Electoral Commission for their
views. It turned out that the amendments made to the
Parliamentary
Electorates and Elections Act 1912
(the PE&E Act) last year removed the
requirement for electors to provide their occupation details and required them
provide their date of birth. The effect of the amendment is that
electoral officials at the time of voting are required to ask for
voter’s date of birth to confirm their identity.
The NSW Electoral Commissioner (NSWEC) argued that the purpose of the easy
voting card is two-fold: first, it draws an elector’s
attention to the
details that are currently held by the NSWEC, giving them an opportunity to
correct any mistakes, and secondly,
it assists election officials to locate the
elector on the certified list and reduces the time electors spend in line
have their name marked off the roll on Election day.
The Electoral Commissioner considers it necessary to provide certain
important election information directly to each elector and is
of the view that
this does not constitute insensitivity regarding the elector’s personal
information nor a breach of an elector’s
the Electoral Commissioner was aware, the correspondence was individually
addressed, posted in a sealed
envelope and delivered by Australia Post.
We noted in our advice to the complainants that the PE&E Act provides
strict guidelines as to how the rolls can be publicly inspected
and prohibits
disclosure or commercial use of enrolment information, placing heavy penalties
on offenders. We appreciate that the
discretion whether to provide dates of
birth for public inspection rests with the Electoral Commissioner and we
obtained assurances
from the Commission that there is no intention to make this
information public.
