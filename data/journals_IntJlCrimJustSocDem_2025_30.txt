Torin Monahan’s
Crisis Vision: Race
and the Cultural Production of Surveillance
, part of the Errantries series
edited by Simone Browne, Deborah Cowen and Katherine McKittrick, is a
critical review of critical
surveillance art—art that has emerged as a
response to the ever-expanding systems of surveillance now embedded in our
While aiming to critique and challenge issues of domination, oppression
and inequality, surveillance art can (in)advertently contribute
to cultural
production of racialised and gendered viewpoints. Monahan’s is a crucial
and timely intervention into the cultural
productions of surveillance,
consolidating years of his scholarly work on surveillance art into
interpretation of viewing subjects
(Monahan 2018), anti-surveillance camouflage
(Monahan 2015), and artistic disruptions of antiblack surveillance (Monahan
To unpack this layered idea of cultural productions of surveillance through
surveillance art, Monahan introduces two theoretical concepts
through which artworks are analysed. For Monahan,
crisis vision
is an idea that reflects the sense of insecurity in the
contemporary world, filtered through racialised visibility. For example, the
idea of deploying surveillance make-up to dazzle surveillance cameras in public
spaces may place a larger target on the backs of
black and brown bodies who are
already hyper-visible to law enforcement in a lot of the countries of the Global
North. Paying drug-addicted
sex workers US$67 to create a permanent line tattoo
on their bodies may highlight the social conditions of violence in which they
exist, but is it not necessitated by those conditions. The goal of
Monahan’s work is not to engage in critiques of specific,
artworks, but to reflect on the ways in which these artworks function as
political performances that contribute to discourses
on surveillance and inflect
cultural understandings of crisis vision. Five artistic frames support this
critical analysis of numerous
artworks considered in the book—avoidance,
transparency, complicity, violence and disruption.
section (Chapter 1) considers
countersurveillance designs and artworks that challenge the diminishing public.
In reviewing the works
of Leo Selvaggio, Danielle Baskin and a variety of
surveillance camouflage techniques, Monahan argues that they provide
‘hyper-individualised
and consumer-oriented adaptations to undesired
surveillance’ (p. 38). While acknowledging the solidarity-building aspect
works, Monahan argues that they further
disadvantage, among others, the social ‘Others’ who are already
hyper-visible
in policed public spaces. The
transparency
section (Chapter 2) extends further the inquiry into
surveillance art by looking at practices of surveillance archiving through
documentation,
simulation, and compilation. Using the works of Trevor Paglen,
Josh Begley and Hasan Elahi (among others analysed) as examples, Monahan
demonstrates how surveillance archives can posit a counterstrategy to state and
corporate surveillance. In this context, the opacity—not
transparency—of these counter-archives becomes a response to challenging
and questioning invasive state surveillance.
section (Chapter 3) reviews works that draw upon
opacity, illegibility, and participatory techniques to foster self-reflexivity
responsibility between the artworks and their viewers. Monahan’s
analysis of certain artworks through the complicity frame
effectively prompts
viewers to develop crucial perspectives on surveillance. For example, Dries
Depoorter’s artwork,
, offers viewers the option to
report an image of a genuine person jaywalking, captured on camera without their
awareness. The artists
of these works, however, are cautioned to be mindful of
their own positions and avoid re-producing the neoliberal and racialised
viewpoints they set off to challenge. The
frame (Chapter 4)
explores how to reveal the objectifying and exploitative dimensions of crisis
vision, like a mirror reflecting the
destructive elements of racialised crisis
vision and allowing artists to confront the cruelty that surveillance can
inflicts. At
the same timethe
frame has the capacity to further
dehumanise the subjects it portrays through artists’ orientations and
approaches. The last
(Chapter 5), focuses on
challenging authority and its sanctioned forms of racial violence through
channelling community.

In the five art frame sections, Monahan skilfully intertwines various
theoretical threads to construct a perspective on how critical
surveillance art
can strive to garner attention, not just for consumeristic and individualistic
objectives, but to challenge the
existing institutional dynamics that facilitate
surveillance in the first place. Certainly, surveillance plays a crucial role in
the functioning of crisis vision, ensuring the maintenance of a semblance of
equality and democracy in the distribution of perceptions,
while simultaneously
enforcing inequality and exclusion. Hence, critical surveillance art can
actively disrupt surveillance in locations
where it has adverse racial and
gender impacts. Nonetheless, in several areas of the book, the gender lens
could have been explored
in further depth along with racialisation, especially
considering that critical gender scholarship has been incorporated throughout
the manuscript. As Lisa Bowleg (2013: 754) observes in her intersectional
scholarship on the experiences of black queer men, ‘once
blended the cake, you can’t take the parts back to the main
ingredients.’
In the first comprehensive scholarly inquiry of its kind, Monahan’s
Crisis Vision: Race and the Cultural Production of Surveillance
readers with the conceptual tools to unravel the
which surveillance art attempts to approach and disrupt
and to evaluate whether surveillance art is successful in its
mission to tackle issues of domination, oppression and inequality.
surveillance art has long been considered an important part of surveillance
scholarship due to its ability to grab and mobilise
attention of the broader
public. For example, the global Surveillance Studies Network (2024) that
facilities surveillance scholarship
also provides surveillance art grants,
prizes and runs an
section in the connected
Surveillance
journal. Critical surveillance art risks re-producing the same
subjectivities that it aims to oppose, without challenging the
of unwanted surveillance.
The contribution of Monahan’s
Crisis Vision: Race and the Cultural
Production of Surveillance
to the surveillance studies body of work is
unique in its line of inquiry and the theoretical tools that it gifts to the
intersectional
field of surveillance studies scholars and artists. In the words
of the author, the purpose of the book is ‘not about watching
watchers, dyadic resistance, or a retreat into privacy. Instead, it is about
securing spaces for collective existence without
being categorised and sorter,
without being atomised and diminished’ (p.146).
