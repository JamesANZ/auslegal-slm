CONCERNING A DISPUTE
between Mr Zarko
Cicarevic (the “client”) and Williams Winter (the “legal
practitioner”).
REASONS OF LEGAL PROFESSION TRIBUNAL FOR DECISION GIVEN
ON 5 MAY 2005
(Section 409 Legal Practice Act)
This is a costs dispute. The question has arisen, whether this Tribunal
has the jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute.
Section 122 of
Legal Practice Act 1996
defines disputes. In relation to costs
disputes, a dispute is a dispute in relation to legal costs, not exceeding
$15,000 in respect
of any one matter between a legal practitioner or firm and a
person who is charged with those costs or is liable to pay those costs
than under a court or tribunal order for costs)...
The section goes on to
set out another definition, which is not relevant to this dispute.
costs are defined by s.3 of the Act as meaning all amounts that a person has
been, or may be charged by, or is or may become
liable to pay a legal
practitioner or firm for the provision of legal services, including
disbursements, but not including interest.
The question of whether the
Tribunal has jurisdiction arises from the fact that the legal practitioner sent
a letter dated 21 October
2003 to another solicitor, who had been engaged by the
client, enclosing a certificate of assessment of professional costs prepared
an independent firm of legal costs consultants. The covering letter stated
Upon payment of the amount as assessed by Arnold & Company Legal Costing we
will release our file, documents, correspondence
and memoranda in this
The Certificate of Assessment referred only to professional
costs. It excluded disbursements. The amount of those professional costs
stated to be $13,003.90. The client made a complaint to Professional Standards
in relation to the costs. This complaint is
dated 1 November 2003. On 6
November 2003 the client requested the legal practitioner to provide an itemised
account. The legal
practitioner provided an itemised account of costs and
disbursements. This was dated 10 December 2003 and was sent to the client,
under cover of a letter bearing the same date.
Several questions have
arisen in the course of submissions on the questions of jurisdiction. The first
is whether the provision of
the certificate of assessment, dated 20 October
2003, constitutes a bill of costs. Section 107 of the
Legal Practice Act
sets out that a bill of costs may be in the form of a lump sum bill or
an itemised bill and that it must be signed by the legal practitioner,
another legal practitioner authorised by the legal practitioner, or an approved
clerk, or in the case of the firm, by a partner.
It seems to be common ground
that the certificate of assessment does not constitute a bill of costs.
Nevertheless, it may still
be possible for a client to be liable to pay costs,
even if not charged with those costs, or indeed, one may be charged with costs
under circumstances outside the actual provision of a formal bill. The question
then is whether it is possible for the provision
of the subsequent itemised bill
of costs to set or increase the costs and, if so, whether it takes the dispute
outside the jurisdiction
limit of this tribunal.
It is common ground
that on an assessment before a Taxing Master, s118(2) of the Act permits the
legal practitioner not to be bound
by the amount and matters stated in a lump
sum bill. It would appear that in any case the certificate of assessment does
not constitute
a bill as such.
Counsel assisting submitted that the
dispute before the Tribunal is constituted by the complaint made to Professional
Standards and
that the subsequent production of an account higher that the
account initially complained of excludes it from the ambit of the dispute.
has been a long held practice of this Tribunal to accept that a dispute may
change in detail between the time of the lodging
of the initial complaint and
the time of the issuing of a notice pursuant to s128(1) of the Act by the RPA
stating that it is unable
to settle the dispute. This has always in the past
been decided in the context of the details of the client’s dispute
between those two dates. The Tribunal has always accepted that the
dispute, as referred to the Tribunal, is the dispute as at the
date of the
s128(1) letter. In this case, it appears that the changing of the detail of the
dispute has come about as the result
of the production of the itemised bill of
costs and disbursements. Philosophically there is no difference between that
and the situation
where the client alters the details of the dispute. A dispute
is by its very nature a two sided matter and one which is capable
amended prior to the date upon which it crystallizes for referral to this
A further aspect which must be taken into account is that the
letter of 21 October 2003, sent by the legal practitioner to the client,
not state that the accompanying amount of costs assessed by the legal costing
consultants is the final account. Nor in fact
does it say that it constitutes
the substance of the account at all. It merely states that upon payment of that
amount the file
will be released to the clients new legal practitioner
The itemised bill of costs and disbursements, dated 10 December 2003
sets out as its final figures the sum of $14,044.36 as professional
the further sum of $2,927.20 as disbursements, making a total of $16,971.56. I
am unable to conclude from the contents
of the letter dated 21 October 2003 that
the legal practitioner intended to forgo the disbursements. That being the
case, the disbursements,
when added to the professional fees of $13,003.90 would
come to a figure in excess of $15,000.00, that is in excess of the jurisdiction
of this Tribunal. It may also be said that by producing the itemised bill of
accounts the legal practitioner was setting out what
it considered to be the
amount of costs and disbursements owing to it within the context of the dispute
between it and the client.
As I have said, the dispute, that is the complaint,
was initiated prior to the request for the itemised account and the production
of that itemised account.
Under the circumstances, I find that the
amount in dispute is the amount of the costs and disbursements, as set out in
the itemised
account dated 10 December 2003. I therefore find that the Tribunal
does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine this dispute.
