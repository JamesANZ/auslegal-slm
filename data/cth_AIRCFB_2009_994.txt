This is an application by the Australian Workers Union (AWU) to vary the terms of Schedule A—Transitional Provisions of the
Pastoral Award 2010
(modern award). The application concerns the operation of the transitional provisions in relation to the piecework rates of pay for
employees classified within
– Shearing Operations of the modern award. Employees engaged on shearing operations are substantially remunerated by the piecework
rates set out in cl.45 of the modern award.
The stated object of the application is to properly reflect that part of the National Employment Standards (the NES) which prescribes
that the ordinary hours of work will be 38 per week or an average thereof.
The piecework rates provided by the award are derived from a formula based on an assumption that a shearer would shear an average
of 500 sheep per 40 hour week. With the introduction of the 38 hour week as a term of the modern award the formula was adjusted and
the piecework rates in cl.45 reflect that adjustment.
While the award provisions relating to hours of work commence on 1 January 2010, pursuant to the transitional provisions the rates
of pay, including the piecework rates, do not commence until the first pay period on or after 1 July 2010. The application seeks
to bring forward the operation of the 38 hour week for employees in
More specifically, the AWU submitted that the piecework rates prescribed by cl.45 should, and do, reflect the NES provisions as to
ordinary hours and therefore should operate in full from the commencement of the award on 1 January 2010. It submitted that if the
application is not granted the operation of the transitional provisions will be such that it will be five years before shearers are
paid an equivalent amount, in relative terms, for working a 38 hour week as they previously received when working the 40 hour week.
While the AWU originally sought that the date of effect of the variation sought be 1 January 2010, it has amended its application
so that the variation it now seeks would not take effect before 1 July 2010. The National Farmer’s Federation (NFF) consents
to the application as amended.
We consider that the application has merit and is a logical response to a somewhat unique set of circumstances arising from the interaction
between the hours of work provisions and the piecework rates in
of the modern award. The agreement between the AWU and NFF is significant and should be given considerable weight. The proposed date
of effect allows a short period of transition and preparation for the operation of the new provisions during the shearing season.
We have decided we should make a variation in the following form:
Schedule A—Transitional Provisions
Clause A.2.5 to be varied as follows:
From the following dates, subject to cl.A.2.8, the employer must pay no less than the minimum wage for the classification in this
award minus the specified proportion of the transitional amount:
First full pay period on or after:
1 July 2010 80%
1 July 2011 60%
1 July 2012 40%
1 July 2013 20%
The following provision be added to cl.A.2:
A.2.8 The minimum wage(s) for the classifications in clause 45 of
of this award apply from 1 July 2010.
Given the time of the year and the limited opportunity for submissions from other parties with an interest in the modern award, we
shall reserve the rights of any party other than the AWU and the NFF to make a further application to alter the subject provisions.
An order to give effect to this decision will be issued in due course.
