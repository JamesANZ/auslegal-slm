REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
Introduction
claimant was injured in a motor accident but did not give notice to the Motor
Accidents Insurance Board (the Board) until more
than six years later. He has
applied for an extension of time to claim compensation. The Board submits that
the Tribunal does not
have the power to extend time beyond six years. I agree.
Legislative scheme
Motor Accidents (Liabilities and Compensation) Regulations 2020 (the
Regulations) impose a time limit within which a claimant
may apply to the Board
for compensation. Regulation 10 provides:
10. Scheduled benefits
(1) The benefits payable under section
23(1), (1A) or (2) of the Act by the Board in respect of a
matter are the benefits specified
in Schedule 1 for that
(2) A person may make a claim for benefits
payable under section 23(1) , (1A) or
the Act in respect of a motor accident if –
(a) within one year after the date of the motor
accident, written notice of the personal injury giving rise to the claim is
to the Board; and
(b) the claim is brought within one year
(i) the date of death resulting directly from
the motor accident; or
(ii) the date on which loss or expense
resulting directly from the motor accident was incurred; or
(iii) the date on which gratuitous care
required as a direct result of the motor accident was, or services care required
as a direct
result of the motor accident were, provided.
(3) On application by the person making the
claim and after hearing such evidence as it considers appropriate, the Tribunal
a period referred to in subregulation (2) by such
period not exceeding 5 years as it thinks fit.
(4) The Tribunal may extend either period
referred to in subregulation (2) even though one or both of the
periods has expired.
can be seen, a claimant needs to give written notice of injury to the Board
within a year of the accident: reg 10(2)(a). The Tribunal
may extend that time
by up to five years: reg 10(3). This produces a maximum period of six years
within which to apply for compensation.
Application to extend
claimant’s application is put on the following basis. On 31 January 2019,
he was driving his car. Attempting to avoid a
head-on collision, he swerved and
drove down a steep embankment. His vehicle was severely damaged and subsequently
written off. However,
he did not apply to the Board under reg 10 until on or
after 28 February 2025. That is because he did not realise immediately the
extent of his physical injuries.
need not determine whether I should extend time. Instead, I must determine
whether I have the power to extend time beyond six years.
I therefore have not
considered the evidence adduced and submissions made by the claimant as to why
time should be extended.
claimant submits that reg 10(3) and (4) allows the Tribunal to extend time
beyond six years. He relies on
Limitation Act 1974
(3) An action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty
(whether that duty exists by virtue of a contract or a provision
under an enactment or independently of any contract or any such provision),
where the damages claimed by the plaintiff
for the negligence, nuisance or
breach of duty consist of, or include, damages in respect of personal injuries
to any person, must
not be brought after the expiration of 3 years commencing on
the date of discoverability.
far as I can tell, he also submits that time runs from the date of
discoverability rather than the date of the motor
Consideration
Limitation Act
does not apply
is convenient to commence with the
Limitation Act
. On its face,
only to an “action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breath of
duty...” By
, ‘action’ “includes any proceedings
in a court of law”.
Notwithstanding
the inclusive definition of ‘action’ in the
Limitation Act
the submission that it extends to an application under reg 10. In interpreting
each Act, I start with its text whilst,
at the same time, having regard to its
context and purpose:

(2017) 262 CLR 362
[2017] HCA 34
(Kiefel CJ, Nettle and
Gordon JJ).
Tribunal is not a court of law, and this is not an action. Rather, the
Regulations and the Act pursuant to which they are made

) create a statutory entitlement to
compensation, called scheduled benefits. An application for scheduled benefits
is made pursuant
to reg 10, and such benefits are calculated in accordance with
is clear from the Regulations’ text that reg 10 prescribes exhaustively
the period within which to make a claim. So much
is apparent from the limitation
in reg 10(3) to extend time to not more than five years beyond the initial one
is also clear that time runs from the date of the accident: reg 10(2)(a). In

rule’s operation.
applies only to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the provision of
a relevant Act:
Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020
defines the
Motor Accidents (Liabilities and Compensation)
as a relevant Act.
conclude that r 11 is inconsistent with reg 10. I repeat that reg 10 addresses
exhaustively the limitation period within which to
make a claim. It expressly
provides a power to extend time, such power being limited to a period of five
years. In contrast, the
regulation in question in
QX v Mondelez Australia Pty
was silent as to extending time and therefore, I found at [22]-[32], not
inconsistent with r 11.
suggests, overwhelmingly, that r 11 is inconsistent with reg 10 and, therefore,
inapplicable.
conclude that the Tribunal does not have the power to extend time beyond six
years after the date of the motor accident. Because
the claimant requires an
extension of more than six years, granting any extension would be futile. It
follows that the referral itself
should be dismissed under s 89 of the TASCAT
Act on the basis that it is misconceived.
