Veterans’ Affairs
House of Representatives on 24 November 2016
Broad discretionary power—disclosure of
information
Schedule 2, items 1, 7 and 10,
proposed new sections 409A, 151B and 131A
Items 1, 7 and 10 of Schedule 2 insert a provision into each of the
Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004
Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988
Veterans’ Entitlement Act 1986
, respectively, that would enable the
Secretary to certify that it is necessary in the public interest to
‘disclose any information
obtained by any person in the performance of
that person’s duties [under the relevant Act] to such persons and for such
as the Secretary determines’.
The explanatory memorandum (at p. 11) provides examples of circumstances in
which it might be appropriate for the Secretary to disclose
information, such as
‘where there is a threat to life, health or welfare, for the enforcement
of laws, in relation to proceeds
of crime orders, mistakes of fact, research and
statistical analysis, APS code of conduct investigations, misinformation in the
and provider inappropriate practices’.
The statement of compatibility (at p. 4) notes that several safeguards have
been incorporated into the bill in relation to the disclosure
of information
under these provisions. These include that:
• the Secretary must act in accordance with rules the Minister makes
• the powers of the Minister and Secretary cannot be delegated to
anyone; and
• before disclosing personal information about a person, the Secretary
must notify the person, give the person a reasonable
opportunity to make written
comments on the proposed disclosure and consider any written comments made by
the person (if the Secretary
fails to comply with these requirements he or she
commits an offence).
The committee notes these safeguards, however it remains the case that there
is no limitation on the face of the bill in relation
to the breadth of the
Secretary’s power to certify that the disclosure of information is in the
public interest (other than
the notification requirement in relation to personal
information described above). While the Secretary must act in accordance with
any rules that the Minister makes about how the power is to be exercised there
is no requirement for the Minister to actually make
rules for this purpose.
The committee therefore seeks the Minister’s advice as to:
why (at least high-level) rules or guidance about the exercise of
the Secretary’s disclosure power cannot be included in the
legislation; and
why there is no duty on the Minister to make rules regulating the
exercise of the Secretary’s power (i.e. the committee seeks
advice as to
why the proposed subsections have been drafted to provide that the Minister
make these rules, rather than requiring that the Minister
make rules to guide the exercise of this significant power).
Pending the Minister’s reply, the committee draws Senators’
attention to the provisions, as they may be considered to
make rights, liberties
or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative
powers, in breach of principle
