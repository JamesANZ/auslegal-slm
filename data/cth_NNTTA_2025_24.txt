REASONS FOR DECISION
[1] Complete
Prospecting Pty Ltd has applied for the grant of two prospecting licences, which
of Western Australia considers to be acts attracting the
expedited procedure under the
Native Title Act
Wajarri Yamaji
Aboriginal Corporation RNTBC, being the relevant native
title party, objects to the application of the expedited procedure.
Tribunal’s role is to conduct an inquiry and determine whether or not the
expedited procedure applies:
Native Title Act
made directions for the conduct of the inquiry in these matters on 30 April 2025
and Wajarri Yamaji’s material was due to
be provided by 28 July 2025.
[3] Wajarri
Yamaji did not comply by the due date, nor did it seek any extension of time. On
4 August 2025, the Tribunal advised the
parties that the applications were at
risk of dismissal and allowed Wajarri Yamaji until 11 August 2025 to
provide reasons for its
failure to comply and request any further time.
[4] No response
was received and, other than lodging its applications and advising the details
of its representative, Wajarri Yamaji
has not communicated with the Tribunal or
participated in any part of the inquiry process.
[5] The Tribunal
may dismiss an objection application at any stage of the inquiry in
circumstances where the native title party fails
within a reasonable time to
proceed with the application or to comply with a direction of the Tribunal:
Native Title Act
. I am satisfied on the facts of these matters
that Wajarri Yamaji’s applications should be dismissed.
