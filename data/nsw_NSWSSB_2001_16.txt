The application for the stay of an order of the Tribunal is refused on the
grounds that the appellant has not discharged their onus
to show, on balance,
that an Adjudicator should exercise their discretion to make the order
REASONS FOR DECISION
THE APPLICATION
April 2001, the appellants lodged an appeal against orders
made by an Adjudicator requiring the owners corporation to provide the
respondents with a key to the storeroom attached to and forming part of their
It is the appellant's submission that the Interim order made on
9 April 2001
"is invalid in fact and in law
The appellants
allege that the respondent’s storeroom "
is actually a cage locker
inside a restricted the common property area with access being through the door
on common property
". They say that the common property area is "
area for plumbers and fire control and contains plumbing".
appellants claim that:
It is dangerous to allow unrestricted access to
this area. The [respondents] have previously left private belongings outside
cage storeroom restricting safe access to the plumbing
RESPONDENT’S SUBMISSION
There are no further submissions on behalf of the respondents, except those
contained in their application SA01/00204.
Section 180
Strata Schemes Management Act 1996
(the "Act")
provides that if a notice of appeal is accompanied by a request for a stay of
the operation of the order appealed against,
an Adjudicator may decide to stay
the operation of the order until the appeal is determined.
The appellant has requested that a stay be granted and therefore has the onus of
proving that considerations apply such that the
stay should be granted prior to
the appeal being dealt with by the tribunal.
In the order dated 9 April 2001, the Adjudicator identified that:
"Is apparent from the copy of the title document attached that a storeroom
forms part of lot 115. Request for an interim order for
a key to facilitate
display of the storeroom for purposes of sale is not unreasonable. It is
puzzling as to why the executive committee
with change locks or have the power
to do so with respecting
) non common property."
The Adjudicator found that the applicants in that application were the owners of
that part of the Lot. According to their submission
they had, for the past four
and half years, had access to the storeroom for which they had their own set of
The application for a stay is not accompanied by any evidence that disproves the
findings made on an interim basis, by the Adjudicator.
Although the appellant
claims that the interim order is invalid, no submissions are made as to the
nature of the invalidity, nor
is it contested that the storeroom is not part of
the respondent’s title.
The appellants’ claim that a danger is created by allowing the respondents
unrestricted access to this area because of the
existence of plumbing and fire
control equipment, which is located in this area. However, the appellant has
not identified any history
of incidents that have resulted from the respondents
enjoying such access for a period of four and a half years. The appellant has
also identified that there is a security guard that is able to provide
twenty-four hours a day supervision of this area.
The appellant also does not identify any particular detriment it will suffer if
the orders made are not stayed prior to a full hearing
of the appeal, even if
they may ultimately be successful.
On the grounds identified above, I therefore refuse to exercise a discretion to
grant a stay in this matter prior to the appeal being
dealt with by the
