the complainant
) applied to the former
Attorney General, the Hon John Quigley MLA (
Attorney General
) under the

the FOI Act
access to documents between named individuals, including the Attorney General of

decision, provided to the complainant on 22 September 2023, the Attorney General
refused the complainant access to two
documents (t
he disputed documents
on the ground they were exempt under clause 7(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act
clause 7(1)
On 28 September 2023, the complainant applied to
the Information Commissioner (
Commissioner
) for external review of the
Attorney General’s decision and provided submissions claiming the disputed
documents were not exempt
as claimed. The Attorney General provided the
Commissioner with his FOI file maintained in respect of the access application,
with a copy of the disputed documents.
On 10 January 2025, one
of the Commissioner’s officers provided the complainant with her
assessment of the matter. It was the
officer’s assessment that the
Commissioner was likely to consider, based on the information then before her,
that the disputed
documents are exempt under clause 7(1).
The complainant
did not accept the assessment and requested that the Commissioner provide a
decision on the matter. The complainant
reiterated its submissions provided
with its application for external review.
Clause 7(1) provides that
matter is exempt if it would be privileged from production in legal proceedings
on the ground of legal professional
privilege. The grounds upon which a document
is subject to legal professional privilege are fairly well settled in Australian
In brief, legal professional privilege protects from
disclosure confidential communications between clients and their legal advisers,
if those communications were made for the dominant purpose of giving or
obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services,
representation in proceedings in a court:
Esso Australia Resources Ltd v
Federal Commissioner of Taxation
[1999] HCA 67
(1999) 201 CLR 49
The disputed documents consisted of an email to the Attorney General
from the Solicitor General, with an attachment, described as
the Attorney General’.
The Commissioner examined the disputed
documents and considered the submissions made by the parties and the applicable
law in relation
to legal professional privilege. The Commissioner was satisfied
that the disputed documents were confidential communications between
Attorney General and his legal adviser made for the dominant purpose of giving
or obtaining legal advice or the provision of
legal services, as described in
As a result, the Commissioner was satisfied that the
disputed documents would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on
the ground of legal professional privilege and that they were, therefore, exempt
under clause 7(1).
The complainant submitted that consideration should
be given to whether legal professional privilege had been waived. The
Commissioner
noted that her role in deciding whether documents are exempt under
clause 7(1) is restricted to a consideration of whether they would
their face, privileged from production in legal proceedings:
Department of
Housing and Works v Bowden
[2005] WASC 123.
As a result, it was not open to
the Commissioner to consider the question of waiver.
The complainant
contended that consideration should be given to whether disclosure of the
disputed documents was in the public interest.
Under the FOI Act, legal
professional privilege is an absolute exemption, and no public interest test
arises in respect of clause
7(1). Therefore, the Commissioner noted that
it was not open to her to consider the public interest.
The complainant
also argued that consideration should be given to whether access could be given
to an edited copy of the disputed
documents with the exempt matter deleted,
pursuant to section 24 of the FOI Act. As the Commissioner was satisfied the
documents are exempt in their entirety, she considered it was not
practicable for the Attorney General to give access to a copy of
the disputed
documents with the exempt matter deleted: Scott J in
Police Force of Western
Australia v Winterton
(Unreported, Supreme Court of WA, Library No 970646,
27 November 1997), at page 16. As a result, the Commissioner considered that
the obligation under section 24 did not apply.
The Commissioner found
that the disputed documents were exempt under clause 7(1) and confirmed the
Attorney General’s
