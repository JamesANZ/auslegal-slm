from a unit trust to a unit holder
Revenue Ruling SD.103
Replaced by Revenue Ruling SD.106
This ruling is withdrawn and replaced by SD.106.
Taxpayers and practitioners are advised that it has
no past application.
Exemption 6 of Heading IV(A) of the Third
Schedule (exemption 6) to the
Stamps Act 1958
(the Act) and exemption 10 of Heading VI of the
Third Schedule to the Act (exemption 10) provide
exemption from stamp duty where marketable
securities and real property respectively are
transferred or conveyed from the trustee of a trust
to a beneficiary of that trust, provided that certain
conditions are satisfied.
The purpose of this ruling is to clarify the
application of these exemptions.
Ralara Pty Ltd v Comptroller of Stamps (Vic)
(1992) 24 ATR 1113
it was held that exemption 10
applied only where the transferee received the
property in the capacity of a beneficiary of the trust.
Exemption 10 was held not to apply where there
was a sale to the beneficiary (or consideration for
the transfer).
Exemptions 6 and 10 do not apply where there is a
transfer of marketable securities or real property
from the trustee of a unit trust to a unit holder as
the unit holder is not considered to be a beneficiary
for the purpose of these exemptions. In such cases
the transfer to the unit holder is made in
satisfaction of his/her unit holding. Accordingly,
the transferee does not receive the property in the
capacity of a beneficiary as there is consideration
for the transfer. Such transfers therefore attract

law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual case
having regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings
must be read subject to Ruling Gen.01.
