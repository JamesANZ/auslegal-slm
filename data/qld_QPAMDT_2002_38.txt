Randell, Mark & Cridge, Kim v The Pines Realty Pty Ltd (now) Stemp Pty
Ltd & Stemp, Allan
[2002] QPAMDT 38
REASONS FOR DECISION:
On 18 February 2000, the applicants paid
to The Pines Realty Pty Ltd, trading as Pines Realty the sum of $900.00, which
sum included
an amount of $720.00 for a bond for premises at 2/92 Bienvenue
Drive Currumbin Waters, which they were to commence renting from 19
2000 until 18 August 2000.
Pines Realty should have paid the bond to
the Residential Tenancies Authority (“the RTA”). That did not occur
seems that the bond was misappropriated.
Upon becoming aware of that occurrence in
August 2000, the applicants notified the RTA on 18 August 2000. In October 2000
was investigated by the Department of Tourism, Racing and Fair Trading
(“the Department”). The applicants formally lodged
a claim with the
Department on 30 May 2001. They said at the hearing that they simply filled out
the forms when
they were received from the
Department.
By virtue of Section 119 of the
Auctioneers and Agents Act, the applicants had relevantly 6 months from when
they became aware of
their loss to make a claim. The formal claim was out of
time by some months, although the Department had fully investigated the claim
within the six months notice period.
Section 604(2) of The Property Agents and
Motor Dealers Act 2000 (“the Act”) which commenced on 1 July 2001
permits continuation
of unfinalised claims against the fund. Section 510
enables the Tribunal to extend the time for making a claim if application is
made in that regard. Having received a letter from the Department advising them
that the claim was out of time, the applicants made
application to the Tribunal
for an extension of time to make the claim.
The applicants were uncertain about the
date on which they received the letter from the Department advising them that
the claim was
out of time and that application should be made to the Tribunal
within 14 days of receipt of the letter. They informed the Tribunal
they received the letter some weeks after it was apparently sent. I resolve any
uncertainty in favour of the applicants.
I have had regard to the provisions of
Section 511(1)(b) of the Act. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to extend
time having regard
(i) the reason the
applicants did not make a claim was that they had immediately, and therefore
within the six months notice period,
informed the RTA and the Department of
their loss and the claim had been investigated within the six months notice
(ii) the application is made in circumstances in which no person is
disadvantaged by the late claim and it was fully investigated
by the Department
within the six month notice period; and
(iii) an extension of time would
place no hardship on the respondents who have been aware of the claim since at
least October 2000
well within the six month notice period, whereas a refusal to
extend time would place hardship on innocent applicants who immediately
the loss they had sustained; and
(iv) the justice of the matter generally
requires that the extension of time be granted.
