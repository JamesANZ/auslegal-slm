discontinuance of weekly payments of income support following the prior
acceptance of a claim for compensation under the
(the Act) can have profound consequences for workers and their families, and
“[if] the determination to discontinue turns out
to be incorrect, the
later reinstatement of weekly payments, even with interest, might not adequately
redress the consequences of
discontinuance.”
has recognised this by providing for the automatic initial suspension of the
decision in prescribed circumstances and thereafter
by granting the Tribunal the
power in prescribed circumstances to further suspend the operation of the
decision. This application
concerns whether the Tribunal should exercise that
power and order a further suspension. In deciding that issue the Tribunal must
apply s 48(9)(b) of the Act. It provides the Tribunal may as it thinks fit,
and from time to time, and after having regard to the
nature and circumstances
of the case-
(i) further suspend the
operation of the decision (from time to time) to allow a reasonable opportunity
for resolution of the dispute
by conciliation or determination if such action is
reasonably necessary in order to avoid undue financial hardship being suffered
by the worker and subject to the principle that
the Tribunal should give extra weight to taking action under this
subparagraph if
it appears to the Tribunal that it is reasonably open
to the worker to dispute the relevant decision;
(ii) vary or revoke a decision under subparagraph (i), including so as to
provide that weekly payments will only continue, or continue
reduced rate, if the worker complies with conditions determined by
the Tribunal;
(iii) make an order for the payment of an amount to represent some or all of
any weekly payments that have not been made to
during the period of the dispute.
determination dated 24 July 2025, the Return to Work Corporation of South
Australia (the Corporation) resolved to invoke the power
of discontinuance
provided by s 48 of the Act to discontinue the weekly payments of income support
that it was paying Cledismar Zabala
Herrera. It did so by reference to s
48(2)(b) of the Act, based upon the opinion of the occupational physician, Dr
Hwang, that Ms
Herrara was no longer incapacitated as a result of a work injury
that the Corporation had previously accepted as compensable.
Ms Herrara filed an application seeking a review of that decision in a timely
way, her weekly payments continued until her
application came before a
Commissioner. At that time Ms Herrara made an application to the Commissioner
for the suspension of the
decision to discontinue to remain in place and on 26
September 2025, the Commissioner acceded to that request. In her reasons for
doing so, the Commissioner said:
In my view, the applicant has met the entry requirements of section 48(9) of the
RTW Act, and the issue to be determined here now
is whether the Tribunal, having
regard to the nature and circumstances of the case, should further suspend the
operation of the discontinuance
decision as it is reasonably necessary in order
to avoid undue financial hardship being suffered by the applicant while allowing
an opportunity for resolution of the dispute by conciliation. I note that extra
weight should be given, if it appears to the Tribunal
that it is reasonably open
to the worker to dispute the relevant decision.
On the information currently available, it appears as though the applicant is a
vulnerable person. English is not her first language,
and she requires the
assistance of an interpreter. I am informed that a litigation guardian may need
to be appointed. The applicant
has reported a history of a significant
psychological condition and has previously self harmed. She has also reported
support of her parent and being required to leave the house she was
living in pre-injury.
The applicant’s average weekly earnings have been calculated at $746.08
gross per week. A modest figure. She has provided a
screenshot of a transaction
bank account, which shows a modest balance as at 2 September 2025. She has
listed expenses including
rent, food, phone, car repayments, etc. These are all
common expenses, with nothing unusual.
I was initially concerned by the lack of documentation supplied by the
applicant, however on reflection I considered that the language
difficulties,
capacity issues, and personal circumstances of the applicant may make the quick
provision of these documents trickier
than in other matters. Although there were
no documents to verify the amounts referenced in these expenses, there were no
which seemed exorbitant or outside the expected range. The applicant
asserts that she will experience undue financial hardship if
payments are not
continued to allow for conciliation.
In my view, it is appropriate to deal with the application to suspend the
operation of the discontinuance determination informally
and proportionately.
For this reason, I suspend the operation of the discontinuance determination for
the period from when information
through to when the matter is next before the Tribunal. This is a period of
approximately
4 weeks, with further application then being required to extend
Given this case involves a difference in medical opinion as to the nature and
extent of the applicant’s incapacity for work,
and about the nature and
diagnoses of her work injury(ies), it would appear reasonably open to the
applicant to dispute the discontinuance
determination and seek a determination
as to which medical opinion should be preferred.
the making of this order, the matter was referred for judicial determination at
which time the Corporation indicated that
it opposed the further suspension of
its decision to discontinue.
preserve the status quo, I further suspended the decision to discontinue and set
the matter down for argument.
support of her request for the suspension to continue, Ms Herrera, through her
lawyers, put forward a Work Capacity Certificate
dated 10 October 2025, issued
by Dr Joshua Kartika, which stated that she remains fit only for suitable duties
from 9 October 2025
to 31 October 2025. She also put forward a copy of her bank
statement that indicates that the modest weekly payments that she is
of $746.08 per week, barely cover her weekly expenses. Her counsel submitted
that she has little if any savings and that
if weekly payments are stopped, even
if she is eligible for social security payments, these would not be sufficient
for her to cover
her weekly expenses.
counsel took me to other information that indicates that Ms Herrera is a
vulnerable person. She has a mental illness that has resulted
in the appointment
of a litigation guardian. English is not her first language. She has a history
of self-harm and recently was referred
to the Lyell McEwin Hospital as a result
of self-harming. She does not have close family supports that are consistent or
was submitted that Ms Herrera continues to engage with treatment, comply with
medical recommendations, provide updated medical
evidence and continues to
engage in return to work efforts. It was argued that maintaining the suspension
would enable her to continue
necessary rehabilitation without causing undue
financial hardship and promote a return to work.
Corporation did not oppose the suspension outright, but expressed concern about
what it said was inadequate evidence to establish
economic hardship. I also
understood it to contend that there was a serious question as to whether any
alleged ongoing incapacity
for work was due to the accepted work place injury.
It should be noted that the employer has independently challenged the
Corporation’s
acceptance of the claim. It suggested some form of interim
order pending receipt of further information. The employer supported that
immediately struck me about this case is that there are already multiple
disputes before the Tribunal involving multiple parties
in respect of a claim
involving weekly payments of $746.08 per week. As the matter proceeded, I
expressed concern that the overall
legal expenses could quickly exceed that
gross aggregate of weekly payments at stake. The case involves conflicting
medical evidence
against a background of a significant non-work related medical
condition. It seemed to me that the most expeditious way forward was
legal skirmishes on hold for the time being, and to focus on exploring a
negotiated outcome. I therefore suggested a prompt
settlement conference and for
the suspension to remain in place until that occurs, with a view that if the
matter does not resolve,
the issue of further suspension would be referred to
another member. None of the parties vigorously opposed that course and I made
orders accordingly.
