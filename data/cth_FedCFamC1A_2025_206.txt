REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
AUSTIN, HARTNETT & CURRAN JJ:
reasons explain the dismissal of an application for leave to appeal from an
order made on 29 May 2025 by a judge of the Federal
Circuit and Family Court of
Australia (Division 1), which order dismissed the applicant’s fresh
parenting application due to
failure to satisfy the requirements of
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) (“the Act”).
parties’ only child was born in 2014 and is now 11 years old. He has been
the subject of litigation between the parties
since 2017.
orders were made between the parties, supposedly to finally resolve their
dispute, on three prior occasions in May 2018,
May 2019, and February 2022. The
latter of those orders relevantly provided for the applicant to have sole
parental responsibility
for the child and for the child to live with the parties
for equivalent (but not equal) time (at [4] and [19]), which orders were
substantially the same as the first orders made in May 2018 (at [5] and [14]).
The second suite of orders made in May 2019 only governed
the school the child
must attend.
applicant commenced proceedings for a fourth time in April 2024. He wanted to
retain sole parental responsibility for the child
but reduce the time which the
child spends with the respondent from six nights per fortnight to one night per
fortnight, though with
school holidays still shared equally (at [33]). The
respondent countered in July 2024, seeking reversal of the child’s primary
residence and her acquisition of sole parental responsibility for him (at [44]).
She proposed that the child spend time with the
applicant on alternate weekends
and for one-half of all school holidays (at [46]). The Independent
Children’s Lawyer (“the
ICL”) ultimately advocated for
retention of the orders last made in February 2022 (at [48]–[49]).
the trial, the applicant envisaged instead seeking orders providing for the
child to make his own decisions about seeing the
respondent until 2026 (at
[34]), but his proposal was posited in a form which was entirely aspirational
and unenforceable because
it hinged upon whether or not the respondent
“engages with external support” (whatever that may mean).
hearing of the new dispute proceeded over five days between March and May 2025.
Judgment was reserved for a few weeks and pronounced
on 29 May 2025. His Honour
decided to dismiss the parties’ respective applications to vary the orders
made in February 2022
due to their failure to show any material change of
circumstances (at [122]), though the decision was made at the conclusion of the
trial rather than as a preliminary determination (at [56]). His Honour was
unconvinced the parties’ proposals would resolve
or abate the problems
they had encountered in effectively implementing the existing orders (at [114]),
which problems were not induced
by the orders but by the parties themselves (at
[117]–[121]).
Honour dismissed the parties’ respective parenting applications (Orders 1
and 2), affirmed the last orders made in February
2022 would remain in full
force and effect (Order 3), and discharged the ICL (Order 4).
applicant sought leave to appeal from Orders 1 and 3.
LEAVE TO APPEAL
dismissal order (Order 1) was made pursuant to
of the Act.
order dismissing a parenting application is not a “child-related
order” and is interlocutory in nature, so leave to
appeal from it is

(2024) FLC 94-232
[98]–[104]).
grant of leave to appeal ordinarily requires the applicant to show the decision
at first instance is attended by sufficient doubt
to warrant appellate scrutiny
and, additionally, substantial injustice would result if leave were refused,
supposing the decision
at first instance to be wrong (
Medlow & Medlow
(2016) FLC 93-692 at [44]–[57]).
the following discussion of the intended grounds of appeal reveals, there is no
reason to doubt the efficacy of the decision so
leave to appeal should be
APPLICATION IN THE APPEAL
14 October 2025, the applicant filed an Application in an Appeal seeking
permission to do three things: file an Amended Notice
of Appeal, file an Amended
Summary of Argument, and adduce further evidence in the appeal.
applicant relied upon his affidavit filed on 14 October 2025 in support of the
application.
the proximity of the appeal hearing, the application was adjourned to the same
day as the appeal. Having heard from the applicant,
he was permitted to rely
upon the Amended Notice of Appeal and the Amended Summary of Argument, both of
which were annexed to his
affidavit. There was no prejudice to the respondent,
because she did not actively participate in the appeal, nor to the ICL, who
filed a Submitting Notice.
applicant is refused permission to adduce further evidence though. The documents
upon which he wished to rely were available at
the hearing before the primary
(1998) 197 CLR 172 at [55], [111], [114], [116] and
[186(9)]). His Honour rejected some of them when tendered at the hearing so,
the evidentiary ruling is shown to be wrong (and it was not), the
inadmissible evidence could not now be received.
23 amended grounds of appeal contend for legal error (Ground 2), factual error
(Grounds 4(a), 4(c), 4(d), 5, 7 and 8), and discretionary
error (Grounds 1, 3,
4, 4(b), 6, 9, 9(a), 9(b), 9(c), 9(d), 10(a), 10(b), 11, 12, 13 and 14), but are
not usefully illuminated by
the applicant’s Amended Summary of Argument,
which runs to 58 pages in length. In oral submissions, the applicant abandoned
Grounds 10(a) and 10(b).
arguments advanced by the applicant within it are an impenetrable barrage of
repetitive and disorganised complaints about the
misapplication of legal
principles and the mistreatment of the evidence. There is only so much an
appellate court can do to save
an applicant from the disadvantage of his or her
own obfuscation (

Legal error (Ground 2)
2 alleges the primary judge erred by not considering
s 65DAAA(3)
since the parties both asserted some form of variation of the February 2022
orders was required, even though they sought
quite different outcomes.
the fresh proceedings were commenced in April 2024, the impediment to the
further litigation imposed by
of the Act was a prominent feature.
11 June 2024, a registrar made this notation to procedural
directions:
The parties were pressed as to whether the reconsideration of final parenting
orders pursuant to
section 65DAAA
of [the Act] is in dispute as it affects the
listing before the Senior Judicial Registrar and any possible appointment of an
The Court was informed that it appears that
section 65DAAA
is not likely
to be in dispute and it is on that basis that the Judicial Registrar ordered the
appointment of an [ICL] and the listing

18 July 2024, another registrar made this notation to procedural
directions:
is consent that pursuant to s 655DAAA(3) [sic] of [the Act] the orders of [the
primary judge] made 10 February 2024 should be
re-considered.
neither party wanted
of the Act to impede the consideration of their
respective applications to vary the existing orders.
of the Act provides this:
(3) Despite subsection (1), the court may reconsider a final parenting order
with the agreement or consent of all the parties to
that order.
terminology is clear enough – the Court
reconsider a final
parenting order if the parties consent. The Court is not
so. His Honour was not persuaded to vary the existing orders, which decision did
of the Act.
applicant’s underlying complaint is that the primary judge failed to find
there had been a material change in circumstances
to warrant revision of the
existing orders. The primary judge found there had been no
“significant” change in circumstances
(at [122]) – that being
the first step in the analytical process
(s 65DAAA(1)(a))
– which finding
was open because the parties each promulgated an outcome under which the child
would live with one party (who
would have sole parental responsibility for him)
and spend time with the other party. Adjustments to the amount of time the child
would spend with the non-residential parent would not fix the problem the
parties encountered in exchanging the child between them.
enough, the child’s intermittent refusal to spend time with the respondent
was a new development, but the applicant proposed
new orders which still obliged
the child to spend time with the respondent (at least from 2026), so his
proposal was not a solution
to the problem. His Honour relevantly observed this:
there was no evidence to suggest that “a simple change of regime”
would resolve the problems encountered by the parties when implementing the
orders made in February 2022 (at [114], [117] and [119]);
the respondent was not
to blame for the child’s defiance, as the applicant had alleged (at
[116]); the problems encountered
by the parties would be the same regardless of
whether the orders required the child to spend two, six or 12 nights per
with the respondent (at [117]); it was not the role of the Court to
parent the parties’ child (at [118]); and the existing
regime gives
“a structure and scaffold for successful relationships” (at
Honour also found the child’s best interests were promoted by retention of
the existing orders (at [121]), so the applicant
fell at the second step
65DAAA(1)(b))
even if not at the first.
Mistaken findings (Grounds 4, 4(a), 4(c), 4(d), 5, 7 and
4 alleges it was not open to the primary judge to summarily dismiss the views
expressed by the child.
and foremost, his Honour did not “summarily dismiss” the
child’s views but did explain why no probative weight
was attributed to
his views (at [108]). The respondent and the child’s psychologist gave
evidence of the child’s vacillating
views (at [79] and [97]) so there was
evidence upon which the primary judge could legitimately make this finding:
place no weight on the variable views and preferences expressed by [the child].
His cognitive disabilities have been recognised.
His diagnosis of Oppositional
Defiance Disorder most probably permeates any statements of wish on preference
that he makes. There
has been no consistency in any preference stated by him as
to his living and parenting arrangements. He will on occasion say he prefers
live with [the respondent] and soon thereafter refuse to transit to her.
if it be accepted the child consistently expressed a desire to live with the
applicant, as the applicant contended, that was
precisely why the applicant
wanted no change made to the residence order, so from his perspective, there was
no change in circumstances
to warrant any variation of the residence order. What
the child said from time to time about his residential preference was therefore
immaterial.
Furthermore,
even if it be accepted the child consistently expressed the desire to not even
spend time with the respondent, the evidence
of such view was immaterial because
the applicant still wanted orders made compelling the child to do so. In that
regard the primary
judge said this:
each of these parents now advocates a mirror proposal for [the child] living
with that parent and spending alternate weekends
and school holidays with the
other (albeit that the [applicant] presents a more complicated proposal
involving graduated time and
travel for [the child] frequently to Europe), no
evidence is given or adduced of any probity to suggest that a simple change of
will attend to or resolve the issues confronting the parents and [the
child]. To the contrary, such proposals are highly likely to
impact on the
relationships for [the child] with each of his parents. Put simply, one parent
will become the “visiting parent”
and the other the “primary
parent” where [the child] would inevitably be exposed to and influenced by
that parent’s
particular personality and style to the exclusion of the
other whereas ideally, with the current orders, [the child] should have
benefit of a breadth and diversity of parenting styles which again is an
opportunity not available to all children of separated
each of the parents here now argue for primary care with traditional weekend and
holiday time with the other parent, their cases
each implicitly direct blame for
their current woes on the orders from February 2022 providing time for [the
child] on a 6/8 basis
between the parents. The evidence, however, suggests
otherwise and is now identified by the ICL. It is not the regime of orders which
cause the difficulties. Indeed, it is abundantly clear that a change in the
regime towards either of the parent’s current proposals
will not cure or
resolve the current difficulties. Put simply, and for whatever reason, the
parents, the school, and now this Court
are confronted with a 10 year old child
who appears to thrive on his diagnosis of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. The
[applicant]
says that [the child] refuses to go to the [respondent]. However, in
reality, [the child] refuses to go to the [respondent] when
the [applicant]
tells him but hours later will then demand to go to [the respondent]. This
situation will occur whether he lives
with [the respondent] for 6 nights per
fortnight or 2 nights per fortnight. Similarly, [the child] absconds from [the
respondent’s]
Undoubtedly he does this to challenge the authority of [the respondent].
will occur regardless of whether he lives with [the respondent] for 2 nights per
fortnight, 6 nights per fortnight, or 12 nights
per fortnight. I am told and
accept that changeovers directly between the parents occurring at the relatively
remote [location] proceed
generally without incident. To the contrary, a simple
changeover at the child’s school when under the scrutiny of and authority
of his teachers, habitually fails. It is the very essence of the personalities,
diverse as they are, of these parents to each look
for blame the other than with
themselves. Each of their parenting styles lacks any form of authority.
Unfortunately, the evidence
from [the child’s] school principal similarly
demonstrates that this child is empowered and entitled by any lack of adult
4(a) alleges the primary judge wrongly concluded the child had “cognitive
disabilities” (at [108]). The child has
been diagnosed with Oppositional
Defiance Disorder (at [45], [54], [98] and [102]) and the parties mutually
conducted the case on
the premise his mental health was fragile (at
[92]–[93], [96] and [101]). Whether the child’s delicate
psychological
state is properly described as a “cognitive” issue is
not to the point.
4(c) and 4(d) allege the primary judge wrongly found the child had occasionally
expressed inconsistent preferences about with
whom he wished to live (at [108]
and [116]) and Ground 5 alleges the primary judge was wrong to find there were
no discernible reasons
for the child’s refusals to spend time with the
respondent, nor for the inconsistency of his behaviour in that regard (at
[103]–[104]).
the findings did have a foundation in the evidence. There was clear evidence of
the child’s changing attitude, but no
evidence at all of him giving
reasons for his occasional refusal to spend time with the respondent. The
respondent said the child
was inconsistent (at [79]). The applicant’s
former partner gave evidence of how the child “continued to flip back and
forth between willingness and unwillingness” (at [87]). The child’s
psychologist gave evidence of the child’s “varied
wishes and views
as to his living arrangements” (at [97]). Such evidence was put to the
applicant, who was unable to explain
the child’s inconsistent behaviour
7 alleges the primary judge wrongly found the child has a loving and bonded
relationship with the respondent (at [116]), which
is an extraordinary claim for
the applicant to maintain when he contrarily submitted this to the primary
With regard to [the respondent], [the child] has made consistent statement to
the [applicant] and [the applicant’s former partner]
that he loves [the
respondent], misses [the respondent].
(Applicant’s Summary of Argument filed 24 March 2025, paragraph 76)
8 alleges the primary judge wrongly found the respondent was honest. His Honour
found the respondent to be “genuine and
honest”, as was the finding
made in respect of the applicant (at [83]). That the applicant could point to
some inconsistencies
in the respondent’s evidence does not prove her
dishonesty. Witnesses can make mistakes without the error being deliberate
Discretionary errors (Grounds 1, 3, 4(b), 6, 9, 9(a), 9(b),
9(c), 9(d), 11, 12, 13 and 14)
these grounds are complaints of the primary judge failing to consider, either
properly or at all, various aspects of the evidence.
expectation harboured by the applicant that each of the sub-grounds and
particulars will be parsed and intricately analysed is
misconceived. Complaints
the evidence, as most of
these complaints are characterised, are really
correctly construed as only “weight” complaints and are incompetent
the absence of a ground of appeal alleging the “judgment” was
manifestly unreasonable (
House v The King
(1936) 55 CLR 499
Hedlund & Hedlund
[2021] FedCFamC1A 84
(2021) FLC 94-065
[36]–[37]).
Ground 1 does allege the finding there had been no significant change in
circumstances was “plainly wrong”, that
complaint must be rejected
for reasons already canvassed. Neither party proposed any variation to the
existing orders which would
fix the problem they had encountered in exchanging
the child for him to spend time with the respondent.
holistically, the applicant’s grievance appears to be that, since the
orders made in February 2022 had been breaking
down due to the child’s
refusal to spend time with the respondent, the primary judge was obliged to find
there had been a material
change in circumstances which warranted variation of
the existing orders. The complaint misses the point because the remedy proposed
by the applicant was just more of the same.
enough, the applicant proposed reducing the amount of time the child spends with
the respondent, but he still proposed orders
which compelled the child to spend
time with the respondent as frequently as he already does under the existing
orders – once
per fortnight. The applicant’s proposal for new orders
did not reduce the number of times the child would need to be exchanged
them – only to shorten the duration of the fortnightly visits. The failure
to implement the existing orders was attributable
to the parties’ failure
to cooperate (at [107], [111]–[112] and [121]). The child is evidently
attuned to the parental
conflict and feels “empowered and entitled”
to act as he pleases due to the lack of adult authority (at [105], [107]
[117]–[118]). The problem would not be solved just by reducing the amount
of time the child must spend with the respondent.
applicant’s contentions about the respondent’s propensity for family
violence and the threat she thereby poses to
the child’s safety (advanced
under Grounds 6, 9, 9(b) and 9(d)) are rejected. The applicant ran a case that
the child should
spend time with the respondent each fortnight and for one-half
of all school holidays. He could not sensibly make that proposal and
simultaneously maintain the child’s safety was at risk in the
respondent’s care.
applicant’s complaint of the primary judge giving insufficient
consideration to the opinion evidence of the Court Child
Expert (advanced under
Ground 3) is rejected for two reasons. First, the primary judge accepted the
ICL’s proposal to retain
the existing orders based on the opinion evidence
given by the Court Child Expert (at [49]–[50]). Secondly, the Court is not
bound to accept and act on the opinion evidence of an expert witness (
[2002] HCA 36
(2002) 211 CLR 238
Albert & Plowman
[2020] FamCAFC 23
other grounds are inconsequential. They variously complain of the primary judge
not giving sufficient attention to: the child’s
diagnosis (Ground 4(b)),
the respondent’s alleged contravention and frustration of existing orders
(Grounds 9(a) and 12), the
respondent’s alleged deficient supervision of
the child (Ground 9(c)), the applicant’s submissions (Ground 11), the
citizenship (Ground 13), and the child’s cultural needs
(Ground 14).
DISPOSITION
application for leave to appeal is refused.
applicant sought a costs certificate under the
Federal Proceedings (Costs)
(Cth) to cover his disbursements of $307.61, but his application is
dismissed. There is no power to grant a costs certificate to an
appellant unless
the appeal succeeds on a question of law. Here, there was no error of law and no
leave to appeal was granted.
