was accommodated in a maximum security facility at the Arthur Gorrie
Correctional Centre from 2 June 2005 until 1 August 2006.
Between these dates
female prisoners (and other classes of prisoners) could not be classified as
maximum security prisoners and therefore
could not be accommodated in such a
may be assumed for present purposes that X would have been treated more
favourably by not being accommodated in a maximum security
although he would be the subject of significant restrictions depending upon his
behaviour and other matters even
if accommodated elsewhere in the corrections
system. The State’s case is as follows. X, had he wished, could have
his classification as a maximum security prisoner but did not do so.
In truth there is nothing to suggest he was not properly classified.
circumstances of male and female prisoners are not the same – the location
of segregated correctional facility, and the
needs and offender profiles are
different. The female prison population is 7% of the total prison population
– making it not
feasible to have separate maximum security units for
female prisoners. There is in any event no perceived current need for same
because of the systems capacity to deal with such prisoners in a different
environment.
or not a person is classified as a maximum security prisoner depends upon that
person meeting the criteria set out in s.47
Corrective Services
(Qld) which does not require the person to be of a
particular gender. It is only if a female person meets the criteria that an
(which is beneficial to them but not the male applicant) would see
them not placed in a maximum security facility although subject
security conditions. This is for the benefit of those female prisoners and is
prima facie not unlawful (s.104
Anti-Discrimination Act
State’s case appears fairly arguable.
or not some unidentified female prisoners should be classified “maximum
security” X does not challenge his security
assessment – he merely
points to the arguable premise that having those characteristics he, if female,
would have been otherwise
accommodated. That may not occasion him loss in the
relevant legal sense when, wherever females were accommodated, he would not
accommodated.
of the above propositions are matters of legal rather than detailed factual
argument. X in my view does not require any more
facilities than provided to
any other prisoner seeking to represent himself in a judicial or quasi judicial
forum to meet the State’s
do not think it proper in the above circumstances to make special orders as to
special facilities other than as already provided.
direct X to file a response to the State’s Contentions filed on 22 May
2009, within twenty-eight days or such longer period
as the Registrar directs.
the reasons set out in my orders of 29 April 2009, I confirm and continue the
order previously made prohibiting disclosure of
the identity of the
complainant.
