‘WHAT WORLD ARE WE IMAGINING?’: COUNTERFACTUAL
REASONING AND THE ‘BUT FOR’ TEST IN
LEWIS V ACT
SAMUEL CASTAN
Counterfactual causal analysis raises fundamental philosophical questions
with far-reaching practical implications for the assessment
of compensatory
damages. Australian courts frequently skirt around this vexed issue rather than
pursuing a coherent, principled approach.
The High Court has recently provided
much-needed practical guidance on the operation of counterfactuals and the
test. This case note examines Lewis v Australian Capital
Territory (‘Lewis’), in which the High Court reaffirmed the
centrality of counterfactuals and the ‘but for’ test to the
assessment of compensatory damages. This case note canvasses
the facts of Lewis,
analyses the High Court’s application of counterfactual causal reasoning
to give effect to the fundamental
compensatory principle, and examines the
competing ‘but for’ and ‘material contribution’ causal
tests. This
case note draws parallels between Lewis (a false imprisonment claim)
and Berry v CCL Secure Pty Ltd (a misleading conduct claim),
arguing that the
two cases (handed down on the same day) are an unambiguous indication from the
High Court that Australian courts
should apply counterfactual reasoning when
calculating loss, subject to certain exceptional circumstances where the
test malfunctions. This case note also addresses the High
Court’s sensible rejection in Lewis of the availability of substantial
‘vindicatory damages’ in the absence of loss.
I INTRODUCTION
Counterfactual analysis is a frequent feature of Australian litigation, yet
difficulties arise from the ‘indeterminacy of meaning’
intrinsic to
the ‘but for’ (or
sine qua non
The ‘but for’
test requires an assumption that those applying it ‘share an ability to
specify some definite possible
world that is “similar” to our actual
world save that in that world the defendant did not do what she did in the
It is easier
said than done to craft a hypothetical in which no fact or circumstance is
changed except the wrongful act.
Professor Moore provides a useful practical illustration of this difficulty:
Suppose a defendant negligently destroyed a life preserver and a sailor
drowns for want of one. When we say ‘[b]ut for the defendant’s
of destroying the life preserver’,
what world are we imagining
We know we are to eliminate the defendant’s act, but what are we to
replace it with? A life preserver that was, alternatively,
destroyed by the
heavy seas? A defendant who didn’t destroy the life preserver because she
had already pushed the victim overboard
when no one else was around to throw the
life preserver to the victim? And so on and so
Lewis v Australian Capital Territory
the High Court squarely confronted this practical and
metaphysical
quandary in the
context of a false imprisonment claim. In four separate sets of reasons, their
Honours engaged in a detailed analysis
of counterfactuals, unanimously
dismissing an appeal from the Court of Appeal of the Australian Capital
Territory (‘ACT’).
Gageler J, Gordon J and Edelman J held that the appellant, Mr Lewis, was not
entitled to compensatory damages because,
his unlawful
imprisonment, he would have been imprisoned lawfully and so suffered no
Kiefel CJ and Keane J held
that the appeal should fail on an anterior point, namely that Mr Lewis’
liberty was already so qualified
by his sentence and the relevant Act that he
suffered no loss.
The Court also

substantial ‘vindicatory damages’
or ‘substantial damages to
vindicate a right’ irrespective of
Part II of the case note canvasses the facts of
decisions below. Part III sets out the High Court’s analysis of the
‘compensatory principle’, primarily
by reference to the judgment of
Edelman J. This part addresses two competing causal tests: the ‘but
for’ test and the
‘material contribution’ test. Part IV
examines the Court’s application of the ‘but for’ test and the
Court’s conclusion that the correct counterfactual is one in which Mr
Lewis was imprisoned lawfully. Part IV draws parallels
between the Court’s
reasoning in
v CCL Secure Pty Ltd
and argues that the two recent cases, taken together, are an unambiguous
indication from the High Court that Australian courts should
counterfactual ‘but for’ reasoning when calculating loss, subject to
certain exceptional circumstances where the
‘but for’ test
malfunctions. Part V analyses and supports the High Court’s wholesale
conceptual rejection of Mr
Lewis’ claim for ‘vindicatory
damages’ and ‘substantial damages to vindicate a right’. Part
VI concludes
the case note.

III HOW DOES THE COMPENSATORY PRINCIPLE
, Edelman J engaged in a detailed review of general
compensatory principles.
Honour commenced with the classic statement from
compensation should, as far as money can, put the party in ‘the same
position as he or she would have been in if the contract
had been performed or
the tort had not been
committed’.
noted that this ‘does not explain the manner in which money is awarded to
put the victim in the position they would
have been in if the wrong had not
Gordon J stated that the boundaries of the principle ‘cannot be stated in
abstract terms’
Gageler J noted that the principle is more easily stated than
The gulf between
principle and practice is evidently wide.
Edelman J drew a distinction between two forms of compensation and warned
against conflating the two: remedies which rectify
the wrongful act
itself, and remedies which compensate for ‘adverse consequences suffered
as a result of the wrong’.
Gordon J likewise noted the different purposes of different remedies:
‘[s]ome remedies seek to redress the infringement of
by vindication of that “right”, some seek to rectify or correct the
act that gave rise to the liability,
while other remedies seek to address the
loss or injury suffered’.
Her Honour emphasised the tailored nature of
A Rectifying the Wrongful Act Itself
Edelman J sets out a number of examples of compensation which is directed to
rectifying a wrongful act including: specific performance,
restraints on future
infringements, delivery up, substitutive compensation (or a
‘substitutionary remedy’), and damages
based on the ‘user
principle’.
devoted significant attention to ‘user principle’ damages, which
seek ‘to rectify the wrongful act by
requiring payment of an amount that
would have made the use

calculated by a hypothetical negotiation between a willing licensor and a

example, reasonable royalties may be payable for unauthorised use of
intellectual property rights.
This form of damages is not always available; if it is unlikely that a wrongful
act is a type of act for which permission could be
lawfully negotiated (eg, an
assault), then it is unlikely that ‘user principle’ damages will be

‘user principle’ damages operate ‘not merely to compensate the
plaintiff but to deny the defendant

imprisonment.
B Compensating the Consequences of the

‘rectifying the consequences of the wrong rather than
rectifying the
wrongful act itself’.
requires a close analysis of causation, which ‘establishes a link between
a physical event and a physical
Any attempt to
establish this link necessarily raises the question; what is the applicable
causal test?
1 ‘But For’ Causation
Edelman J framed the relevant causal inquiry as
whether the defendant’s wrongful act was necessary for the loss:
‘did the defendant’s act make a difference’
to that outcome?
That question is posed as a counterfactual: would the loss have lawfully
occurred without the defendant’s
wrongful act? In other words, would the
plaintiff have suffered the same loss but without a violation of their
His Honour held that an act which does not make a difference to the outcome
is ‘not a cause of the
articulation of ‘but for’ causation.
2 Material Contribution – Exceptional
Edelman J held that, while it is more difficult to
attribution of
responsibility to a defendant where the ‘but for’ test is not
satisfied, there are ‘exceptional
cases’ where a defendant may be
held liable ‘if their actions
materially contributed
which would have occurred in any
Causation of loss
in the ‘strict sense’ may not be
where, for example:
• several factories pollute a river, but no one factory was necessary
for the nuisance in isolation;
• a fraudulent misrepresentation is a factor that induces a plaintiff
to make an adverse decision, but the plaintiff would have
made the same decision
in any event.
The limitations of the ‘but for’ test to which Edelman J alludes
have been considered extensively in academic
literature.
In particular, the
‘but for’ test is often said to be inadequate in cases of
‘overdetermination’
‘underdetermination’.
A classic example of ‘overdetermination’, raised in
is where a ‘property is jointly destroyed by multiple fires all of which
were sufficient to destroy the property but the defendant
wrongdoer only caused
one of the fires’.
example is where ‘two hunters carelessly shoot and a mountain walker is
hit by both bullets each of which would have
been sufficient to kill
instantly’.
hunter liable? That seems an absurd consequence of the ‘but for’
A classic example of ‘underdetermination’ is that of 10 small
fires, none of which were independently sufficient to burn
a barn down, but
which combined to do so. As Bant and Paterson explained, ‘none of the
fires taken singly counts as a relevant
“cause” on the “but
for” test, seemingly denying the obvious positive contribution made by
each to the outcome’.
Professor Stapleton has highlighted that the ‘but for’ test is
under-inclusive in circumstances where:
• the defendant’s contribution to the outcome is neither
necessary nor sufficient (eg, three persons jointly push a car
off a mountain
where the force of any two of them was
• the extent of the defendant’s contribution to the outcome is
difficult to quantify (eg, the defendant is one of a number
of professional
advisers who influenced the plaintiff’s
Professor Stapleton has suggested that ‘courts grasp at vague undefined
labels such as “substantial factor” and
contribution”’ in an attempt to resolve this
under-inclusiveness.

perennial disagreement over the ‘notoriously
elastic’ material
contribution test.
IV DOES THE ‘BUT FOR’ TEST APPLY, AND IF
SO, WHAT IS THE CORRECT COUNTERFACTUAL INQUIRY?
A Mr Lewis’ Submission
Mr Lewis argued that he was entitled to compensation for ‘genuine
loss’ suffered during 82 days of false
imprisonment,
specifically
‘non-pecuniary damage including loss of liberty and injury to dignity and
He argued this
on the two alternative bases that:
• a counterfactual inquiry and the ‘but for’ test were not
applicable, and instead the correct test was whether
the relevant acts were
‘sufficient in combination with other conditions to produce the
• if the ‘but for’ test did apply, the correct
counterfactual was that Mr Lewis simply was not imprisoned at
Both arguments were
B Consideration by the High Court
1 Is the ‘But For’ Test
Applicable?
The High Court held that the ‘but for’ test was applicable in the
circumstances. Edelman J usefully articulated the operation
of the ‘but
for’ test as follows:
[T]he test for causation of loss asks whether the wrongful act was necessary
for the loss. The ‘but for’ or counterfactual
‘directs us to change one thing at a time and see if the outcome
changes’. The change is the removal of the
wrongful act. If the loss would
lawfully have occurred but for the wrongful act then the wrongful act was not
necessary for the loss.
The counterfactual approach thus involves a hypothetical
question where no other fact or circumstance is changed other than those
constituted the wrongful
Edelman J acknowledged the limitations of the ‘but for’ test
(discussed above), but elected not to throw out the baby
with the bathwater. His
Honour concluded that ‘the existence of these exceptional circumstances
cannot justify abolishing the
causal requirement that the wrongdoing must be
necessary for the loss’.
‘If a loss would have lawfully occurred even without the wrongful
act’, his Honour held, ‘then exceptional justification
is required
before responsibility can be imposed on a defendant who
contributed
to the manner in which the damage
Mr Lewis did
not identify an exceptional
justification.
Gordon J held that Mr Lewis was not entitled to compensatory damages because
his was a rare case where the counterfactual showed that
imprisonment was
inevitable.
Gordon J drew a
distinction between the role of counterfactuals in establishing
as distinct from
Her Honour held that
‘[o]n the question of liability for the tort of false imprisonment, there
is no role for a counterfactual
analysis that would seek to replace what did in
fact happen with what would otherwise have
By contrast,
‘when assessing compensatory damages, some counterfactual analysis is
necessary’ in order to apply the fundamental
compensatory
To ignore the
counterfactual at that stage would be ‘blind to the realities of the
situation’.
similarly observed that, when attributing tortious liability, the relevant
inquiry is ‘how things came about’
rather than ‘what made a
difference’,
counterfactual analysis enters at the subsequent stage of assessing entitlement
to compensatory damages.
J set out two examples of loss and demonstrated the necessity of counterfactual
reasoning in computing the quantum of damages:
A person unlawfully imprisoned may lose wages through an inability to work
while detained, or they may simply lose time. Each of these
is a compensable
loss – the former by an award of special damages and the latter by way of
general damages. It is difficult
to reach that conclusion without a
counterfactual. Why is the money a person would have earned in the time they
were unlawfully detained
something which is compensable? Precisely because they
earned that money if they had not been unlawfully imprisoned.
On the other hand, if the person would inevitably have been lawfully
for the relevant period of time, what is their loss or
Gordon J diverged semantically from Edelman J, opining that the application
of the term ‘causation’ to the process of
assessing loss is
‘unhelpful’.
Honour preferred to conceptualise ‘causation’ more narrowly as the
allocation of legal
responsibility.
Kiefel CJ and Keane J agreed that compensatory damages were not available to
Mr Lewis ‘because a counterfactual analysis in
relation to the issue of
causation reveals that the false imprisonment caused the appellant no loss that
he would not have suffered
had he not been falsely
imprisoned’.

What is the Correct Framing of the Counterfactual?
Mr Lewis proposed a counterfactual in which he simply was not
imprisoned.

rejected that submission and held that the correct counterfactual was one in
which Mr Lewis was imprisoned
Edelman J held that Mr Lewis’ proposed counterfactual was fundamentally
flawed as it ‘assume[d] the answer to the very
question being

policy, in his Honour’s view, the counterfactual was not in doubt on the

A Mr Lewis’ Submission
Mr Lewis sought substantial ‘vindicatory’ damages ‘simply
because his right to liberty was infringed and independently
of any consequences
of that infringement’.
He submitted, as a matter of principle, that ‘compensation for torts that
[are] actionable per se always requires substantial
damages even where no actual
loss is suffered’.
Lewis framed this in two different ways: as ‘substantial damages to
vindicate a right’ and ‘vindicatory damages’,

held were ultimately the same
