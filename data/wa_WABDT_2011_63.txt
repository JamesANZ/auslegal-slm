Introduction
2 March 2011, a complaint form was lodged at the Tribunal by Peter and Helen
the Complainants
”). The complaint is against GRH
Designs Pty Ltd (“
the Respondent
”), the Owner Builders of an
extension to a property at 6 Ford Street, Woodbridge.
complaint form followed a preliminary notice sent to Mr Grant Henderson of GRH
Designs Pty Ltd dated 15 February 2011. In that
notice, the
Complainants:
“Call on Mr Grant Henderson to rectify, or attempt to settle the
matters in relation to building work at 6 Ford Street,
Woodbridge.”
building work the subject of the complaint consisted of renovations undertaken
to the existing house at that address, and in particular,
the meals, kitchen,
activity and shed. In the preliminary notice, the Complainants
“We contend that GRH Designs (Grant Henderson) and Paterson, Tudor,
Owen & Parker, Consulting Surveyors, did not exercise
due diligence and
demonstrated poor workmanship in the development of the plans submitted for
building approval and the subsequent
construction.”
has occurred is that the rooms referred to above, being part of the renovation
work, have not been built inside the boundary
extension has encroached on property adjoining that owned by Mr and Mrs Bourne
being 8 Ford Street, Woodbridge.
The Hearing
hearing was held on 24 June 2011 to determine the issue of jurisdiction and to
give directions. At that hearing, Mr Bourne gave
evidence on behalf of himself
and his wife, and Grant Henderson gave evidence as a director of
Respondent. Mrs Henderson was present. Ms Jessop the owner of the adjoining
property onto which the building work encroached also
spoke at the hearing. Her
interest in the matter was noted and although she did not give evidence, the
Tribunal considered it appropriate
to listen to her.
is appropriate to set out the information provided to the hearing in relation to
the nature of the dispute and its relevance to
determination as to jurisdiction.
In a nutshell, the building work by way of an addition was undertaken by the
Respondent as Owner
Builder to 6 Ford Street, Woodbridge. That building work
encroached onto property owned by Ms Jessop at 8 Ford Street.
the extension work was completed the Respondent sold the property to the
Complainants. At the time of the sale the issue of
the encroaching building
work was discussed and it was agreed between the parties that the matter would
be resolved by the Complainants,
the Respondents and Ms Jessop preparing a deed
of easement for a right of carriageway in respect of the strip of land upon
the building work encroached.
was to be completed as part of the agreement to sell, however, neither party
provided evidence to suggest that it was a condition
of the sale. However, for
the purposes of this jurisdiction that matter is not overly
what is relevant is that following the settlement it came to the
Complainants’ attention and/or they formed the view
that the method agreed
by them to resolve the encroachment, being the provision of an easement, was not
an appropriate solution to
the issue of ownership of the land. The Respondent
is, and was at all times, ready and willing to do what is necessary to create
easement, however the Respondent does not wish to so proceed.
this hearing before the Tribunal.
the complaint form, under the heading “
what redress are you seeking?
the Complainants state, following an analysis of the options that they think
are viable in order to resolve the encroachment issue
“We and Ms Jessop believe that pursuing option 3 is the most
desirable and that this is done at no disadvantage or cost to
ourselves.”
“That there is agreement between Ms Jessop and ourselves that the
two lots are re-surveyed and that boundaries are adjusted
to their current
positions.”
in the claim form, the Complainants state:
“Given that we believe that had accurate plans been submitted to the
City of Swan this situation would not have arisen and that
it is reasonable to
believe had due diligence been executed by GRH Design (Mr Henderson). We believe
that Mr Henderson has the responsibility
to resolve this matter in the manner
described.”
questioned at the hearing as to exactly what orders the Complainants were
seeking from the Tribunal, it became quite apparent
that what the Complainants
were seeking was clearly an alternative resolution to the boundary dispute, in
lieu of the Easement.
order for the Complainants to be able to achieve an order of this Tribunal they
must have a complaint that falls within this Tribunal’s
Registration Act 1939
12A . Order to remedy unsatisfactory building work
(1) Where on complaint being made to it by any person,
including the Board, the Disputes Tribunal is satisfied that any building work
has not been carried out in a proper and workmanlike manner by reason that the
building work is faulty or unsatisfactory the Disputes
Tribunal may by order in
writing served on the person who carried out the building
order him to —
(a) remedy the faulty or unsatisfactory building work within such reasonable
time as is specified in the order; or
(b) pay to the owner of the building such costs of remedying the building work
that is faulty or unsatisfactory as the Disputes Tribunal
considers reasonable
in which case any costs so ordered by the Disputes Tribunal constitute a debt to
the owner and are recoverable
by him in a court of competent
complainants would have standing before the Tribunal under
, if they had
brought a claim based on an allegation that building work had not been carried
out in a proper and workmanlike manner
“By reason that the building work is faulty or
unsatisfactory.”
there is no claim, nor evidence before the Tribunal, that the building work,
being the meals, kitchen, activity and shed, which
were built by the Respondent
on the adjoining property is faulty or unsatisfactory. The Complainants’
complaint is about the
positioning
of the building work.
relation to that positioning, in certain circumstances in this Tribunal, the
Tribunal can entertain a complaint form in relation
to an order under
which reads as follows:
(1a) Where, on complaint being made to it by a person for whom building work
has been carried out, the Disputes Tribunal is satisfied
that in some respect
(other than its being faulty or unsatisfactory) the building work has not been
carried out in a proper and workmanlike
manner the Disputes Tribunal may, having
regard to the extent of the failure to carry out the building work in a
workmanlike manner in relation to the whole of the building
work, by order in writing served on the person who carried out the
building work
order him to —
(a) remedy the building work that has not been carried out in a proper and
workmanlike manner within such reasonable time as is specified
in the order;
(b) pay to the person for whom the building work was
(i) such costs of remedying the building work that has not been carried out in a
proper and workmanlike manner as the Disputes Tribunal
considers is reasonable;
(ii) such sum of money as the Disputes Tribunal considers reasonable to
compensate him for the failure to carry out the building
work in a proper and
workmanlike manner,
in order to be able to seek an order under
it is essential that the
Complainants (that is in this case Mr and Mrs Bourne) show that the building
work had been carried out pursuant
to a contract between them and the
Respondents. Clearly this is not the case.
it is not within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal under
the Tribunal to entertain the Complainants complaint.
the matter will have to be dismissed for want of
