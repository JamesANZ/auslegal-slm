Review: David Mossop,
Constitution
of the Australian
Capital Territory
(Federation Press, 2021)
The Australian Capital Territory is a quirk of federation, an artefact from
the era of whalebone corsets and telegram boys in which
the parochial squabble
between New South Wales and Victoria about which jurisdiction would host the
national capital was resolved
with the answer ‘neither’. It is a
for bureaucrats who did not quite cut it in the Australian Public
Service, a domain of quinoa puddings and feel-good government policies
occasion are a matter of woke self-congratulation. Critics can be unkind.
Constitution
of the Australian Capital Territory
(Federation Press, 2021) by
Justice David Mossop of the ACT Supreme Court offers a different and welcome
perspective that is of value
for scholars, practitioners and policy-makers
within and outside the Territory.
The 258 page book complements authoritative studies of other jurisdictions, for
example Twomey’s
Constitution
of New South Wales
Constitution
In explaining the constitutional arrangements for the government of the
Australian Capital Territory Mossop offers an outline of the
Commonwealth
enactments that make up the constitution of the Territory, most notably the
Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988
(Cth). The work
covers the establishment of the Territory and the history of its government
since 1911, addressing the granting of
self-government in 1989 (a grant not
unanimously applauded by ACT residents accustomed to Commonwealth support), the
Commonwealth’s
constitutional power to make laws for the government of the
Territory and the extent to which the power in s 122 of the
Constitution
qualified by other provisions of the
Constitution
, the constitutional framework
for the Legislative Assembly and the power of the Assembly to make laws and the
scope of executive
and judicial power in the Territory, and the division of
responsibilities for land management in the Territory between the Commonwealth
and Territory governments.
The book is structured as nine chapters dealing with the constitutional
development of the Territory, the Commonwealth’s Territories
Self-government, the Legislative Assembly, Legislative Power, Finance, Executive
Power, Land management and Judicial Power.
The emphasis is on statute and case
law; there is sparse reference to non-legal literature.
The first chapter considers the history of s 125 of the national
Constitution
, the determination of the location of the seat of government, the
acceptance of the Territory and its naming, questions of land tenure
(misread by
some Canberrans as a perpetual lease), administration of the Territory from 1911
to 1989, and arguments regarding statehood.
The latter resurface periodically in
the ACT and Northern Territory, most recently in the 2021
Ensuring Northern
Territory Rights Bill 2021
that sought to ‘reduce the level of
Commonwealth interference with laws of the Northern Territory related to
acquisition of
property on just terms, voluntary assisted dying and powers in
relation to the hearing and determining of employment disputes’.
submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee
considering that Bill, George Williams noted
that the Australian constitution
'reserves rights and privileges to the states and Australians who live there,
while permitting these
to be denied to Territorians':
This entrenched discrimination is made all the worse by the special powers of
the Commonwealth to intervene in territory affairs.
Self-government in the ACT
and the Northern Territory depends upon the favour of the Commonwealth. It can
at any time remove their
right to be governed by a local assembly and can return
either to direct federal rule.
Chapter Two of the book offers a more detailed discussion of that Territories
Power, identifying over a century of territories cases
before considering s 122
Constitution
(a plenary power) and the status of the Australian Capital
Territory as part of “the Commonwealth” for the purposes of
Mossop discusses when are laws made under s 122, the relationship between s 122
and other provisions of the
Constitution
, and implied restrictions on the s 122
power. The third chapter covers the move to self-government for the Territory,
identifying
the self-government legislation, changes to the structure of
self-government since 1989, the Territory as a “body politic under
Crown”, the Crown’s role, the transfer of laws at self-government
and the relationship to the Jervis Bay Territory.
Chapter Four considers the ACT Legislative Assembly., discussing that
legislature’s basic structure, elections and dissolution,
the formation of
a government, deliberative procedure, the process for making laws, privileges
and immunities. Chapter Five addresses
Legislative Power, with a discussion of
“peace, order and good government”, limitations on power from the
Constitution
, express exclusions from legislative power in the Self-Government
Act, inconsistency between Commonwealth and Territory laws, the
extent to which
the Commonwealth is bound by Territory laws, laws mandated by the
self-government legislation, powers retained in
Seat of Government
(Administration) Act 1910
(Cth), the relationship between Territory and
State laws, and ‘Manner and Form’ requirements.
Through a neoliberal lens government is a matter of getting and spending
money. Mossop’s sixth chapter deals with Finance, encompassing
moneys of the Territory, the withdrawal of public moneys and appropriations,
financial relations with the Commonwealth,
borrowing and unauthorised payments.
Chapter Seven concerns the Territory Executive. The chapter analyses statute and
case law regarding
what is the Executive, its composition, the Cabinet, the
Executive’s powers and responsibility, the Crown in right of the
and the relationship with executive power of the Commonwealth under s
Constitution
The penultimate chapter looks at law regarding land management, with a
valuable introduction to the Planning & Land Management
Act, the National
Capital Plan and Territory Plan, before questions about the Canberra Airport and
Googong Dam. The final chapter
concerns the Judicial Power. It offers an
introduction to the history of judicial power in the ACT, the constitutional
position of
Territory courts, s 48A of the Self-Government Act, the tenure and
removal of judges, and the separation of powers.
Constitution
of the Australian Capital Territory
reference book that is likely to feature on the shelves of all ACT law forms and
might usefully be embraced by political candidates
and their advisors,
particularly those whose enthusiasm for reform (or for a media opportunity)
outleaps their understanding of what
is constitutionally possible. A major
critique of the ACT as one of the three ‘human rights’ jurisdictions
on integrity mechanisms such as the Territory’s freedom of
information regime remains to be written.
