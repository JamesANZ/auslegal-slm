COUNSEL: N/A
SOLICITOR/S: N/A
September 2006 Birla Mount Gordon Pty Ltd (hereafter referred to as “the
Applicant”) lodged Mining Lease Application
No 90180 with the Mining
Registrar, Mt Isa District. The Application was lodged pursuant to
Mineral Resources Act 1989
(“the Act”) for the purpose of
mining for silver ore, gold, cadmium ore, cobalt ore, copper ore, molybdenum
ore, zinc ore, stock pile ore/overburden and tailings/settling dam.
No objections were duly lodged to the Mining Lease
Application.
Request to dispense with a
hearing – Section 270
The Applicant has requested
that the Application be dealt with without an oral hearing. Taking in to
account s. 270 of the Act, I
am satisfied that there is sufficient information
before me. Accordingly, I order that a hearing of this Application be dispensed
Section 269(4)
In taking account of and
considering the criteria specified in
of the Act, I have relied on the
Applicant’s Additional
Information and Statutory Declaration. I have also
relied upon the
other material lodged by the Applicant with the Mining Registrar
and the Mining Registrar’s Report in relation to this Application.
reasons refer to the salient points, but not all
the relevant evidence, that I
have taken into account.
Section 269(4)(a)
– Have the provisions of the Act been complied with
On 27 March 2007, the Mining
Registrar issued a Certificate of Application. The Mining Registrar can only
issue the Certificate if
satisfied that the Applicant is eligible to apply for
the mining lease and has complied with the requirements of the Act with respect
to the Application.
I note that
the Application is over a non-exclusive
In my opinion, there is
sufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of the Act in respect to
this Application.
Section 269(4)(b)
– Is the land applied for mineralised or are the
other purposes for which the lease is sought appropriate?
I am satisfied
from the Applicant’s evidence that the purposes for which the lease is
sought are appropriate. I note that the
lease area is primarily required for
infrastructure.
Section 269(4)(c)
– If the land applied for is mineralised, will there
be an acceptable level of development and utilisation
of the mineral resources
within the area applied for?
The material
before me reveals the Applicant’s proposed mining operations and program,
and shows appropriate development and
utilisation of the area applied
Section 269(4)(d)
– Is the land and the surface area of that land in
respect of which the mining lease is sought of an appropriate
size and shape?
The material
before me appears to indicate a mining lease application of an appropriate size
and shape in light of the proposed mining
Section 269(4)(e)
– Is the term sought appropriate?
The term sought
for this mining lease is 15 years, which I consider appropriate.
Section 269(4)(f)
– Has the Applicant the necessary financial and
technical capabilities to carry on mining operations under
the proposed mining
The material
indicates that the Applicant has the financial and technical capabilities to
carry on the mining operations. The Applicant
has previous mining experience.
I am satisfied that the requirements of this criterion are met.
Section 269(4)(g)
– Has the past performance of the Applicant been
satisfactory?
Applicant’s evidence is that it has received two show cause notices, both
in 2006. The applicant has explained the circumstances
of those show cause
notices, and no follow-up enforcement action was taken against it.
Section 269(4)(h)
– Will any disadvantage result to the holders of
existing exploration permits or mineral development licences
or existing
for exploration permits or mineral development licences?
The material
as originally lodged conflicted on this issue. The Mining Registrar reported
that the application area was subject to
3 exploration permit applications
(“EPM’s”), while the applicant said there were no competing
interests. The Mining
Registrar clarified the position by advice dated 22
August 2007. She advised that the mining lease application subject to the 3
EPM’s falls within land in moratorium pursuant to
of the Act, and as
such the 3 EPM’s were lodged on 2 October
2006. I am grateful to the
Mining Registrar for providing this
clarification.
Section 269(4)(i)
– Do the operations to be carried on under the
authority of the mining lease conform with sound land use management?
There is no
evidence before me to suggest that the proposed operations do not conform with
sound land use management.
Section 269(4)(j)
– Will there be any adverse environmental impacts,
and if so, the extent thereof:
environmental authority was publicly advertised and received no objection.
There is no evidence to suggest that the environmental
impacts will not be
adequately dealt with by compliance with the conditions of the authority.
Section 269(4)(k)
– Will the public right and interest be prejudiced?
The material
before me does not reveal any area of concern for the public right and interest.
Section 269(4)(l)
– Has any good reason been shown for a refusal to
grant the mining lease?
There was no
evidence before me that indicated any good reason why this Application should be
Section 269(4)(m)
– Is the proposed mining operation an appropriate
land use taking into consideration the current and prospective
uses of the
The materials
show that the project is for the extraction of a potentially valuable resource
in accordance with the environmental
processes. I am satisfied that the
proposed mining operation is an appropriate land use.
Recommendation
Taking into
account all the evidence before me and, in particular, that evidence referred to
and subject to native title processes, I recommend to the
Honourable the Minister for Mines and Energy that Mining Lease No. 90180
granted over the entire application area for the purpose and term sought by the
of the Act.
I also note that this
application is subject to Right to Negotiate processes under the
Native Title
