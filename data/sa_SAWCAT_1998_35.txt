In the matter of an appeal by
ANASTASIA ZIGORONIKAS
the worker, against
the determination of a
REVIEW OFFICER
dated the 24th day of March, 1997,
which also concerns
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES,

(No. 45W of 1997)
Her Honour Deputy President Judge H.W. Parsons
REASONS FOR DECISION
PUBLISHED THE 4TH DAY OF DECEMBER,
Appeal - Assessment of non-economic loss - Pain or apprehended pain basis of
partial loss of capacity to engage in sexual intercourse
- Appeal allowed -
, Regulation 16A
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, 1986
Cases cited:
Worker's Rehabilitation and Compensation Corporation v. Battaglia
177 L.S.J.S. 386.
Appearances:
Ms. M. Shaw Q.C., with Mr G. Symeonakis (of counsel) for the Appellant.
Ms. L. Chapman and Mr. J. Telfer (of counsel) for the Respondent.
By decision delivered on 13 February 1998 (A.5/1998) the Tribunal allowed the
appeal of the worker, Anastasia Zigoronikas, against
the decision of a Review
Officer whereby her entitlement for an assessment of permanent loss of capacity
to engage in sexual intercourse
was fixed at 5%.
After an unsuccessful attempt by the parties to agree the quantum of the
worker's entitlement the parties have now jointly requested
that the Tribunal
replace the Review Officer's assessment with its own relying on the evidence
given at Review.
Following is a summary of matters relevant to that assessment. The worker
suffered two separate compensable disabilities on 15
February 1993 and 27
July 1994 respectively (incorrectly described in the decision (A.5/1998) as `15
February and 27 September 1993').
As a consequence she suffered injury to
various body parts and has been compensated pursuant to
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986
') as follows:-
25% loss of function of the left arm above the elbow
10% loss of total bodily function in respect of the left eye, nostril and
facial disfigurement
5% loss of function of the neck
7% loss of function of the right arm
Pain or apprehended pain at these various sites forms the basis of the worker's
claim of a partial loss of capacity to engage in
sexual intercourse. The worker
is now in her late 40's. The evidence which she gave at review as to her
difficulties with sexual
intercourse, naturally enough, centred on her sexual
relationship with her husband. Her immediate pre-injury sexual history was of
sexual intercourse on average twice per week in a variety of positions; the
only limiting feature being that because of a tilted
womb the female dominant
position was painful and therefore less frequently adopted.
The effects which the injuries have on her ability to engage in sexual
intercourse were summarised in A5/1998 as follows:-
`Following the injury of 15 February 1993, in which she fractured her left
wrist and arm and suffered a depressed fracture of the
left cheekbone, the
worker suffered pain or apprehended pain in the face, left wrist and arm. This
pain or apprehended pain resulted
in the frequency of intercourse being reduced
to about once a month usually in the missionary position. In addition to pain
or apprehended
pain making the act of sexual intercourse painful, on occasions
her husband could not penetrate her vagina because she "shut down".
intercourse had to be abandoned because the worker became upset and tearful
also affected her ability to
engage in female to male oral sex or to engage in kissing either as part of
foreplay or during intercourse.
This situation was exacerbated by the 1994 injury in which she injured her
right arm, shoulder and her neck. Because of these additional
injuries which
resulted in pain or apprehended pain to the right arm, neck and shoulder, the
frequency of intercourse was further
reduced to about once every three months
and she was only able to engage in intercourse in the missionary position if
she lies "like
a lump" not actively participating in the act.
In addition to the evidence which she gave about her level of pain or
apprehended pain, the worker also said that she only has
intercourse "to keep
the peace". She described feeling emotional at the prospect; "I am forced to do
something when I'm in pain and
because of the pain I feel that I should have
that choice to refuse because I don't really want to experience pain every time
happens". She described a tension between herself and her husband about
The respondent did not dispute the worker's evidence of pain or fear of pain
in the left wrist and arm, face, right arm, shoulder
and neck causing her to
desist from intercourse. For the reasons already explained in A.5/1998 the
evidence which the worker gave
of `shut down' when she said that her husband
could not penetrate her, stands uncontested.
The principles to be applied in the assessment of the disability were outlined
by the former Chief Justice in
Worker's Rehabilitation and Compensation
Corporation v. Battaglia
(1994) 177 L.S.J.S. 386.
`The compensation is for
the loss of the power or ability to perform the act.' not for `pain and
discomfort or for reduced pleasure
or for diminished desire or frequency
arising from causes other than incapacity.' In the instant matter what the
worker described
was different in character from diminished enjoyment or lack
of fulfilment. She described pain or apprehended pain which caused her
desist from sexual intercourse, on occasions to abandon the act, on occasions
to experience vaginismus preventing penetration
and the abandonment of
positions customarily adopted. I exclude from that the female dominant position
avoidance of which was influenced
by non- injury related considerations.
I also take into account that the worker's complaints in relation to pain and
sensitivity of her face were, in part, associated
with the preliminaries to
sexual intercourse such as kissing and cuddling, and to that extent a seemingly
artificial distinction
needs to be drawn between activities which cause pain
but which precede intercourse, and similar activities which take place
simultaneously
with intercourse and which lead to apprehended pain sufficient
to cause the worker to desist from intercourse; the former being outside
scope of an assessment and the latter being intrinsic to it.
I also note that a disability of this kind is not easily amenable to objective
assessment and that an individual's sexual activity
can be influenced by a
range of other factors. For that reason care should be taken to ensure that any
assessment reflects the effect
which the disabilities only, have on the
worker's capacity to engage in sexual intercourse, rather than other
psycho-sexual influences.
The worker spoke frankly about her disappointment in
her husband's lack of understanding of her position. Her perception was that
lacked sensitivity or appreciation of the extent to which pain or apprehended
pain prevented her from engaging in sexual intercourse.
This was described by
Dr. Lashchuk as resentment for the lack of understanding and support given to
her by her husband. In assessing
this entitlement due consideration must be
given to the probability that this resentment is one of the complex of factors
into the worker's sexual experience.
Various of the examining doctors have made assessments; Dr. Cohen
assessed her entitlement at 20%, Dr. Giurgius made an assessment
of 10%. Dr.
Ormandy mentioned her history of reduced sexual capacity but did not make an
assessment. Although Dr. Lashchuk expressed
the view that there was relatively
little physical loss of capacity to engage in sexual intercourse his view does
not accord with
the legal test in
and to that extent it is to
be discounted.
I note these various assessments however having applied the legal test to the
worker's evidence as to reduced frequency and variety
of positions and the
explanation for it, and having excluded from consideration the unrelated
matters specifically referred to earlier
in these reasons, I conclude that she
has a permanent partial loss of the capacity to engage in sexual intercourse
resulting from
the combined effect of the 1993 and 1994 disabilities, to the
extent of 25%. That assessment represents the extent to which pain
apprehended pain resulting from the physical and psychological consequences of
these disabilities causes her to desist from, or
abandon, sexual intercourse.
As this assessment represents the combined effect of both disabilities the
prescribed sum for 1994 should be applied. In addition,
Schedule 3 Clause 5
requires that Regulation 16A be applied to the assessment.
I uphold the worker's appeal and substitute my assessment for that of the
Review Officer. I give the parties liberty to apply as
to the calculation of
the monetary entitlement.
In accordance with the requirements of section 93 of the
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, 1986
the parties are notified that if a
party wishes to apply to the Full Supreme Court for leave to appeal against any
part of this decision
which raises a question of law, such appeal must be
instituted within one month after a party who is entitled to appeal receives
notice of this decision.
NOTE CAREFULLY:
Parties are respectfully requested to note the provisions of the Supreme Court
Rules 96.04(a) and 97.05 which require that in the
event of an appeal a copy of
the Notice of Appeal filed in the Supreme Court is to be served upon `the
proper officer of the Court
or Tribunal below'.
