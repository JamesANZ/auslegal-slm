REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
14 August 2009 the Tribunal made interim orders in this proceeding, including
that the hearing of the application be adjourned
and that it be, in time, listed
for a further Directions Hearing.
order made on 21 September 2009 the Tribunal ordered that the authors of the two
expert reports confer with a view to clarifying
and, if possible, agreeing on
the issues raised in the Tribunal’s preliminary decision on 14 August
2009. By a document faxed
to the Tribunal on 5 October 2009 the parties gave
the Tribunal a table showing the differences between the respective reports and
containing comments on behalf of the respondent, as well as a copy of the
original letter sent to Resident Building Services dated
20 January 2006.
accordance with a further order made on 21 September 2009, the Tribunal has now
determined, pursuant to
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal
”), that all of the proceeding be
decided from a consideration of the documents filed.
Reasons for Decision given by the Tribunal for the orders made on 14 August 2009
raised certain questions which the Tribunal indicated
would benefit from more
extensive evidence or more extensive legal argument.
can be seen from the documentary material given to the Tribunal on 5 October
2009 (although, since the documents were received
by fax after 4.00 pm on 5
October 2009, the registry has stamped the documents accompanying the header
sheet as filed on 6 October
2009) that the questions raised by the Tribunal have
been largely ignored. In particular, there is nothing in that material which
any way addresses the question of the true meaning of By-Law 27.2. Furthermore,
there is nothing in that material which addresses
the criticisms raised about
the L & S Report by the body corporate concerning the identification of
alleged errors in that Report.
the Joint Report simply sets out what was contained in both original Reports and
purports to defend why the original allocations
Consideration
the approach of the authors of both the L & S Report and the SSKB Report,
the Tribunal has no choice but to make the following
determinations:
criticisms, now repeated in the covering notes made by the respondent dated 5
October 2009, have not been addressed by the
L & S Report, because they are
of sufficient importance to undermine the conclusions reached in that Report,
the consequence
is that the Tribunal must ignore the conclusions so reached and
therefore the allocations so made;
elaboration sought of the consequences of By-Law 27.2 has been ignored by both
authors of the two Reports, given that both
the applicant and the respondent
urge acceptance of the SSKB Report, the Tribunal will accept for present
purposes the conclusions
set out in the SSKB Report and the consequential
allocations made concerning the swimming pool, spa, tennis court and
despite the fact
that that column in the Experts’ “Table 1” which deals with
“SSKB Comment” contains
justifications which are totally incongruent
with the allocation made in the column entitled “SSKB Allocation
for Items 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 (in that the justification
contained in the “SSKB Comment” for the Allocation
Method used is
the justification for a conclusion of an allocation of “Equal” in
circumstances where the conclusion expressed
in the column is a conclusion
relevant to an allocation of “Area”, which has its own justification
where such an allocation
has been otherwise used), since the author of the SSKB
Report has not changed any of his conclusions, it can only be assumed that
error just identified is one made in ignorance or by oversight, and, in reality,
that the author adheres to the conclusions reached
in the “SSKB Allocation
Method” that accords with the “working paper” contained on
pages 5 and 6 of Appendix
3 in the SSKB Report of 18 May 2009 (as no indication
whatsoever is given to the contrary).
Accordingly,
the Tribunal is convinced that the mechanical exercise undertaken by the author
of the SSKB Report justifies a decision
that the lot entitlements in the
Contribution Schedule should be adjusted because, in accordance with
the existing lot
entitlements for the Contribution Schedule are not equal;
it is just and
equitable in the circumstances for those lot entitlements not to be equal;
but the extent
of inequality based upon justice and fairness means that the existing inequality
should be adjusted so that the inequality
should be that which is set out in the
column entitled “Lot entitlement” in the “Suggested
Schedule” contained
in Appendix 3 to the SSKB Report (and set out in
Section 15 of the SSKB Report).
20 March 2009 the Tribunal made orders that, save and except as addressed in the
Order made that day, the applications of the “applicants
inclusion” be dismissed and that the costs of and incidental to those
applications, include those of the hearing of the
application on 13 February
2009, be reserved.
by orders made by the Tribunal on 14 August 2009, the costs of and incidental to
the interlocutory hearing on the papers
were reserved.
the Reasons for Decision for the orders made 20 March 2009 the Tribunal observed
in paragraph [10] that it may well be that, ultimately,
the additional material
that comes before the Tribunal as a result of the effort of the
“applicants for inclusion” has
a significant effect on the outcome
and, for that particular reason, the Tribunal intended to reserve the costs of
and incidental
to the application for which the hearing was held on 13 February
that the applicant, the respondent and the proposed inclusion parties had legal
representation on 13 February 2009, given that
the solicitors for the
“applicants for inclusion” had presented written submissions on
costs to the Tribunal on 20 March
2009, and given that the additional material
from the authors of the L & S Report has had no effect on the outcome, not
an insignificant one, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to order that the
costs of and incidental to the two applications made by
the applicants for
inclusion, including the costs of and incidental to the hearing on 13 February
2009, be paid by the applicants
for inclusion who by the order of 13 February
2009 were permitted legal representation in the proceeding.
because of the short compass of both applications, the legal issues concerned,
and the way in which the orders were eventually
determined, the Tribunal will
fix the costs in the sum of $1,000.00. Also, given the circumstances
surrounding the orders made on
13 February 2009, the order should be that the
applicants for inclusion pay the applicant in the proceeding the costs of and
to the two applications brought by the proposed inclusion parties,
including those of the hearing of the application on 13 February
2009, to be
fixed in the sum of $1,000.00 and paid within fourteen (14) days of the order
made for such costs.
between the applicant and the respondent, given the way in which this proceeding
has been conducted, particularly with respect
to both those parties at all times
agreeing that the appropriate report was the SSKB Report and given that the
Tribunal has made
an adjustment to the lot entitlements in the Contribution
Schedule in accordance with that Report, there should be no order as to
between them.
because neither the applicant nor the respondent has been given the opportunity
to address the Tribunal on costs, an order will
be made giving leave that any
submissions on costs be filed within seven (7) days of the making of the
relevant orders here. Otherwise,
there will be no order as to costs as between
