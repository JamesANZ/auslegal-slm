critical condition and queried whether he may have been involved

The Offender's Subjective Circumstances
The offender had a criminal history including a number of appearances before
the Children’s Court for offences of taking and
driving a conveyance and
being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner [62]. The
offender’s criminal history
also included offences of violence, including
the assault of a police officer and affray [63].
On 7 June 2012, one month before the present offences, the offender had
appeared before the Parramatta Children’s Court on a
charge of assault
occasioning actual bodily harm and was ordered to undertake 18 months’
probation, attend counselling and
was subject to conditional liberty [64-65].
The offence occurred at a party in Blacktown on 28 January 2011, at which the

of ten years and two months.

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/ or indicators of disadvantage
The Court noted that the offender's parents had separated when he was at a
young age, the offender had said he had been subjected
to corporal punishment by
both parents and his high school education had been dislocated [77-78].
The Court considered the offender’s prior offences of violence, and
that he was subject to conditional liberty for an alcohol-fuelled
violence just one month prior to the present offences [120]. Their Honours
considered that the offender’s acts and
words indicated "
an expectation
on his part that there would be trouble
" [122]. The Court felt that there
was no basis for the finding of the sentencing Judge that it was very unlikely
that the offender
would reoffend [127] and that the offender's prospects of
rehabilitation were "
somewhat problematic
The intoxication of the offender "
did not assist him at all on
Relevant passage(s):
Regard should be had to the Respondent's
youth, his deprived upbringing and the fact that this is his first time in
custody. General
deterrence and specific deterrence are most significant factors
on sentence for reasons outlined earlier in this judgment. The Respondent's
of reoffending and prospects of rehabilitation remain somewhat problematic,
although there has been some progress in custody.
A finding cannot be made that
he is unlikely to reoffend
Grounds of appeal:
1 - his Honour erred by failing to take into account the additional need for
general deterrence due to the prevalence of alcohol-fuelled
offences of
2 - his Honour erred by failing to take into account the need for specific
deterrence of the offender;
3 - his Honour erred by double counting subjective features when making a
finding of special circumstances;
4 - his Honour erred in failing to take into account material considerations in
relation to intent and risk;
5 - his Honour erred in classifying each offence as spontaneous.
6 - his Honour failed to accumulate the sentences sufficiently; and
7 - the sentences, individually and in total, are manifestly inadequate
Appeal outcomes:
The Court held that the sentencing Judge had not emphasised the role of general
deterrence on sentence or given effect to
that principle [108-109].
The sentencing Judge had made flawed findings in relation to the offender's
risks of reoffending and his prospects of rehabilitation
and the sentencing
Judge had not made any real allowance for specific deterrence [129].
The Court accepted that the sentencing Judge did not acknowledge the need to
guard against impermissible double counting,
but was not persuaded that patent
error had been demonstrated [138-139]. However, the Court noted that appropriate
principles would
need to be taken into account if the offender was resentenced
The Court considered that the factual findings in the case called for an
assessment of the ongoing cumulative acts and words
of the offender [154], and
viewed these matters as magnifying the objective seriousness of the second,
third, fourth and fifth offences
The Court considered that the first offence committed against Mr Compagnoni
could be characterised as "
spontaneous
", but that term could not be
applied to the separate attacks that followed. The sentencing judge's
characterisation of the attacks
on the whole spontaneous
operated to reduce the true degree of their seriousness. [168-169]. The Court
noted this ground of appeal would need to be taken
into account if the offender
was resentenced [170].
The sentencing Judge applied the relevant principles in approaching the
accumulation of sentences in this case [177].
The Court considered the context and surrounding circumstances in which the
offence was committed [230]: the interrelationship
between the offences which
served to magnify their seriousness, the offender having committed the offences
whilst being subject to
conditional liberty and the offender's anger management
issues and intentions [201-207]. Relevant United Kingdom caselaw was considered,
[208-213] as was the need to consider each one-punch manslaughter case on its
particular facts [215] and the need for both specific
[218] and general
deterrence [219]. The Court noted that the sentencing Judge's use of sentencing
decisions was "
somewhat clouded
" as he had regard to them as if they
disclosed a range of sentences to be applied [224]. It was held that the assault
of Mr Compagnoni
was a serious example of a
offence [234] and the three
counts of assault were grave examples of
offences [237]. The Court held
that the sentences should have been substantially greater than those imposed
[241] and that the sentencing
judge had made patent and latent errors
