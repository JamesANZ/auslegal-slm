Representation
The applicant in all matters is
unrepresented
In each of these four applications, the applicant seeks leave to issue or file
an application for a constitutional or other
writ. The applicant requires leave
because Jagot J, acting under r 6.07.2 of the
High Court Rules
(Cth) directed the Registrar to refuse to issue or file the
applications without the leave of a Justice of this Court.
the factual background to each proposed application for a constitutional or
other writ and in the applicant's affidavits supporting
his applications for
leave, the applicant makes various allegations centred around charges in the
Devonport Magistrates Court and
raises issues including the nature of his
identity as "the living breathing man and ... not the dead fictional
entity/artificial
person/legal fiction/Ens Legis 'RALPH ALFRED YOUNG' or any
variation thereof, created by the STATE for the administration of a Trust".
is nothing in any of the materials contained in the applications for leave to
issue or file or in the accompanying affidavits
that discloses any arguable
basis for any of the relief sought. The proposed applications for constitutional
or other writs are,
on their face, manifestly untenable (and thus an abuse of
process) and also frivolous and vexatious within r 6.07.1 of the
Court Rules
. The applications for leave should be determined without being
listed for hearing and with reasons published in accordance with r
High Court Rules
. The applicant's ex parte applications for leave to
issue or file applications for a constitutional or other writ, each filed on
2 July 2025, are refused.
