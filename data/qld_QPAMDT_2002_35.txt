REASONS FOR DECISION:
This claim was heard and decided in the
absence of the respondent Jennifer Pham, whose whereabouts has been unknown as
long ago as
2000 when the Office of Fair Trading was unable to locate Ms Pham to
discuss the claim with her.
The applicant’s solicitor, Mr Rodney
Stockley filed an Affidavit on 16 July 2002 to which was attached as Exhibit
a report from Backtracker Investigations dated 13 June 2002 in
which the Agent, Mr O’Neil outlined that his inquiries indicated
Pham had not lived at 105 Darra Avenue Darra for some time, as the current
tenant had been resident at that address since
March 2002. Mr Stockley deposes
to his contact of Mr Paul Grandy, the landlord of the premises at 105 Darra
Avenue Darra. Mr Grandy
has owned the premises since mid 2001 and Jennifer Pham
has not been a tenant since then. Mr Grandy did have a recollection of being
handed some mail for a Chong Mi Choi, shortly after he took possession of the
property. The judgment of S.L.Cornack SM states that
this was a name by which
Jennifer Pham was known. The judgment also states that Jennifer Pham was known
as Choi Chong Mi.
An Affidavit by Jessica Gilmore, a Clerk
in Mr Stockley’s office, was also filed on 16 July 2002. Ms
Gilmore’s search

Stockley deposes that he wrote to that person at the address in question.

involvement in the real estate industry. Mr Stockley

letter, which he described
at the hearing as a “long

that she does not know the whereabouts of Jennifer Pham.
5 On the basis
of all of the material I am satisfied that Jennifer Pham can not be located
after the making of reasonable inquiries
into her whereabouts.
claimant has made a claim against the fund pursuant to Section 119 of the
Auctioneers and Agents Act 1971(now repealed) on the
basis of loss arising from
breach of Section 72 of the Auctioneers and Agents Act 1971 by one Jennifer
Pham. Section 604 of the
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 provides
for a claim against the former fund to be continued against the fund under the
7 I am satisfied on the basis of the
material, particularly the judgment of S.L.Cornack SM, that the claimant has
suffered a loss
and I allow the claim wholly in the sum of $7027.91.
am satisfied that the loss occurred as a result of misrepresentations made by
Jennifer Pham to the claimant, as Jennifer Pham
attempted to obscure from the
claimant and her husband (now deceased) the true identity of the purchaser of
the property at 83 Lovett
Street Ellengrove. The person who caused the
claimant’s loss is Jennifer
