[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 26 June, 2009, Vol. 191, No. 7, page 214]
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Relations Act 1999
s. 341(2) - appeal against decision of
industrial magistrate
David Francis Cox AND John Anthony Caton
(C/2009/16)
PRESIDENT HALL
17 June 2009
Section 406(1) of the
Industrial Relations Act 1999
(the Act) imposes
a statutory duty upon employers to pay superannuation contributions due under an
industrial instrument. Section
666 of the Act imposes a statutory obligation to
pay wages due under an industrial instrument. Neither subsection uses the noun
"offence". However, each of ss. 406(2) and 666(2) describe breach of the
obligation as an offence. Additionally, each of ss. 406(1)
and 666(1) fixes a
maximum penalty. In consequence, s. 41 of the
Acts Interpretation Act
operates to make breach of the duty an offence.
On 23 February
2009, Mr Caton was charged on one complaint and summons with two offences under
s. 666 of the Act for failing to pay
wages under an industrial instrument to a
Mr Stevens. On the same day he was further charged on a separate complaint and
with an offence under s. 406 of the Act for failing to make
contributions to an approved superannuation fund at a level required
industrial instrument.
Additionally, once again on 23 February 2009, Mr
Caton was charged on one complaint and summons with two offences under s. 666
failing to pay wages under an industrial instrument to a Ms Collier and a
further charge under s. 406 for failing to make contributions
to an approved
superannuation fund at a level required by the industrial instrument.
In relation to each (of the four) complaints, the notation "
", appeared in the top left hand corner. In the same corner the
section of the (expressly named)
Industrial Relations Act 1999
the relevant offence was nominated. Each complaint and summons was properly
served. Each of the complaints was listed
for hearing before the Industrial
Magistrate at Richlands on 6 April 2009. There was no appearance by Mr Caton.
Mr Caton was ordered
to pay all of the amounts specified in the complaints, in
default levy on distress, in default imprisonment. No time for payment
specified in the orders. The Industrial Magistrate declined to convict and fine
Mr Caton on any of the four complaints because
the complaints did not allege
that Mr Caton had committed an offence.
No authority was cited by the
Industrial Magistrate. The research of Counsel has failed to locate any
supporting authority. There
is authority to the contrary;

L.J.K.B. 689 AT 690 PER Lord
Reading CJ. Additionally, s. 47 of the
Justices Act 1886
requires an
offence to be described in the words of the Act creating the offence or in
similar words. Here, that had been done.
Further, the forms used were those

notified in the Queensland
Government Gazette (No 115, 16 August 1996).
accept the Appellant's submission that the proceedings at first instance have
miscarried. However, I doubt that the appropriate
remedy is to set aside the
decision of the Industrial Magistrate upon the allegations of breach and to
substitute another decision.
To begin with, although I understand what has
happened, I doubt that the Industrial Magistrate actually made orders about the
offences. Second, even in the case of s. 666 of the Act, if the
proceedings were incompetent, it may be doubted that power at s.
666(6)(b) to
deal with the underpayment was triggered. Third, if the fine is imposed by this
Court there may be an issue about whether
a warrant may issue in the event of
In all of the circumstances, I exercise the power at s.
248(1)(e) of the Act to quash the proceedings in all matters initiated by
complaints in the Industrial Magistrate's Court and to quash the orders made
therein by the Industrial Magistrate. I further
order that each of the matters
be remitted to the Industrial Magistrate's Court at Richlands to be heard and
determined according
