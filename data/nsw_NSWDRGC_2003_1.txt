1. This applicant has been referred to the Drug Court
on a large number of matters from I think Blacktown Local Court. There are some
thirty six matters that have been referred and the Crown has argued pursuant to
Drug Court Act
that there is an offence which is an ineligible offence
pursuant to the Act, that is that because the applicant is charged with this
particular offence, he is not eligible pursuant to
(2) (b)of the
(2) (b) says that a person is not eligible, to enter a Drug
Court treatment programme, or eligible to be sentenced under the Drug
legislation, if that person charged with an offence involving violent conduct or
sexual assault. I have been referred to a
lot of decisions, which I have had a
look at, and it seems to me in this matter it is useful to go back to basics and
look at the
second reading speech, because an offence involving violent conduct
is not separately defined in the legislation. In fact, the legislation
in such a way as to give the Court a fairly broad discretion to make a decision
in relation to eligible offences. In the
Minister’s second reading speech
on the introduction of the Drug Court bill the minister said, “The Drug
Court programme
will only deal with offenders who commit certain categories of
offences. These offences will be mainly non violent theft offences.
offenders who commit sexual offences, and offences involving violent conduct
will not be eligible. The types of offences which
will be included are break,
enter and steal, fraud, forgery offences, offences involving steal from the
person, or unarmed robberies,
provided there is no violence. Possession and use
of prohibited drugs and dealing in quantities of prohibited drugs below the
3. True it is, as has been pointed out in the
arguments in relation to this case, that guidance is very limited, and I think
it does give the Court a fairly wide discretion in looking at each case.
This applicant has been charged with an offence pursuant
to s33B (1) (a) of the
Crimes Act. The charge is number 17 on today’s list, and that charge reads
that “at 4.36pm on
20 August 2003, at Parklea, he did use an offensive
weapon with intent to prevent and hinder the lawful apprehension and detention
of himself”. The essential elements of that offence are firstly that the
accused used an offensive weapon, and in this case
it was a motor vehicle. The
case of R v Hamilton (1993)66A Crim R which I will refer to in greater detail in
a minute, is authority
for the fact that a car is an offensive weapon used in
certain circumstances. The second essential element is that the accused did
with the intention of preventing or hindering the lawful apprehension or
detention of that person. I do not have to make any decision
offence here, because it is a plea of guilty. The situation is that the accused,
the applicant, has pleaded guilty
to that offence, which is an offence that
results from a high speed car chase.
4. The facts of the actual matter
are set out very succinctly in the facts sheet and relate to an incident that
occurred on 20 August
2003. There was a high speed car chase, and the police had
prepared at an intersection road spikes, and otherwise blocked the intersection
with other police vehicles. The facts read that the applicant has continued
along Memorial Avenue, Kellyville, towards Old Windsor
Road, he has crossed to
the incorrect side of the road, as all traffic was stopped, road spikes were
deployed by Constable Crewe
on Memorial Avenue near this intersection. The
applicant, upon seeing the road spikes, has braked harshly, jumped the median
back onto the correct side of the road, Constable Crewe has taken evasive
action to avoid being run over by the applicant. The applicant
has again crossed
the median strip coming within metres of Constable Crewe, and crossed onto the
incorrect side of the roadway and
turned right onto Old Windsor Road. The
applicant has continued west along Old Windsor Road on the incorrect side,
causing a number
of vehicles to take evasive action. The applicant has again
crossed the median strip back onto the correct side of the road, and
pursued further, including the use of Polair. Eventually he was arrested
following a collision.
5. It is the case that the facts in R v Hamilton
are not too dissimilar from this matter, except in Hamiltion, the police officer
shot the driver of the motor vehicle. The Court of Criminal Appeal considered R
v Hamilton in Attorney General’s application
(Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999
No 2 of 2002 (2002) NSWCCA
That application
was by the Attorney General for a guideline judgment concerning sentences
imposed for the offence of assault police
pursuant to s60 (1) of the Crimes Act.
Chief Justice Gleason’s, comments in the matter of R v Hamilton were
quoted in that
latter judgment as “sentencing principal”. As I have
already said the offender in R v Hamilton was charged pursuant to
s33B and the
case is cited because it holds that a car used in a way that offender, and also
the present applicant, used the car,
was an offensive weapon pursuant to the
legislation. And the Chief Justice’s comments in R v Hamilton are useful
to grips with the decision I have to make today, The Chief Justice
says (at 581), “In that regard, I should make it clear that
against s33B which make it unlawful to use an offensive weapon or instrument
with intent to prevent lawful apprehension
are regarded by the Court extremely
seriously. It is incumbent upon the Court in dealing with offences of this
nature to show an
appropriate measure of support for police officers who
undertake difficult, dangerous and usually thankless tasks. The risks that
run by the police officers who were involved in the present case were
substantial, the jury obviously accepted the evidence
of Constable Brown, they
were entitled to do that, and if Constable Brown’s version of what
happened is in this case is to
be accepted, then his life was put at risk by the
appellant. The appellant is very lucky that Constable Brown got out of the way,
otherwise the charges that he should have been facing would have been a deal
more serious.”
6. So this type of matter, the Chief Justice says,
must be regarded as an extremely serious matter. It is relevant in my view to
that this is a provision in the Crimes Act, s33B, which is in Division
6 of the Crimes Act, and that division is headed “Acts
causing danger to
life or bodily harm”, and when one looks at the facts of the present case,
and the actual charge, clearly
that is the situation. In my view, to mount an
argument that this is not an offence involving violent conduct is without merit.
my view, this is a charge that falls fairly and squarely into
Drug Court Act
in that it is an offence involving violent conduct. The
section involved, s33B, of the Crimes Act has various levels, and some offences
are not as serious as others, and in fact some matters may be dealt with
summarily under the section.
This present offence is a table one matter, and
in my view having regard to the actual circumstances of the offence it is
a matter that is excluded from being dealt with pursuant to the Drug
Court legislation.
