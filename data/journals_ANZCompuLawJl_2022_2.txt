A NOTE FROM THE EDITORS
Welcome to the rebirth of
Computers & Law
, the Journal for the
Australian and New Zealand Societies for Computers and the Law (now the
Australasian Society for Computers and
Law). It has been a long time in the
coming but it is now here and with a new look and format and a permanent
As with the evolution of the Australasian Society for Computers and Law
(AUSCL), the journal,
Computers & Law
, was ready for change. Taking
advantage of not only technological developments but also the opportunity of
open access, the journal
provides a range of publication types from fully
refereed Academic Articles to Thought Leadership Essays, and Industry
We think you will agree that the 5 Academic Articles, 3 Thought Leadership
Essays and 3 Industry Reports in this Volume 94 provide
a variety of
opportunities for readers to engage with current issues in the field. The topics
covered include the challenge of copyright
and NFTs, ethical AI and SMEs,
quantum technologies’ impact on society, the copyright protection of data
and data bases, the
Digital Platform Ombud Scheme, explainable AI in healthcare,
self-regulation of social media platforms, cyber insurance and more.
journal is an opportunity for each of the AUSCL Workstreams to report on their
achievements either in the form of Industry Reports
or the submission of a
Thought Leadership Essay while the Academic Articles provide an avenue for the
excellent research being conducted
in our universities and abroad to have a
wider readership and real-world impact.
This volume 94 is published by AustLII Foundation Press which is a new
publishing endeavour of AustLII. We are grateful to AustLII
and especially
Associate Professor Philip Chung and Professor Andrew Mowbray (who have joined
our Editorial Board) for this partnership
and for providing a permanent home for
this and subsequent issues of Computers & Law. With the launch of this
volume, it is our
intention to provide early access to articles online as and
when they are accepted and ready for publication, hence you will notice
special page numbering system. Once an appropriate number of articles, essays
and reports are gathered an issue will be published,
which means we have the
flexibility to publish more than one issue per year (that is per volume). We are
also entertaining the possibility
of publishing special issues as and when they
are requested and approved by the editorial board.
We are now gearing up for the 40
Anniversary issue of
Computers & Law
and look forward to receiving many more submissions
across the three categories. The deadline for submissions will be 15 December
2023 and must follow the
Information for Contributors
described in this
volume including the 4
edition of the
Australian Guide to Legal
Questions and
submissions should be sent to the <editors@auscl.org>.
Meanwhile, we hope you enjoy this volume and we express our gratitude to all
those who have contributed.
