Sentencing Snapshot 292: Sentencing Trends for Trafficking in a Large
Commercial Quantity of Drugs in the Higher Courts of Victoria
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
trafficking in a large commercial quantity of
in the County and
Supreme Courts of Victoria (the higher courts) from 2018-19 to
Adjustments made by
the Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at June 2023 have been
incorporated into the data in this Snapshot.
Detailed data on this and other
offences is also available on
Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981
provides for a set of trafficking offences that distinguishes between large
commercial, commercial and less than commercial
quantities of illicit
This Snapshot examines
the offence of trafficking in a

Trafficking in a large commercial quantity of drugs is an indictable offence
that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or
a fine of up to 5,000
penalty units.
This offence is
a category 1 offence if it was committed on or after 20 March 2017. For this
offence, this classification means that
courts must always impose a custodial
Trafficking in a
large commercial quantity of drugs is also a standard sentence offence if it was
committed on or after 1 February
This means that courts
must take into account that a prison sentence of 16 years represents the middle
of the range of objective
seriousness for this offence.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where trafficking in a large commercial
quantity of drugs was the principal offence, that is, cases
where trafficking in
a large commercial quantity of drugs was the offence that received the most
severe sentence.
Trafficking in a large commercial quantity of drugs was the principal offence
in 1.1% of cases sentenced in the higher courts between
2018-19 and 2022-23.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 94 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of trafficking in a large commercial
quantity of drugs.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
trafficking in a large commercial quantity of drugs by
financial year. There
were 21 people sentenced for this offence in 2022-23, up from 16 in the previous
year. The number of people
sentenced was highest in 2019-20 (28 people) and
lowest in 2020-21 (11 people).
Figure 1 also shows that in the last 3 years, all principal offences of
trafficking in a large commercial quantity of drugs were sentenced
as standard
sentence offences.
There were no people who received a custodial or non-custodial supervision
order for the principal offence of trafficking in a large
commercial quantity of
drugs during the five-year

Figure 2 shows the proportion of people who received
an immediate custodial sentence for the principal offence of trafficking in a
large commercial quantity of drugs. An immediate custodial sentence involves at
least some element of immediate imprisonment or
five-year period, 100% of people were given an immediate custodial sentence, all
of which were imprisonment.

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of

quantity of
drugs from 2018-19 to 2022-23.
principal sentence
is the most serious sentence imposed
for the principal offence in a case at a

Principal sentences of imprisonment
All 94 people who received a principal sentence of
imprisonment received a non-aggregate term of imprisonment. None of these were
combined orders of imprisonment and a community correction order. The lengths of
imprisonment terms for these people are shown in
Figure 3. Imprisonment lengths
ranged from 4 years
years and 4 months,
the median imprisonment length was 9 years and 3 months.
The most common range of imprisonment lengths was 9 to less than 10 years (13

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
All 94 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for the principal offence of
trafficking in a large commercial quantity of drugs
were eligible to have a
non-parole period fixed, and all were given a non-parole period.
Figure 6 shows the lengths of the non-parole periods for people sentenced to
imprisonment for the principal offence of trafficking
in a large commercial
quantity of drugs. Non-parole periods ranged from 2 years and 5 months to 15
years, while the median non-parole
period was 7 years.
The most common range of non-parole periods was 7 to less than 8 years (19
