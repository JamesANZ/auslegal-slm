Introduction
[1] This is the
costs decision following the decision given in
Singleton v Direct Personnel
Services and Anor.
October 2025, the Court ordered:
(a) Judgment for the plaintiff against the first defendant in the sum of
$433,056.28 (inclusive of the Workcover refund of $81,276.60).
(b) Judgment for the plaintiff against the second defendant in the sum of
$490,429.05 (inclusive of the Workcover refund of $81,276.60).
(c) Pursuant to
Law Reform Act 1995
(Qld), the first defendant recover
contribution from the second defendant in the sum of $324,792.21, being 75% of
the judgment against
the first defendant.
December 2021, the plaintiff and the first defendant made a mandatory final
offer to the second defendant to settle the claim
for $500,000 inclusive of the
Workcover refund and other statutory refunds but plus costs and outlays. The
first defendant offered
to contribute $110,000 inclusive of the Workcover refund
to the combined sum. The second defendant offered nil to the plaintiff and
to the first defendant.
Plaintiff’s submissions
plaintiff submits that as regards the first defendant, the
Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003
) operates as a
code regarding costs. The common law principles apply to the second defendant,
subject to any statutory modification
Personal Injuries Proceedings
Uniform Civil Procedure
plaintiff and first defendant made a joint mandatory final offer of $500,000 to
the second defendant on 3 December 2021. The
second defendant’s offer was
nil. It is submitted the plaintiff was required to pursue both defendants at
trial by reason of
the second defendant’s denial of liability and offer of
nil. It is submitted the second defendant should pay the plaintiff’s
on the standard basis and the costs of pursuing the first defendant on the
standard basis. The employment of two counsel was
reasonable in the
circumstances of the trial.
First defendant’s
submissions
[6] The first
defendant is not seeking costs against the plaintiff or the second defendant.
Second defendant’s submissions
[7] The second
defendant submits that the plaintiff’s costs should be awarded against it
on the District Court scale and that
two counsel were not necessary. It is
submitted that acceptance of the joint offer would have required a payment by
the second defendant
of $380,000 and the judgment sum is less than the joint
offer. The quantum of damages here was within the jurisdiction of the District
Court and therefore costs should be awarded on the District Court scale. The
second defendant should not be ordered to pay the plaintiff’s
associated with the claim against the first defendant because it was not
necessary for the plaintiff to pursue its claim against
the first defendant. It
could have accepted the offer of $110,000. It was also reasonable for the second
defendant to pursue its
defence given the plaintiff’s credit issues; the
fact the plaintiff was not forthcoming at trial concerning his international
travel and the pursuit of the third-party claim.
plaintiff’s entitlement to costs in this case as against the first
defendant is regulated by the provisions of the
The award of costs against
the second defendant is subject to common law principles; subject of course to
any regulation by PIPA
or the UCPR.
UCPR provides that the usual rule is that costs follow the event. In this
particular case, there is no reason why the plaintiff should
not have his costs
as against the second defendant. The fact is the second defendant made no offer
to resolve this case and the plaintiff
was forced to pursue the second defendant
[10] However, r
697 UCPR provides:
697 Costs of proceeding in wrong
(3) Subrule (4) applies if the only relief obtained by a plaintiff in a
proceeding in the Supreme Court is relief that, when the proceeding
began, could
have been given by the District Court, but not a Magistrates Court.
(4) The costs the plaintiff may recover must be assessed as if the proceeding
had been started in the District Court, unless the court
otherwise.”
[11] I accept
the second defendant’s submission that the costs should be awarded on the
District Court scale. The amount recovered
was well under an award which could
have been made by the District Court at the time of the commencement of the
proceedings. Also,
one must bear in mind that the plaintiff was not forthcoming
prior to trial about his international travel and gym work.
[12] The next
issue is whether the costs for two counsel should be recovered.
Rule 702(2)
UCPR provides that a costs assessor must allow all costs necessary or proper for
the attainment of justice.

Flanagan J noted with
reference to
that the question is
whether the presentation of a case to ensure a just determination reasonably
requires the services of more than
one counsel. It is the nature and
circumstances of the case that are to be considered. Relevant circumstances
(a) The volume of material.
(b) The number or character of witnesses.
(c) The nature and extent of the cross examination.
(d) The anticipated length of the case.
(e) The complexity of the issues of fact and law.
(f) The extent of preparation.
(g) The involvement of charges of fraud or other serious imputations.
(h) The complexity of the required presentation.
[15] I accept
the plaintiff’s submissions that costs should be recovered for two
following factors are present here:
(a) The plaintiff, the second defendant and the first third
had both senior and junior
counsel. It may be inferred that the case was thought to be of sufficient
complexity to require two counsel.
(b) Originally there were two third
(c) The trial took eight days.
(d) The case was reasonably complex as to the issues of liability, quantum,
contribution and indemnity. The indemnity issues were
said to be complex,
involving not only the issue of contract but also damages for pure economic
(e) The cross examination of the plaintiff was extensive and occurred over two
(f) A number of other witnesses were called, including several medical experts.
(g) I accept there was a division of labour between senior and junior counsel in
terms of preparation.
(h) The final submissions of the plaintiff were 29 pages, the first defendant 28
pages and the second defendant 64 pages.
[17] I consider
the employment of two counsel was necessary for the attainment of justice in
[18] The final
issue is whether the second defendant should pay the plaintiff’s costs of
pursing the first defendant.
plaintiff has referred to a number of single judge decisions regarding this but
of course, each case depends on its own facts.
It is a discretionary matter.
[20] It is to be
noted that the Court of Appeal has held that the WCRA does not preclude an order
that a host employer defendant pay
the plaintiff’s unrecoverable costs
relating to his proceeding against the employer
[21] Similarly,
McMeekin J in
Paskins v Hail Creek Coal Pty Ltd & Anor (No
held that s 316 of the
WCRA did not operate as against a party, other than the employer, and ordered
the non-employer to pay the
costs the plaintiff incurred in pursuing the
[22] I accept
the plaintiff’s submissions. By reason of the defences of the second
and the second
defendant’s offer of settlement of nil, the plaintiff was required to
pursue both defendants in the present
litigation. This position is to be
contrasted with the first defendant’s position, which was to agree to
making a joint offer
with the plaintiff, marginally in excess of the judgment
ordered against the second defendant.
plaintiff was put to the onus and expense of pursuing both defendants to
judgment. This was because of the approach to the
litigation taken by the second
[24] One can
understand why the plaintiff did not accept the first defendant’s offer
and proceed to trial only against the second
defendant, in light of the
allegations made by the second defendant against the first defendant.
[25] The expense
to which the plaintiff was put in pursing the first defendant employer is an
expense that properly falls to be compensated
by way of an order against the
second defendant for costs.
[26] In all of
the circumstances I make the following orders:
second defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of and incidental to the
proceedings on a standard basis on the District Court
scale to be agreed or
second defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of and incidental to pursuing
the first defendant in the proceedings on a standard
basis on the District Court
scale to be agreed or assessed.
plaintiff’s costs be assessed on the basis that the fees of two counsel
(senior and junior counsel) should be regarded as
costs necessary and proper for
the trial and the preparation for the trial.
