NUMBER OF PARAGRAPHS:
REASONS FOR DECISION
is an application filed under
Manufactured Homes
(Residential Parks) Act 2003
(“the Act”) by Ms K Haywood
(“the applicant”) who owns a manufactured home positioned in
Greenbank Gardens
situated at Mt Lindesay Highway, Park Ridge. The applicant
seeks to have set aside as excessive a site rent increase imposed by
owner, Surtie Enterprises Pty Ltd trading as Greenbank Gardens (“the
respondent”).
Tribunal has agreed that it will determine on the papers as a preliminary issue
the narrow point as to whether the respondent
was entitled under the
applicant’s site agreement to issue a notice of site rent increase on a
date other than a three yearly
anniversary of the commencement of the site
preliminary point is to be determined on the basis of the following facts. The
applicant’s site agreement in Form 1 under
Mobile Homes Act
is dated 20 June 1994 and is a
“relevant agreement”
which is taken to be a site agreement for the purposes of the
. Clause 3 in
Part IV Express Terms of the Agreement provides relevantly that:
“...the said licence fee will be reviewed to market on the third
anniversary of the commencement date of the first agreement
to grant a licence
in the park, and at every three yearly anniversary thereafter”.
applicant’s site rent as at the 20 June 2009, which is a three yearly
anniversary of the commencement date, was $118.70
per week. On 31 July 2009 the
respondent issued to the applicant a Notice of Increase in Site Rent to $126.30,
with the increase
stated to be based on a market review undertaken as at the 20
June 2009 and stated to be effective from 1 September 2009.
applicant disputes that $126.30 was the market rent as at 20 June 2009 and
claims that the respondent has in fact imposed a market
rent which existed as at
31 July 2009. Furthermore the applicant claims that the Notice of Increase in
Site Rent dated 31 July 2009
was invalid because the respondent was not entitled
to issue a Notice of Site Rent Increase on that date. The respondent submits
that the determination of the market rent as at 20 June 2009 and the subsequent
issue of a Notice to the applicant regarding her
site fee increase was in
accordance with her licence agreement and the Act. It is submitted that the
applicant’s site agreement
only states that the site fee needs to be
reviewed to market on the third anniversary of the commencement date, being the
2009, and it does not state that the Notice of Increase has to be issued
on that date, nor does it state that the Notice cannot be
issued on another date
after 20 June 2009. It is further submitted that the Notice was issued on 31
July 2009 to make it easier
for the respondent and the applicant, because the
applicant’s annual CPI increase and her three yearly market review would
then be effected from the one date, namely the 1 September 2009. In doing so
the applicant has had an additional 45 days at the
lower rental which is to her
examination of Clause 3 in Part IV Express Terms of the applicant’s site
agreement establishes that there is to be an increase
each year in site rent,
with the increased fee to be determined on 1 July each year by applying a CPI
formula to the licence fee
existing during the preceding 12 month period, and
there is also to be a review to market on the third anniversary of the
commencement
date of the first agreement to grant a licence in the park, and at
every three yearly anniversary thereafter. In accordance with
agreement the relevant date for assessment of market rent was therefore 20 June
2009, but there is nothing in Clause 3 which
requires the respondent to issue on
that date a Notice of Site Rent Increase on the basis of market review. The
Tribunal finds that
the respondent was entitled to issue a Notice of Increase on
the later date of 31 July 2009 based on a purported review to market
as at 20 June 2009.
as to the quantum of a market rent as at 20 June 2009 and as to whether or not a
rent of $126.30 is excessive in all the circumstances
will be determined at the
hearing of the matter.
Tribunal declares that the respondent was entitled pursuant to Clause 3, Part IV
of the applicant’s site agreement to issue
a Notice of Increase in Site
Rent on 31 July 2009 based on a purported market review as at 20 June 2009.
