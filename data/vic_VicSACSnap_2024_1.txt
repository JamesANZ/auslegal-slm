Sentencing Snapshot 285: Sentencing Trends for Armed Robbery in the Higher
Courts of Victoria 2018-19 to 2022-23
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of armed
robbery in the County and Supreme Courts of Victoria (the higher courts) from
2018-19 to 2022-23.
Adjustments
made by the Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at June 2023 have been
incorporated into the data in this Snapshot.
Detailed data on armed robbery and other offences is also available
A person who uses or threatens to use force in order to steal and at the time
has with them a firearm, imitation firearm, offensive
weapon, explosive or
imitation explosive is guilty of the offence of armed robbery. Armed robbery is
an indictable offence that carries
a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of 3,000 penalty
Armed robbery is a category 2 offence if it was committed on or after 28
October 2018 and the offender had a firearm with them at
the time of the
offence, or the victim suffered an injury as a direct result of the offence, or
the offence was committed in company
with others. Courts must impose custodial
sentences for category 2 offences except in particular
circumstances.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where armed robbery was the principal offence,
that is, cases where armed robbery was the offence that
received the most severe
Armed robbery was the principal offence in 7.2% of cases sentenced in the
higher courts between 2018-19 and 2022-23.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 621 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of armed robbery.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
armed robbery by financial year. There were 131 people
sentenced for this
offence in 2022-23, up from 101 in the previous year. The number of people
sentenced was highest in 2018-19 (141
people) and lowest in 2021-22 (101
There was also 1 person who received a non-custodial supervision order for
the principal offence of armed robbery (in 2018-19). They
are not included in
this Snapshot.

an immediate custodial sentence or non-custodial sentence for the principal

custodial sentences was lowest in 2021-22 (79.2%) and highest in 2018-19
(88.7%). Over the five-year period,
85.2% of people were given an immediate
custodial sentence.

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of

The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves
multiple charges, the total effective sentence will be either the same as or
longer than the principal
Principal sentences of imprisonment
There were 490 principal sentences of imprisonment
for armed robbery. Table 2 shows that 435 (88.8%) were non-aggregate

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 490 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for the principal
offence of armed robbery, 389 were eligible to have a non-parole
Of these people, 322 were
given a non-parole period

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for armed robbery face
multiple charges, which are finalised at the same hearing. This section looks at
the range of offences that offenders were sentenced for alongside the principal
offence of armed robbery.
Figure 8 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
armed robbery by the total number of sentenced offences
per person. The number
of sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 37, and the median was 3
offences. There were 132 people
(21.3%) sentenced for the single offence of
armed robbery. The average number of offences per person was 4.0.
