Defining tobacco products (BF-006) [1996] VICSROBF 2 (30 April 1996)
Revenue Rulings
The State Revenue Office is frequently asked to give
advice as to which products are considered to be
tobacco when calculating the licence fees payable
Business Franchise (Tobacco) Act 1974
In particular, questions about the liability for tobacco
licence fees arise when tobacco merchants are selling
or purchasing chewing tobacco, snuff and other
specialised tobacco products.
The State Revenue Office interpretation relies on the
provisions of section 2 of the Act.
For the purposes of calculating licences fees,
tobacco is any part of the tobacco plant prepared
for consumption, and any mixture containing
tobacco intended for consumption. Any wrapping,
package or container in which the tobacco was sold,
purchased, received or handled is also considered
to be tobacco prepared for consumption.
Consumption includes smoking, inhaling, chewing,
or sucking.
Therefore cigars, cigarillos, pipe tobacco, ‘roll-your-
own’ tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, ‘smokefree’
tobacco, beadies and herbal cigarettes with tobacco
contained in them must be treated as tobacco for
the purposes of the Act. However nicotine
impregnated patches, tablets and gum are not
considered to be tobacco in this context.
When calculating the licence fee, the cost of the
packaging material surrounding tobacco products
may not be separated from the tobacco leaf
element. Unusual containers, such as expensive
ornamental cigar boxes, must be included unless the
State Revenue Office authorises otherwise.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of law.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be
read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
