[1] Each defendant, Mr Townsend, Mr Babington, Mr Tredinnick and Mr Dymock are
charged by complaint with an offence under s 699 (General
obligation to keep
risk to acceptable level) and s 702 (Requirement to comply with safety
management plan) of the Petroleum and Gas
(Production and Safety) Act 2004
[2] Mr Townsend, Mr Babington and Mr Tredinnick have
applied to have their respective complaints struck out on the basis that Stewart
Lynn Bell, the complainant was not the Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health
when the complaints were made.
[3] The issue is whether the
words used to describe the commencement of Mr Bells appointment as the
Commissioner for Mine Safety and
Health mean his appointment started at the
beginning of 22 April 2013 or the beginning of 23 April 2013.
Petroleum and
Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004
[4] Each offence is alleged to have been
committed on 22 April 2012 at an operating plant 32 kilometres east of Roma at
petroleum lease site. Each of the complaints was sworn by the
complainant on 22 April 2013.
[5] Section 837(4) of the Act relevantly
provides that a proceeding for an offence must start within the latter of the
following periods
(i) 1 year after the commission of the offence;
(ii) 6 months after the
offence comes to the complainant’s knowledge, but within two years after
the commission of the offence.
[6] Section 837(2) of the Act relevantly provides that a proceeding for an
offence against Chapter 9, Part 4 of the Act (s 699 and
s 702 are within this
part) “can be started only by complaint of the
Commissioner”

Qld Government Gazette
[9] By Queensland Government
Gazette (Extraordinary) dated 22 April 2013, the complainant was appointed
Commissioner in the following
Coal Mining Safety
and Health Act 1999
APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR MINE
SAFETY AND HEALTH NOTICE (No 01) 2013
Short title
1. This notice may be cited as the Appointment of the Commissioner for Mine
Safety and Health Notice (No1) 2013
Appointment of the Commissioner [s73A(2)
of the Act]
2 Stewart Lynn Bell is appointed as Commissioner for Mine
Safety and Health for a term commencing from the day of publication of
gazette notice up to and including 31 March 2014.
[10] For the complaints to be valid, the complainant must have been the
Commissioner at the time of their making on 22 April 2013.
The Defendants
[11] The defendants submit by choosing to use the word
“from” the notice of appointment of Mr Bell should be interpreted
excluding the 22 April 2013, the day of publication of the gazette. They submit
that intention is further evidenced by the choice
to expressly use words of
inclusion to denote the end date of Mr Bell’s appointment.
defendants rely on Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited
[1972] HCA 61
(1972) 127 CLR 421.
In Jododex the Minister for Mines granted Jododex, a mining company an
exploration licence dated 28 Nov 1968 ‘for a term of
twelve months from
the date hereof ’. On 28 October1969 Jododex applied successfully to renew
the licence. The application
to renew had to be made not later than one month
before the expiry of the licence.
[13] Gibbs J held that at page 440,
“The exploration licence was granted “for the term of 12 months
from the date hereof”, that is, from 28 November
1968. The question is
whether the term commenced at the beginning, or at the end, of that day. Where a
written instrument requires
a period of time to be computed “from” a
specified date, it depends on the true construction of the instrument whether
the date specified is to be included in the period. Generally speaking however,
the date from which the period runs, is excluded,
although there is no rigid
rule to that effect, and “from” is capable of having an inclusive
effect in an appropriate
[14] Counsel for Mr
Tredinnick and Mr Babington submitted there was doubt as to whether the Notice
of Appointment in the gazette was
valid on the basis that the end date of the
appointment was inconsistent with an end date announced departmentally. Upon the
Crown Solicitor producing the Executive Council minute signed by Her
Excellency the Governor which accorded in all respects with
the Notice of
Appointment and Mr Callaghan SC reliance upon s 50 of the Evidence Act 1977 this
point was not pressed.
Statutory Instruments Act 1992
[15] Mr Bell’s
appointment was made under an Act (The Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999
(Qld) and by an Order in Council
(on 11 April
. The appointment was therefore a
“statutory instrument” within the meaning of the Statutory
Instruments Act 1992 –
[16] The Statutory Instruments Act 1992
applies to all statutory instruments – see s 3. The appointment was
therefore one to
which s 32 and s 33 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992 (Qld)
[17] Sections 32 and 33 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992
relevantly provides that –
32 Prospective commencement
Subject to s 34, a statutory instrument commences –
(a) if it is required to be notified under s 47 or published in the gazette
– on the day on which it is notified or published;
(b) if it is not
required to be notified under s 47 or published in the gazette – on the
day on which it is made; or
(c) if a later day or time is fixed in the
statutory instrument- on that day or at that time.
33 Commencement of citation and commencement provisions
(1) The provisions
of a statutory instrument providing for its citation and commencement
commence, by force of this subsection-
(a) if the statutory instrument is
required to be notified under section 47 or published in the gazette- on the day
on which it is
notified or published; or....
[18] Mr Callaghan SC submitted
by operation of s 32(1)(a) and s 33(1)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992
the appointment of
Mr Bell commenced on 22 April 2013 the day it was published
and that Mr Bell was the Commissioner on 22 April 2013. It is submitted
so because the Order in Council deals only with Mr Bells appointment and the
term of that appointment
[19] Mr Callaghan SC submitted that the time of day
Mr Bell became Commissioner is determined by reference to s 15(B) of the Acts
Interpretations Act 1991 (Qld). Section 15(B) provides that if an Act or a
provision of an Act commences on a day, it commences at
the beginning of the
day. Section 15(B) is one of the provisions mentioned in Schedule 1 of the
Statutory Instruments Act (1992)
Qld, which by s 14(1) of the Statutory
Instruments Act authorises the application of s 15(B) to a statutory instrument
same way it applies to an Act.
[20] The defendants submit s 33 of the
Statutory Instrument Act 1992 applies only to the provisions of the statutory
instrument providing
for its commencement, and not to the actual commencement
term of the appointment or alternatively s33 is displaced by virtue of s
the Statutory Instruments Act 1992 which provides that the Act may be displaced
by a contrary intention appearing in any instrument.
[21] The defendants
submit pursuant to s 33(1)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992 the
provisions of the statutory instrument
ie the Order in
providing for its citation and
commencement, commence on 22 April 2013, the day on which it was published.
Section 32 of the Statutory
Instruments Act 1992 provides the statutory
instrument ie the Order in Council commences pursuant to s 32(1)(a) on the day
it is published.
[22] In relation to s33 of the Statutory Instrument
Act 1992 defence counsel rightly drew the distinction, albeit subtle, between
the provisions of the statutory instrument providing for it’s (ie the
statutory instrument) commencement and the commencement
of Mr Bell’s term
of appointment which depends on the wording used to describe it. The statutory
instrument is the Order in
Council and deals with three matters. Firstly in
paragraph 1 its citation and in paragraph 2 secondly Mr Bell’s appointment
and thirdly the term of that appointment.
[23] The wording of the
commencement date of Mr Bells appointment provides that the term of Mr Bells
appointment commences ‘from’
the day of publication but this is
different to the commencement of the Order in Council which by operation of
s32(1) commences on
the 22 April 2013. I note section 33(1) (a) of the Statutory
Instruments Act 1992 uses the expression ‘on the day on which
published’ to designate the day of commencement rather that the words
‘from’ the day on which it is published
[24] Accordingly s32 and
s33 of the Statutory Instrument Act 1992 do not apply to the construction of the
commencement date of Mr
Bell’s appointment.
[25] Mr Callaghan SC relied
on In re Flavell
[1916] SALawRp 3
[1916] SALR 47.
Flavell involved an appeal from an assessment
of estate duty under the Commonwealth Estate Duty Act 1914.
[26] The issue in
Flavell was whether the Act of Parliament operated from the beginning of the day
on which it was assented to, or
only from the moment when Royal assent was
given. It was held The Act took effect from the first moment of the day and
events which
happened later on in the same day (in that case, the death of
Flavell) occurred after the commencement of the Act.
[27] Mr Callaghan SC
also relied upon Dean v Attorney-General of Queensland
[1971] Qd R 391.
claimed a declaration that the proclamation of a State of Emergency and/or the
Order in Council both made on 14 July 1971 and
published in the Queensland
Government Gazette Extraordinary of 14 July 1971 were beyond the power of the
Governor in Council.
[28] An Order in Council was issued for the purpose of
securing the use of the Brisbane Exhibition ground by authorities controlling
football matches between a visiting South African football team and opposing
teams for training and playing purposes, see Stable
proclamation of the state of emergency recited it,
“shall be in force
for the period commencing the fourteenth day of July one thousand, nine hundred
and seventy-one and ending
on the fourteenth day of August one thousand, nine
hundred and seventy-one”
[30] Stable J at 405 met an argument that the
proclamation as required was not in force when the Order in Council was made.
J held by virtue of the now repealed predecessor to s 15B of the Acts
Interpretations Act, s 15(2) in the Acts Interpretations Act
1954 that the
proclamation took effect from midnight on the preceding day and was in
[31] As can be seen the cases of In re Flavell and Dean v
Attorney-General of Queensland are distinguishable from the present facts.
accepted that if the term of Mr Bells appointment commences on 22 April it
commences at the beginning of the first moment of
that day and equally if it
commences on 23 April it commences at the first moment on the 23 April. See s
15B of the Acts Interpretation
[32] Mr Callaghan SC submitted
‘from’ should be given its dictionary meaning, ‘a particle
specifying a starting
knowing the effect of s32 and s33 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992 it
should not be assumed that the Governor in Council
intended ‘from’
to be interpreted by reference to the common law. The difficulty with this
submission is that s 32 and
s 33 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992 do not
address the interpretation of the word ‘from’.
[33] Mr Callaghan
further notes the Notice of Appointment uses specific words of inclusion
‘up to and including’ with
respect to the end date and submits given
s 32 and s 33 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992 there was no necessity to
use express
inclusive language for the commencement date and had there been an
intention to exclude 22 April 2013 the instrument would have said
but not including’. This submission overlooks the words ‘but not
including’ add nothing to the general
recognised legal meaning of the word
‘from’ whereas the expression ‘from and including’
or ‘on and from’ would have
expressed clear inclusive effect.
Consideration
[34] Whether the
period is expressed to begin ‘on’ a particular day or
‘from’ a particular day may be critical
in determining whether that
day is included or not. Many jurisdictions have enacted legislation to provide
that where any period
of time is to date from a given day, act or event, the
time shall unless a contrary intention appears, be reckoned exclusive of such
day or the day of such act or event. See
Acts Interpretation Act
Interpretation Act 1987
, Legislation Act 2001 (ACT) s
151(3), Interpretation Act 1984 (WA) s 61(1)(b), Interpretation Act 1978 (NT) s
28(1), Acts Interpretation
Act 1915 (SA) s 27(1), Acts Interpretation Act 1931
(Tas) s 29(1). The Victorian provision excludes the first day whether
or ‘from’ is used, see Interpretation of
Legislation Act 1884 (Vic) s 44(1).
[35] In Queensland s 38(1) of the Acts
Interpretation Act 1954 excludes the first day if ‘on’ is used and
does not address
the position if ‘from’ is used. Absent a clear
contextual basis it would be inconsistent to conclude ‘from’
be given an inclusive interpretation when the Parliament has given
‘on’ an exclusive quality.
[36] In Associated Beauty Aids Pty
Limited v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia
Barwick CJ held at 668:
“When, as here, a change is to take place
from a stated time, the general “rule” as to the computation of a
of time is not of direct significance, though it is illustrative of the
separating effect of the preposition “from”.
In my opinion it does
not usually have an inclusive but rather an exclusive or separatist quality. But
unquestionably it may have
either. Thus the preposition derives its relevant
quality from the context in which it is found, which includes the purpose which
the document in which it is found is evidently designed to
[37] This reasoning was followed in Forster v Jododex
Australia Pty Limited
[1972] HCA 61
(1972) 127 CLR 421
per Gibbs J at 440, Mason J at
Gibbs J in Jododex, when interpreting the
word “from” in the exploration licence determined there wasn’t
in the nature of the exploration licence that rendered inappropriate
the prima facie exclusory rule of construction
[38] Barwick CJ held in
Associated Beauty Aids there is no universal or general rule and the preposition
‘from’ can have
an inclusive or exclusive quality. The prima
position is that ‘from’ has
an exclusive or separatist quality however there is no binding rule to this
effect if its
true construction dictates an inclusive effect. Where the
interpretation is not prescribed by statute, the answer depends upon ‘the
context in which it is found, which includes the purpose which the document in
which it is found is evidently designed to
[39] Mr Callaghan SC submits
the context of the appointment is a statutory one. That is the Governor in
Council expressed the appointment
intending it to be interpreted by reference to
s32 and 33 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992. Mr Callaghan SC further
the purpose was to compliment Mr Bell commencing his employment on 22
April 2013. The context must derive from all the circumstances.
I do not accept
the context of the terms of the appointment depend upon the construction of s 32
and s 33 of the Statutory Instrument
Act 1992. If I am found to be in error in
the construction of s 32 and s 33 of the Statutory Instrument Act 1992 I
defendant’s submission that s 4 of the Statutory Instrument Act
1992 would operate to arrive at the same result. While the
purpose includes
giving effect to a commencement date, the date Mr Bell actually commenced work
or in this case brought the complaints
can not determine the purpose of the
appointment.
[40] The context, circumstances and purpose of the Order in
are unremarkable. The context of
the appointment is firstly that s 837(2) of the Petroleum and Gas (Production
and Safety) Act 2004
provides that a proceeding for an offence can be started
only by complaint of the Commissioner. Secondly the Commissioner is defined
schedule 2 as the Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health under the Coal Mining
Safety and Health Act 1999 and thirdly the Commissioner
is to be appointed by
the Governor in Council by gazette notice.
The purpose of the Order in Council is to provide for a routine appointment to
the position of Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health
and as usual setting out
the term of the appointment.
[41] The term of the appointment is expressed to
commence ‘from the day of publication’. If the appointment was
to commence ‘from the date of publication’ or ‘from
22 April 2013’ such variations in language are so subtle
as to make any
difference illusory.
[42] In construing the instrument of appointment I find
no features in the context, circumstances or purpose that detract from the
separating effect of the preposition ‘from’. It bears its prima
facie or usual exclusive effect commencing at the start
of 23 April 2013.
Public Service Act 2008
[43] Counsel for Mr Babington and Mr Townsend
applied to have the complaint dismissed on the further alternative basis that as
22 April 2013 the Commissioner Mr Bells appointment pursuant to the Public
Service Act 2008 had not been effected at law and accordingly
Mr Bell was not
authorised to make the complaint pursuant to the Justices Act 1886.
Bremhorst submitted that s 73A(3) of the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999
designates the Commissioner for Mine Safety
as a public service officer employed
under the Public Service Act 2008 but that Mr Bell had to be properly appointed
and employed
under the Public Service Act 2008 to perfect his appointment as
Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health. Mr Callaghan SC submitted
s 73A(3) of
the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999 deemed Mr Bell to be a public service
officer authorised to make the complaint
notwithstanding the terms of or even
the existence of an employment contract.
[45] Mr Bremhorst submitted Mr
Bell’s appointment in the Gazette did not incorporate a notice pursuant to
s 119(2)(b) of the
Public Service Act 2008 and hence Mr Bell was not
“formerly appointed or empowered” pursuant to the Public Service Act
Mr Bremhorst submitted the Notice of
Appointment needed to include the words “Public Service Act 2008”
under or adjacent
to the words ‘Coal Mining Safety and Health Act
1999’ for Mr Bell to be validly appointed under the Public Service Act
[46] Section 73A of the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999
contemplates Mr Bell’s employment as a public service officer
pursuant to
the Public Service Act 2008. Mr Bell was employed in accordance with the Public
Service Act 2008. Section 119(2) (b)
of the Public Service Act 2008 provides
that a notice of appointment must be published in the Gazette. Mr Bell’
appointment
was published in the Gazette.
[47] I accept Mr Callaghan SC
submission that Mr Bells appointment as Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health
was perfected pursuant
to s73A of the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999 and
that pursuant to s 73A he was a public service officer from the time the
his appointment commenced. The fact that the notice did not incorporate a
reference to the Public Service Act 2008 does not
affect the validity of the
notice because s 73A(3) makes express provision for Mr Bells designation as a
public service officer
and for the publication of the appointment. For these
reasons the publication of the Notice of Appointment in the gazette pursuant
s 73A(2) of the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999 complies with the
requirement of s 119(2)(b) of the Public Service Act
[48] The fact that
the term of Mr Bell’s appointment pursuant to his employment contract went
beyond the term of his appointment
by the Governor-In-Council would not be a
reason to impugn the validity of the appointment by the Governor in Council.
[49] Notwithstanding the further submissions made by Mr Bremhorst, the issue
remains, what is the true construction of the commencement
Bell’s appointment.
[50] For the reasons given, Mr Bell’s
appointment started at the commencement of 23 April 2013 and as a consequence Mr
was not the Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health when the complaints
were made. The consequence is that the complaints against
the applicants Mr
Townsend, Mr Babington and Mr Tredinnick are a nullity and are struck
[51] On 10 February I
delivered the above reasons and the matter was subsequently adjourned for final
orders including cost orders.
defendants Mr Townsend, Mr Babington and Mr Tredinnick having been successful in
their applications to have the complaints struck
out have each applied pursuant
to s 158(2) of The Justices Act 1886 (JA) for an order for costs. Section 158 of
the JA enlivens the
award costs. Section 158 is in Part 6 Division 8 of the JA. Regulation 18
Justices Regulation 2004 (the Regulation) is headed “Scale of Costs for
Act, pt 6, div 8 and pt 9, div 1-Act, ss 158B(1)(a)
and s 232A(1)(a)” and
provides, “the Scale of Costs for Pt 6, div 8 and pt 9, div 1 of the Act
is in Schedule 2”.
[52] Schedule 2 of the Regulation provides in s 1
that the Scale sets out in paragraphs (1)(a)and (b) are the only items for which
costs may be allowed under part 6 division 8 of the Act and the amount up to
which costs may be allowed for each item.
The issue on costs
relation to each defendant’s application for costs there are two
(1) should the court exercise its discretion pursuant to s 158(2) of
the JA and order the complainant pay to each applicant defendant
such costs as
to the court seem just and reasonable as allowed for under the scale of costs in
schedule 2 of The Justices Regulation
(2) should the court exercise
its discretion pursuant to s 158B(2) of the JA to allow a higher amount if
satisfied a higher amount
is just and reasonable having regard to the special
difficulty, complexity or importance of the case.
Section 158A of the
Justices Act
[54] Section 158A of JA was inserted as a legislative response
to the decision of the High Court in Latoudis v Casey
[1990] HCA 59
(1990) 170 CLR
[55] Mr Townsend in his application sought an order that the complaint
be struck out. Mr Tredinnick and Mr Babington sought orders
that the complaints
be dismissed. Following the delivery of reasons on 10 February 2014, Mr Byrne
QC, Ms Mellifont QC and Mr Bremhorst
concurred that the correct order would be
the complaints be struck out. Mr Ryan in his submissions on costs submitted
because the
court found the complaints were laid by a person who was not
authorised an order for dismissal of the complaint is the correct order,
invoking the considerations in s 158A(2) of the JA on the application for costs.
Mr Ryan submitted having regard to the matters
listed in s 158A(2) in
particular, s 158A(2)(d) there should be no costs order at all.
complaints are to be struck out as a nullity because Mr Bells appointment as
Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health had
not commenced. I accept the
submission of the defence counsel that in the circumstances, the proper order is
that the complaints
be struck out pursuant to s 158(2) of the JA for want of
[57] Mr Ryan noted the power to award costs under s 158(1)and
(2) is based on an identical discretion and as a matter of practicality
considerations in s158A(2) would be relevant to each discretion. Defence counsel
submitted in determining what is just and reasonable
under s 158(2) of the JA s
158A(1) and(2) have no applicability because s 158A (1) and (2) relate only to
complaints dismissed under
[58] I accept where a complaint is
struck out pursuant to s 158(2), if the Parliament intended the court take into
account the matters
in s 158A(2) it could easily have made clear provision for
that in s 158A(1). Section 158A(1) only refers to s 158(1), an order for
and not s 158(2) an order that
the complaint be struck out. It follows that Latoudis v Casey
[1990] HCA 59
(1990) 170 CLR 534
remains apposite in exercising the discretion to make an award for costs
pursuant to s 158(2) of the JA.
[59] Mr Byrne QC further submits when
determining what is “just and reasonable”
the following
principles should be applied:
(a) costs normally follow the event
(b) costs are an indemnity not a
(c) there is no question of
onus, a successful party has in the absence of special circumstances a
reasonable expectation of obtaining
an order for the payment of
(d) costs can be calculated from
the date of the complaint and summons inclusive of the proceeding
[60] The discretion to award costs pursuant to s 158(2) should be exercised
having regard to the principles set out in Latoudis v
[1990] HCA 59
(1990) 170 CLR 534
namely that costs are not awarded as a punishment to an unsuccessful party.
Costs are compensatory and although there is no general
rule that costs follow
the event ordinarily a Magistrates Court exercising a statutory discretion will
make an order for costs in
favour of a successful defendant. The exercise of the
discretion should not be influenced by an argument that public officers will
deterred from prosecuting cases for fear of incurring
[61] I am satisfied that it is
appropriate to exercise the discretion in s 158(2) of the JA to award costs that
are just and reasonable.
I do so for the following reasons. The defendants were
successful in their application to strike the complaints out. They had put
prosecution on notice of the point they intended to take, there is nothing in
their conduct that ought to disentitle them to
a costs award and the award would
operate as compensation (albeit limited) for the significant costs that I accept
have been incurred.
If I am wrong in the construction of s 158A, giving due
weight to the circumstances and in particular to the considerations in s
(a),(b),(c) and(h) the same conclusion, that it is just and reasonable for the
complainant to pay the defendants costs, is

financial burden which may be substantial, perhaps crippling, by reason of the
bringing of a criminal charge which,
in the event, should not have been brought.
It is inequitable that the defendant should be expected to bear the financial
of exculpating himself or herself...”
[63] In response to this
decision the Parliament enacted s 158B of the JA. Section 158B(1) provides that
in deciding the costs that
are just and reasonable the court may only award
costs for an item allowed and up to the amount allowed under the
[64] Section 158B(2) of the JA provides that a higher amount may be
allowed if the court “is satisfied that the higher amount
is just and
reasonable having regard to the special difficulty, complexity or importance of
[65] In this matter:
(a) The complaint brought against each defendant alleged an offence on 22 April
2012 at an operating plant 32 kilometres east of
Roma at the Santos petroleum
lease site.
(b) Each complaint was sworn by the complainant on 22 April
(c) Each applicant defendant brought a pre-trial application that the
complaint be struck out. The application was heard at Roma on
6 February 2014.
There was no hearing of any evidence of the alleged offence. The application was
determined following an argument
on the construction of the terms of Mr
Bell’s appointment,
(d) On 10 February 2014 the parties were informed
of the reasons acceding to the applications and on 13 February 2014 further
were made about the delivery of submissions on costs pending final
orders pursuant to s 159 of the JA.
(e) After the complaints were issued each
defendant engaged legal representation and very significant costs have been
incurred in
the preparation of the defence of each of the respective complaints
and in prosecuting the pre-trial application to strike out the
complaints. Mr
Byrne QC appeared for Mr Tredinnick, Mr Bremhorst appeared for Mr Babington, Ms
Mellifont QC appeared for Mr Townsend
and Mr Callaghan SC appeared with Mr T
Ryan for the complainant.
(f) Each defendant put the prosecution on early
notice of the basis upon which the complaint was ultimately successfully
challenged.
The costs sought
[66] Mr Tredinnick relies upon an affidavit sworn by his solicitor, Mr Girle. Mr
Girle says the costs incurred by Mr Tredinnick amounted
to $202,336.02 which
Sparke Helmore fees (inc GST) $156,016.32
Disbursements
Counsel’s fees (inc GST) $40,260.00
Mr Girle expresses the
opinion that “the claimable party party costs are $125,000”. Mr
Tredinnick’s fees were calculated
on a computer program called
“Elite” which records the time spent on a file. Mr Girle exhibited a
59 page itemised schedule
of fees listing items between 3 June 2013 and 10
February 2014.
[67] Mr Babington relies upon an affidavit of his solicitor Mr
Grdovich. Mr Grdovich says the costs incurred by Mr Babington amount
$127,837.18 which include:
HWL Ebsworth fees (inc GST)
Counsel’s fees (inc GST) $53,547.93
Mr Grdovich says Mr
Babington’s fees were calculated on a computer program called
“Aderant” which records the time
spent on a file. Mr Grdovich
exhibited a 12 page schedule of fees listing items between 25 September 2013 and
10 February 2014.
[68] Mr Townsend relies on 3 affidavits, 2 by his solicitor
Ms Miller. Ms Miller says the costs incurred by Mr Townsend amount to
$123,363.29 (inc GST) which include:
Clayton Utz fees (inc GST)
Disbursements including Counsel’s fees $33,223.35
Miller exhibited a 31 page schedule of fees listing items between 26 September
2013 and 13 February 2014. Ms Miller engaged Mr
Graham, Costs Assessor to assess
costs on a standard basis. Mr Graham assessed the costs of defending the
proceeding and bringing
the application to strike out the complaint. Mr Graham
applied the Supreme Court scale because it is “the common and accepted
practice”. Mr Graham says he assessed the costs using a similar approach
to the standard assessment of costs in Bell v Unimin
Australia Pty Ltd No.4
[2013] QMC 3.
Mr Graham’s assessment on a standard basis was as
Clayton Utz fees $46,523,58
Counsel Ms Mellifont QC
Costs Assessment $7,000
Telephone postage petties
Total $83,761.08
Ms Miller’s second affidavit sworn on 18
February 2014 included correspondence sent to the solicitor for the complainant,
Wilson Lawyers, offering to compromise “a reduced amount of costs
equivalent to that offered by Mr Tredinnick, that is, an
amount for costs of
$50,000” and “this offer was not accepted”.

[69] The defendants submit

of the JA. Submissions justifying the order made by some or all of the

Commissioner for Mine Safety and Health is a matter of importance to the
administration of justice.

work undertaken in circumstances where the prosecution had been put
notice of the challenge of the validity of the complaint.

consequences to the defendant’s
future employment
• The defendants’ had offered to settle the issue of
• Applying the scale would set an amount that is both unjust and
unreasonable.
[70] The prosecution relies upon Travers v Donagh; Carrey v La
where Wall QC DCJ had reason to
consider the interpretation of the expression “special difficulty,
complexity or importance”.
His Honour held that the expression should be
interpreted to mean “special difficulty, special complexity, or special
importance”,
see para [22]. His Honour cited with approval Randerson J in
Interclean Industrial Services Ltd v Auckland Regional Council [2002]
where the New Zealand High Court held there was no special difficult or
complexity in the particular case citing with
approval the observation of
Tipping J in T v Collector of Customs
“The use of the word
“special” when applied to the concepts of difficulty, complexity and
importance means that
it is not enough simply to say that the case was
difficult, complex or important. The necessary difficulty, complexity or
must be such that it can be said to be significantly greater than is
ordinarily encountered. Similarly the focus on the case itself
means that it is
not enough for the applicant to be able to say that by dint of its features the
case had special importance to him.”
[71] The prosecution relied upon
Sorrensen v Animanto Pty Ltd
Rackemann DCJ rejected a submission that the appeal before the District Court
involved “special difficulty, complexity
or importance” as that
expression is used in s 232A of the Justices Act. In Sorrensen’s case it
was noted the appeal
was never anticipated to occupy more than part of one day
and most of the arguments were advanced in written submissions. I accept
circumstances in Sorensen are similar to the present case. The parties have
referred me to Lucy v OCC Holdings Pty Ltd &
The circumstance in Lucys case are
distinguishable from the present application. Robin QC DCJ found the matter
involved “special
difficulty, complexity or importance” justifying a
higher award where the matter had been argued by Senior Counsel over 4
full” days and having generated hundreds of pages of
submissions.
[72] Ms Mellifont QC has referred to 2 further authorities
Morton v Queensland Police Service
[2009] QDC 233
where Durward SC DCJ
determined an appeal was of special difficulty, complexity and of importance
pursuant to s 232A of the JA. That
case also is distinguishable. In Morton the
appeal raised an issue of the Constitutional validity of an enactment. It
detailed consideration of 109 of the
Constitution
Discrimination Act 1975
(Cwth) and the Liquor Act 1992 (Qld).
[73] Secondly
in Queensland Police Service v McCracken
[2011] QDC 305
Ryrie DCJ awarded costs
in excess of the scale. McCrackens case is distinguishable. The case involved a
Judge exercising a discretion
on an appeal pursuant to s 232A of JA. It is
distinguishable because of the unusual history leading up to the appeal. The
came on before Judge Ryrie on 7 Feb 2011. The appeal by police from a
costs order was out of time.
The appeal was
adjourned to Nov 2011. When it came on in Nov the appeal was not prosecuted. Her
Honour at [14] took the view that
while the appeal would not have involved any
complexity or special difficulty ‘per se’ it would have necessitated
counsel. Her Honour said ‘That is to say, the matter was of
sufficient complexity and importance to justify an award above
the scale amount
to be awarded’. By the time of the particular appeal significant costs
were incurred by the Respondent and
her Honour concluded the case was or had
become of such importance that a higher award was justified. The Regulation does
a distinction between costs incurred by solicitors or counsel. Whilst
the involvement of counsel may be an indicator that the issue
may have special
difficulty, complexity or importance it is not determinative. As Judge Wall QC
in Travers Case noted at [27], at
the end of the day each case is different and
each case depends on its own facts and the issues involved.
[74] The issue in
this case involved a determination as to the construction of the Notice of
Appointment. In respect of the importance
of the case the defendants point to
the consequences of a conviction and submit the case is a matter of importance
to the administration
of justice. No doubt the outcome, like any determination
of a complaint of a criminal matter was important to each defendant. Beyond
there was no special importance to the case. Like many cases that come routinely
before this Court where a complaint is issued
on the last day of a permitted
limitation period the focus turned to the authority of the person to issue the
[75] As to whether the application was involved any special
difficulty or complexity various arguments were advanced on the application
the prosecution and defence in support of their contentions, however the case
essentially involved a single issue
interpretation of the word ‘from’ in the context of the construction
of the appointment. It is relevant that all
three defendants took a common
position on the true construction of the appointment and this reduced the
complexity of the matter.
I found there were no features in the context
circumstances or purpose of the language of the appointment which detracted from
prima facie or usual meaning. The prosecution prosecuted the matter in good
faith. The prosecutions unwillingness to compromise on
the costs does not
trigger the discretion to award higher costs. I accept the prosecution
submission that the case did not involve
any special difficulty, complexity or
importance as that expression is understood. .
[76] I accept the prosecution
submission that although the parties except Mr Babington in the present case
chose to brief Senior Counsel
that in itself did not elevate the case to one
satisfying the description of “special difficulty, complexity or
importance”.
I do not consider it
would be just for the complainant
ordered to pay the additional cost of the engagement of Senior Counsel by some
of the defendants. I am also mindful that I
was assisted by Counsels written
submissions. The complexity, difficulty or importance of a matter should not be
viewed artificially
on the basis of the length of the hearing time where written
submissions are relied upon. This may engender reluctance in the parties
valuable court time at the risk of that saved time being used against their
clients in an argument as to whether an issue
is complex, difficult or
[77] Although as indicated by Mason J in Latoudis v Casey in the
passage quoted defendants can be exposed to substantial and crippling
reason of an unsuccessful prosecution and that it is inequitable that they
should be expected to bear the financial burden
of exculpating themselves one
must bear in mind the observations of Shanahan DCJ in Hickey v Crime and
Misconduct Commission judgment
delivered 19 May 2008 where His Honour
“[13] The Queensland Legislature by a series of amendments to
the Justices Act 1886, introduced a regime in relation to the
award of costs
which was clearly intended to replace the principles laid down in Latoudis v
Casey (see Murray v Radford
[2003] QCA 91)...
[43] To my mind, it is clear
that the legislature has limited the discretion to award costs to successful
defendants in criminal prosecutions
as a matter of policy. That policy is based
on the public interest of ensuring that the bringing of proper prosecutions is
not fettered
by the prospects of extensive costs orders being made in the event
of unsuccessful prosecutions. Any award of costs above the scale
must be made
with that principle in mind.”
[78] The defendants submit the award
allows for an amount that is both unjust and unreasonable. The scale is set by
the legislature.
[79] Rackemann DCJ observed in Sorrensen v Animato (supra),
the discretion to award a higher amount of costs is not enlivened simply
the scale would not provide a complete indemnity for costs on a party and party
basis. See also Durrant v Gardner
[2000] QDC 198
Cost of Counsel
as a disbursement
[80] The defendants have submitted the costs of Counsel
should be included as a disbursement allowable under schedule 2 part 3 item
the Justices Regulation. This item is headed ‘Disbursements, other than
witnesses for attending’ provides that
‘Court fees and other fees
and payments (other than allowances to witnesses to attend proceedings)
including allowances to interpreters,
and travelling, accommodation and other
expenses of a lawyer acting as an advocate, may be allowed to the extent they
have been reasonably
incurred and are paid or payable’
Mellifont QC refers to the definition of disbursement in the Encyclopaedic
Australian Legal Dictionary as being ‘a payment
which a solicitor in the
true discharge of his or her duty is bound to make whether the client furnishes
the solicitor with money
for the purpose, with money on account or not’.
Fees of Counsel were accepted as a disbursement in Re Remnant
[1849] EngR 776
[1849] 50 ER 949
at 953. In Legal Services Commission v Dempsey
[2007] QSC 270
Chesterman J
referred with approval to Re Remnant and said at [35],
‘Disbursements’ is a term which at least since 1849, has had a
particular and well understood legal meaning. It is
to be expected that the
draftsman of s 481C intended the word when used in the section to have that
meaning. As O’Connor J
said in Attorney-General (NSW) v Brewery Employees
Union of New South Wales
[1908] HCA 94
(1908) 6 CLR 469
‘Where words
have been used which have acquired a legal meaning it will be taken prima facie,
that the legislature has
intended to use them with that meaning unless a
contrary intention clearly appears from the context. To use the word of Denman J
in R v Slator...”but it always requires the strong compulsion of other
words in an Act to induce the court to alter the ordinary
meaning of a well
known legal term”
[82] It was
submitted the Justices Regulation does not contain such ‘strong compulsion
of other words’ and ‘disbursement’
should be given its well
understood legal meaning.
[83] This submission cannot be accepted for these
reasons. The legislature has clearly intended to limit the definition of
disbursement
from the language used in Part 3 of schedule 2 of the Justices
Regulation. The disbursement is limited to court fees and payments
respect to lawyers allows specifically ‘travelling accommodation and other
expenses’. The legislature has clarified
the position by specifically
enacting item 2 of part 1 of schedule 2 which provides, “An item in part 2
covers all legal professional
work, even if the work is done by more than one
lawyer”. There is no distinction drawn between solicitor and counsel. If
was to be a distinction and counsels fees for legal professional work were
to be recovered as a disbursement such would be found
in the language of
schedule 2.
The context Chesterman J spoke
of in Demseys case is, in respect of costs and disbursements, the context
Shanahan DCJ spoke of in
Hickeys case. No authority was cited in support of the
submission and I am unaware of any.

complexity or importance of the case I
