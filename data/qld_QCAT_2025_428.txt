APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
REASONS FOR DECISION
matter has been referred to the Tribunal in respect of a number of allegations
concerning the conduct committed by the respondent
between 16 February 2010 and
12 May 2021. This includes a period before the
Health Practitioner Regulation
National Law (Queensland)
National Law
’) came into
effect on 1 July 2010, but the effect of the relevant savings and transitional
provision in the former regulations
mean the conduct of this referral is
governed by the National Law despite some of the conduct occurring before its
introduction.
material times, the respondent was a registered medical practitioner with
specialist registration in general practice.
He provided general practice
services at a practice owned by him.
[3] There are
four grounds before the Tribunal. The allegations generally relate to the
respondent's treatment of four patients between
February 2010 and May 2021. A
treating relationship existed between the respondent and four patients as
(a) AB – between 16 February 2010 and 12 May 2021;
(b) JJ – between 10 June 2015 and 12 May 2021;
(c) MM – between 7 September 2015 to the present; and
(d) TA – between 20 December 2012 and 12 May 2021.
[4] In broad
compass, it is alleged that the
respondent:
(a) inappropriately prescribed Schedule 4 drugs of dependence and Schedule 8
medications to those patients mentioned above (‘
(b) failed to provide appropriate care to those patients (‘
(c) inappropriately terminated the treating relationship with those patients
between December 2020 and January 2021 and ceased providing
them the Schedule 4
drugs of dependence and Schedule 8 medications (‘
(d) failed to maintain adequate clinical records for those patients
ground four
particulars of the allegations in respect of grounds one, three, and four appear
in Annexure B to the referral. In relation
to ground two, the particulars appear
in a further amended ground two of the referral, filed in the Tribunal on 10
September 2025
further amended ground two
response on 21 February 2025, the respondent accepted the allegations in grounds
one, three, and four, and accepts that
the conduct amounted to professional
misconduct.
[7] In respect
of ground two, the parties have advised they have resolved all factual disputes
in respect of that ground. The parties
accept this is of course subject to the
Tribunal’s satisfaction in respect of those matters, and accept that while
matter for the Tribunal, the fact that the allegations and
characterisation are agreed is a significant matter upon which ‘
can and should be given
Here, bearing in mind the
onus of proof and the evidence, the Tribunal accepts the resolution and the
agreement between the parties.
In the further amended ground two, the parties
agree that the conduct set out in the amended allegations constitutes
unprofessional
conduct within the meaning in section 5 of the National Law. By
way of the further amended ground two, the Tribunal was amenable
to proceeding
on the papers.
18 March 2021, the Office of the Health Ombudsman received a confidential
notification regarding the respondent's conduct.
It raised concerns about his
abrupt cessation of the provision of medication to the four patients
[9] On 22 July
2021, the Medical Board of Australia (‘
’) took immediate
action pursuant to section 156(1)(a) of the National Law by way of imposing
conditions on the respondent's
registration. Those conditions prohibited the
respondent from accessing and prescribing, among other things, any Schedule 8
medications
and any Schedule 4 drugs of dependence. The respondent was required
to submit to regular audits of his practice.
[10] As I said
earlier, section 5 of the National Law provides definitions of professional
misconduct and unprofessional misconduct.
There are several decisions which the
Tribunal is empowered to make in light of those findings. Here, the applicant
argues it is
open to the Tribunal to conclude that a global finding is
appropriate in respect of the respondent's conduct and that the Tribunal
characterising the conduct as professional misconduct. The appropriate sanction
is to be considered at the time of making
the sanction and not at the date of
the conduct.
[11] The purpose
of disciplinary proceedings is protective and not punitive, which is a
significant factor. One of the protections
is the making of orders which secure
the maintenance of proper professional standards.
[12] I note that
the respondent:
(a) has been compliant with the conditions placed on his practice for at least
four years;
(b) has cooperated and been candid with the Board;
(c) is seen generally as a hard-working and competent physician; and
(d) has undertaken rehabilitation and education which speaks to his insight and
remorse, reducing the need for specific deterrence.
[13] Comparable
cases have been referred to the Tribunal. No two cases are exactly the same, but
comparable cases can be useful in
determining the outer limits of the
appropriate sanction.
[14] It must be
said that the conduct of the respondent occurred over a lengthy period and was
conduct which exhibited a serious disregard
for the requirements of professional
practice. He repeatedly put his patients at risk by inappropriately prescribing
medications
and drugs of dependence, and that risk was magnified by his abrupt
cessation of the treating relationships with those patients to
prescribed the medications and drugs of dependence. In
Health Ombudsman v
[2021] QCAT 43
the Tribunal determined that similar conduct involving
inappropriate prescribing and clinical observations and the failure to keep
proper records in relation to one patient over a five-year period constituted
professional misconduct. In making that determination,
the Tribunal
The inappropriate prescribing and inappropriate clinical observations and
failure to keep proper records over so many years in relation
to an extremely
vulnerable patient is clearly professional misconduct, bearing in mind that it
is the responsibility of the applicant
to prove it to the standard identified in
Briginshaw v Briginshaw
[1938] HCA 34
(1938) 60 CLR 336
at 361-362.
The prescription of medication (and in particular schedule 4 drugs and/or drugs
of dependency) without proper clinical indication
is a serious matter given the
trust placed in medical practitioners by the public. A failure to comply with
the regulation, of itself,
can lead to professional misconduct.
protection of the public and the reputation of the profession should carry
significant weight when determining an appropriate
sanction. In
Health Care
Complaints Commission v Do
[2014] NSWCA 307
the court observed at
The objective of protecting the health and safety of the public is not confined
to protecting the patients or potential patients
of a particular practitioner
from the continuing risk of his or her malpractice or incompetence. It includes
protecting the public
from the similar misconduct or incompetence of other
practitioners and upholding public confidence in the standards of the
profession.
That objective is achieved by setting and maintaining those
standards and, where appropriate, by cancelling the registration of
practitioners
who are not competent or otherwise not fit to practise, including
those who have been guilty of serious misconduct. Denouncing such
operates both as a deterrent to the individual concerned, as well as to the
general body of practitioners. It also maintains
public confidence by signalling
that those whose conduct does not meet the required standards will not be
permitted to practise.
[16] Dependence
on prescription medication is a well-known problem in the community and the
deterrence of medical practitioners who
willingly or ignorantly enable such
dependency is a significant consideration. The conduct here occurred over a
prolonged period
and in relation to multiple patients; it continued even after
the respondent had been put on notice by Queensland Health that concerns
in relation to his prescribing practices regarding Schedule 8 medications for
three of the patients.
addition, the respondent has had one previous compliance incident which resulted
in a caution.
[18] In his
favour, he has shown insight into his conduct and undertaken significant
education and mentoring during the investigation
period. As I said earlier, he
has been compliant with the conditions imposed on him for over four years. The
Board submits that the
appropriate sanction would include the
(a) an order that the respondent be reprimanded;
(b) an order suspending the respondent from practice for six months; and
(c) an order that upon returning to practice the respondent's registration be
subject to an audit condition.
respondent's position is that there should be a reprimand and an order
suspending him from practice for a period of three
months. Having considered the
comparable cases suggested by both parties and bearing in mind the need to
promote consistency of decision-making
within the national scheme, the Tribunal
has come to the view that the appropriate sanction in this case should take into
(a) the comparable cases;
(b) the respondent's extensive participation in an educational program and his
reception of mentoring;
(c) his remorse; and
(d) the extra condition that the respondent’s registration be subject to
an audit condition with a review period of 12 months.
