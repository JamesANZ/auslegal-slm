Family violence victims are victims of crime.
As recognised by the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence, the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act) has a role in
also recognised by the
Royal Commission, victims of family violence face
significant barriers in accessing the Act.
On 22 December 2016, the Victorian Attorney-General, the Honourable Martin
Pakula MP, asked the Victorian Law Reform Commission (the
Commission) to review
and report on the provision of state-funded financial assistance to victims of
family violence under the Act.
The reference to the Commission is a small but important part of the
Victorian Government response to the recommendations of the Royal
Commission.
The reference seeks answers to the question: what changes should be made to
the Act to better assist victims of family violence rebuild
their lives and
recover? The answer must be tempered by the need to ensure the Act provides an
appropriate balance between the rights
of victims and
procedural fairness, including where the alleged perpetrator has not been
prosecuted or convicted.
The issues raised by this reference will attract a range of views, and the
Commission will be consulting widely with victims, persons
professionals, stakeholders and the community. This consultation paper is
therefore an important step in the Commission’s
consultation process.
I warmly encourage anyone with an interest in the issues discussed in this
paper to make a written submission to the Commission by
28 July 2017.

Introduction
22 December 2016, the Attorney General, the Hon. Martin Pakula MP, asked the
Victorian Law Reform Commission (the Commission) to
review and report on the
provision of state-funded financial assistance to victims of family violence
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act). The terms
of reference ask the Commission to consider five specific matters raised by the
Victorian Royal Commission
into Family Violence (the Royal Commission). These
are outlined below. In this consultation paper, the Victorian Royal Commission
will be referred to as the Royal Commission, unless the context otherwise
Act established the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal (VOCAT) which
determines applications for financial assistance. The operation
of the Act and
VOCAT are the main focus of this consultation paper.
issues raised by this reference are outlined below. Detailed discussion of these
key issues is in Parts Two and Three of this
consultation paper. Part One
provides background and contextual information only, and does not raise specific
consultation questions.
Eligibility for assistance
terms of reference ask the Commission to consider the eligibility test and
whether this should be expanded to include victims
of family violence where a
pattern of non-criminal behaviour results in physical or psychological injury.
This is discussed in detail
in Chapter 6.
5 A person is eligible for financial assistance under the Act if
they are the ‘primary’,
‘secondary’ or ‘related’ victim of an ‘act of
violence’ that directly results in their suffering
injury, death or a
significant adverse effect.
categories of victims are eligible for different kinds of assistance. However,
in all cases there must have been an ‘act
of violence’. Under the
Act, an act of violence is defined as a ‘criminal act’ or ‘a
series of related criminal
acts’ that occurred in Victoria
that ‘directly resulted in injury or death to one or more persons’.
Criminal acts include assault, injury, threats,
sexual offences, stalking, child
stealing, kidnapping, conspiracy
and attempts of these offences. The act of violence must directly result in
injury, that is, actual physical bodily harm, mental illness
or disorder (or
exacerbation of) and pregnancy.
‘Injury’ does not include injury arising from property loss or
financial assistance can also be claimed if a victim has suffered a
‘significant adverse effect’, defined as
any grief, distress, trauma
or injury as a direct result of the act of violence. This is described as
‘special financial assistance’
in the Act.
main issues facing victims of family violence with respect to the eligibility
criteria are the definition of ‘act of violence’,
the definition of
‘injury’, causation and the victim categories.
act of violence requirement means that victims of family violence are only able
to access financial assistance if they have experienced
physical or sexual
violence, a threat
of injury, or stalking. Victims of non-criminal
forms of family violence, such as economic, emotional and psychological abuse
excluded, as are victims of family violence that is criminal in nature but
not an offence against the person. The definition of act
of violence is much
narrower than the definition of family violence in the
Family Violence
Protection Act 2008
10 Another potential barrier for victims of family violence is the definition
of injury. If
a victim of family violence has not suffered physical injury or does not
suffer from a mental disorder or illness, they may be ineligible
for assistance.
There are cases where victims of family violence, who have experienced
significant mental harm, have had
their applications refused because they do not suffer from a recognised
mental illness or disorder.
of family violence can also encounter difficulties in establishing that their
injury was a direct result of the act of violence,
particularly if there may be
other contributing factors.
addition, the distinction between primary, secondary and related victims can be
problematic for child victims of family violence.
Children who experience family
violence can suffer severe psychological and developmental trauma and
consequences. This is equally
the case for child victims who are the direct
subject of the violence and those who hear, witness or are otherwise exposed to
However, under the Act, this second group
of child victims are
not recognised as primary victims. This not only has the potential to fail to
acknowledge and recognise their
experience of family violence but it also
affects the categories and quantum of awards that they receive.
address the above issues, the Commission will consider whether family violence
could be defined in the Act and whether the Act
could be amended to expand the
range of injuries covered by it. Alternatively, or additionally, the Commission
will consider whether
the Act could be amended to include a broader range of
injuries for victims of family violence or to remove the requirement for proof
of injury for victims of family violence.
Assistance available
terms of reference ask the Commission to consider, within the total financial
assistance available, the categories and quantum
of awards with regard to the
cumulative impact of family violence behaviour on victims. This is discussed in
detail in Chapter 7.
15 The Act limits the amount of assistance that can be awarded to a
particular victim.
The maximum award for primary victims is $60,000 plus $10,000 of special
financial assistance. The maximum award for secondary victims
and any one
related victim is
$50,000. There are different categories of award available to primary,
secondary or related victims.
are three main categories of award that primary victims can
access—expenses actually incurred or reasonably likely to
be incurred; in
exceptional circumstances, an amount for other expenses actually incurred or
reasonably likely to be incurred to
assist in recovery; and special financial
assistance.
17 Special financial assistance is a lump sum awarded as a symbolic
expression by the
state of the community’s sympathy and recognition of harms suffered.
Special financial assistance is classified into four categories,
A, B, C and D,
based on the severity of the act of violence, with Category A covering the most
serious offences and Category D the
criminal acts can be treated as a single act of violence, which can limit awards
available to some victims of crime.
main issues facing victims of family violence, including child victims, with
respect to the financial assistance available are
the related criminal acts
provision and the categories of special financial assistance.
20 The related criminal acts provision can disproportionately
reduce the awards for victims
of family violence, including child victims, because family violence often
involves repeated acts of abuse by the same offender, which
is a factor relevant
to whether acts are considered related.
have also been raised that the special financial assistance categories do not
sufficiently take into account the cumulative
harm of individual acts of
violence because the relevant categories are based on the severity of a single
offence, rather than the
overall impact of a pattern of abuse.
address the above issues, the Commission will consider whether the related
criminal acts provision and the special financial assistance
categories could be
amended. This could involve adding further criteria when assessing related acts,
excluding family violence from
the operation of the related criminal acts
provision entirely, or amending the Act so that only acts of violence committed
same time are considered related.
Commission will also consider how the Act could be amended to take into account
the cumulative harm of family violence, including
to children, by amending the
special financial assistance categories to enable a higher award for a series of
acts of family violence.
Another option is to incorporate a ‘pattern of
family violence’ into one of the higher categories. The Commission will
also consider adopting separate categories for family violence or removing the
categories of special financial assistance entirely,
enabling VOCAT to consider
family violence and other factors to determine awards up to the maximum
Form and timing of applications
Royal Commission specifically identified the time limit for making an
application as a potential barrier for victims of family
violence. This is
discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
application for assistance to VOCAT must be made in writing in the prescribed
form within two years of the act of violence occurring.
VOCAT is obliged to
strike out applications made outside this two-year time limit, unless they
consider it appropriate not to strike
the application out.
were raised that the VOCAT application form is tailored towards victims of a
one-off act of violence making it difficult
for victims of family violence to
complete. The application time limit was also raised as a significant
can take victims of family violence a long time to disclose their experiences of
family violence. The reasons for this are varied
and complex. The fact that it
may take a victim of family violence longer to lodge an application for
assistance means that the time
limit of two years can have a disproportionate
impact on their eligibility.
address these matters, the Commission will consider how the application form
could be made more accessible for victims of family
violence by using language
that is not confined to singular acts of violence. The Commission will also
consider how the Act could
be amended to remove difficulties in relation to the
time limitation, such as increasing the time limit for applications relating
family violence or making family violence an explicit factor that VOCAT must
consider when making a decision about
whether or not to strike out a
late application. A further option is to remove the time limit for victims of
family violence.
VOCAT hearings
terms of reference require the Commission to consider the requirement to notify
a perpetrator, especially where the matter has
not been reported to police, or
no charges have been laid, or the prosecution is discontinued or the person is
acquitted. This is
discussed in detail in Chapter 9.
the Act, VOCAT may give notice of a hearing to any other person whom it
considers to have a legitimate interest in the matter,
including an alleged
perpetrator
who may also elect to appear at a hearing. Some
procedural protections already exist for victims in these circumstances under
Act. VOCAT has issued a Practice Direction on the procedure to be followed
in these circumstances.
31 VOCAT may also determine an application without a hearing.
main issue raised concerns notification of alleged perpetrators, due to the
safety risks that commonly arise in applications involving
family violence.
perpetrators are sometimes notified and may participate in proceedings. This
can be a deterrent for victims of family violence
to apply to VOCAT.
34 Given these issues, the Commission will consider whether the Act
could be amended
to remove the notification provision, either entirely or specifically for
vulnerable victims, such as family violence victims. However,
this consideration
also raises concerns about procedural fairness.
option is to amend the Act to explicitly list the safety concerns associated
with family violence as a factor VOCAT must have
regard to when considering
whether to notify an alleged perpetrator, as well as strengthening existing
evidentiary and procedural
protections.
Making an award
terms of reference require the Commission to review the matters giving rise to
refusal of an application for financial assistance
except in special
circumstances. These matters
are outlined in sections 52, 53 and 54
of the Act. This is discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
section 52 of the Act VOCAT must refuse to make an award if an act of violence
was not reported to police within a reasonable
time or the applicant failed to
provide reasonable assistance to police or prosecution, unless special
circumstances exist.
54 of the Act also requires VOCAT to consider a number of other specified
matters including the character, behaviour (including
past criminal activity)
and attitude of the applicant before, during and after the act of violence. This
includes any provocation
‘condition or disposition’
of the applicant that may have contributed to the injury. These are sometimes
referred to as
‘contributory conduct’ or ‘provocation’
clauses. VOCAT must also consider whether a perpetrator will benefit
main issues raised relate to the requirements to report to police, to assist
police and prosecution, the contributory conduct
and provocation clauses, and
the perpetrator benefit provisions. Many of these provisions have complex case
law interpretation of
determining whether an act of violence was reported to police within a
reasonable time, case law indicates differing interpretations
considered a reasonable time for reporting and also differing interpretations of
what might result in special circumstances
mitigating a delay in reporting. This
can lead to uncertainty in cases of family violence where a delay in reporting
to police is
often a characteristic.
relation to whether a victim provided reasonable assistance to police or
prosecution, there are no prescribed positive actions
a victim must undertake.
However, guidance in the VOCAT application form indicates victims must report
the matter to police, make
a formal report and sworn statement. Due to the
nature and dynamics of family violence, these requirements can be problematic
victims of family violence.
circumstances can mitigate a failure to provide reasonable assistance to police
and prosecution. However, special circumstances
require something out of the
ordinary and some case law decisions have emphasised family violence is a common
circumstance.
addition to the above issues, contributory conduct clauses have been criticised
as victim blaming in family violence cases and
the Act provides no guidance
issues together raise concerns that the Act fails to recognise the dynamics and
characteristics of family violence. To address
this, the Commission will
consider how the Act could be amended to recognise family violence for the
purposes of sections 52, 53
Suggestions
include an overarching provision which enables, or requires, VOCAT to consider
the nature and dynamics of family violence
when making a determination,
exempting victims of family violence from some of the considerations under these
provisions, or amending
specific provisions to more explicitly reference family
VOCAT procedures and time frames
terms of reference require the Commission to consider procedural matters to
expedite the making of an award. This is discussed
in detail in Chapter 11.
47 VOCAT must act ‘expeditiously’ (that is, promptly)
to determine applications. Close to
50 per cent of all VOCAT applications are finalised within nine months.
receiving relevant documentation, VOCAT may determine an application with or
without conducting a directions hearing or a final
hearing, depending on the
preference of the applicant, as well as the Tribunal’s need for a hearing.
In practice, many straightforward
applications are decided without the need for
a hearing. More complex cases are usually determined at a hearing.
main issue raised in relation to time frames relates to the fact that although
VOCAT must act promptly, it must also have regard
to matters that can sometimes
affect the time it takes to finalise an application, including awaiting the
outcome of a criminal
investigation, trial or inquest. The Tribunal
has also observed an increase in the complexity of applications, particularly
to family violence which impacts timeliness.
in determining VOCAT applications relating to family violence can have profound
impacts on victims. Financial hardship can
be a significant consequence of
family violence and the economic impacts of family violence can impede a
victim’s ability to
leave an abusive relationship and obtain safety.
considering procedural matters to expedite the making of an award, the
Commission will consider options such as case triaging,
development of a
Practice Direction to clarify some more complex provisions of the Act, a
separate family violence stream and VOCAT
specialisation for magistrates.
Commission will also consider the benefits of administrative models where
commissioners or government assessors make determinations,
as well as the
connection between VOCAT and other support agencies. Consideration is also given
to how interim awards could better
reflect the administrative and case
management processes used in making other awards of assistance, such as family
violence flexible
support packages which are administered by government-funded
community organisations.
Review, variation and refund of awards
limited data and information is available with respect to review and refund of
awards, variation has been raised as a concern
for family violence victims.
Review, variation and refund of awards is discussed in Chapter 12.
has broad discretion to vary awards, although variations must be consistent with
the Act. For example, an award must still assist
a victim’s recovery from
the act of violence.
2015–16, VOCAT varied 986 awards for expenses already incurred and 588 for
expenses not yet incurred.
main issues raised concern variation of awards. Family violence victims
frequently require variations, particularly in relation
to additional
counselling. The variation process is not always easy and can be complicated by
the need to repeatedly engage a lawyer.
the same time, variation allows VOCAT to assist victims as their needs and
circumstances change.
Commission will consider the usefulness of award variations in addressing the
specific needs of family violence victims and what,
if any, barriers may have
been experienced by victims during the variation process.
VOCAT awareness and accessibility
have been raised that there are relatively few VOCAT applications compared to
the number of reported incidents of family
violence in Victoria. This raises
issues of awareness and accessibility of VOCAT. This is discussed in detail in
Chapter 13.
there is limited data available which provides a comprehensive picture of the
number of family violence victims who use VOCAT,
the Royal Commission found that
some victims were unaware of their eligibility under the Act.
Act has also been described as complex and difficult for victims to understand.
A victim’s experience of VOCAT is therefore
likely to be enhanced by
victim support and the availability of legal representation.
VOCAT has close links with support agencies, these support mechanisms are not
integrated with VOCAT. Some Australian states
and territories have combined
victim support and compensation/financial assistance schemes which aim to
connect information, support
and financial assistance.
Commission raises issues of awareness and accessibility to determine whether
other changes or reform might be required to support
possible legislative
Commission will consider how aspects of the current system work together,
including VOCAT, lawyers, victim support and family
violence services, and how

VOCAT—beyond financial assistance
assistance and compensation go beyond monetary benefits—they can make a
statement to the community about the unacceptability
of family violence and the
process itself can help recognise a victim’s experience.
66 However, at the time of the introduction of the Act, in
1996, there was little community acknowledgment of family violence
or its harms.
As such, family violence is not explicitly recognised under the Act.
67 These issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 14.
68 The main issues raised relate to the potentially therapeutic aspects of
VOCAT and the
Act’s lack of recognition of family violence.
is one of the few Australian jurisdictions that uses judicial decision makers.
For some victims, this provides an acknowledgment
from the justice system that
there has been a crime and that they have suffered harm. However, research has
found that this
is not the experience of all victims of crime. The
Commission has been advised that one of the reasons the VOCAT process can be
retraumatising
for victims is because it is not a trauma-informed process.
addition, the Act’s failure to recognise family violence—or to
conceive of family violence itself as an act of violence—remains
the fundamental challenges of ensuring the Act appropriately responds to harms
caused by family violence.
address these issues, the Commission will consider how trauma-informed practice
could underpin any possible changes to the Act
or VOCAT procedures.
Consideration could also be given to how VOCAT could be more integrated with the
support system, particularly
given the models in other jurisdictions that
combine compensation and victim support.
Commission will also consider how broader recognition of family violence could
be incorporated in the Act, such as a general provision
acknowledging the
dynamics of family violence and re-envisaging the Act as applicable in
circumstances involving some forms of family
violence. This would need to
closely mirror any potential changes to eligibility under the Act.
Fulfilment of the purpose and objectives of the Act
purpose of the Act is to provide assistance to victims of crime. The Act also
has a number of further objectives, discussed in
detail in Chapter 14.
first stated objective of the Act is to ‘assist victims of crime to
recover from the crime by paying them financial assistance
for expenses
incurred, or reasonably likely to be incurred, by them as a direct result of the
crime’. The Commission considers
that a number of provisions of the Act
make it difficult for the Act to assist family violence
recover from crime. These include the eligibility criteria, the quantum
generally awarded in family violence matters, application
time limits,
perpetrator notification provisions, requirements to report to and assist
police, as well as VOCAT delays.
second stated objective of the Act is to ‘pay certain victims of crime
financial assistance (including special financial
assistance) as a symbolic
expression by the State of the community’s sympathy and condolence for,
and recognition of, significant
adverse effects experienced or suffered by them
as victims of crime’. The Commission considers that although victims of
violence are sometimes determined to be ‘certain victims’
under the Act, the special financial assistance categories
may not sufficiently
take into account the cumulative harm of individual acts of violence because the
categories are based on the
severity of a single offence, rather than the
overall impact of a pattern of abuse.
the Commission will consider a range of structural, legislative, procedural and
perceived barriers currently limiting VOCAT’s
ability to assist victims of
family violence to recover, thereby impacting the Act’s fulfilment of its
purpose and objectives.
enable the Act to better fulfil its purpose and objectives, the Commission will
also consider how the Act can provide for:
recognition of a
broader definition of family violence—beyond the notion of a single act of
violence and potentially incorporating
non-violent forms of abuse
recognition of
the cumulative harm of individual acts of violence as a result of experiencing
persistent and protracted violence in
a family violence context
acknowledgment
of the difficulties faced by family violence victims in reporting to police,
assisting prosecution and applying for
assistance, without applying prescriptive
time frames
• prioritisation of a victim’s
safety and wellbeing and a trauma-informed approach
more timely
access to financial assistance at the point of crisis and better integration
with existing supports
more flexibility
and adaptability as circumstances change, without further burdening victims with
having to continue to access lawyers
in order to obtain support such as
counselling.

PART ONE: THE CURRENT SYSTEM
Introduction
2 Referral to the Commission
2 The Commission’s approach
1. Introduction
Referral to the Commission
1.1 On 22 December 2016, the Attorney-General, the Hon. Martin Pakula MP,
asked the Victorian Law Reform Commission to review and
report on the provision
of state-funded financial assistance to victims of family violence under the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act
The terms of reference
[Referral to the Victorian Law Reform Commission pursuant to
section 5(1)(b)
Victorian Law
Reform Commission Act 2000
(Vic) on 22 December 2016.]
The Victorian Law Reform Commission is asked to review and report by 31
January 2018 on the provision of State-funded financial assistance
to victims of
family violence under the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
In conducting the review, the Commission should consider the following
matters raised by
Recommendation 106 of the Royal Commission into Family Violence:
1) The eligibility test and whether this should be expanded to include
victims of family violence where a pattern of non-criminal
behaviour results in
physical or psychological injury
2) Within the total financial assistance currently available, have regard to
the categories and quantum of awards with regard to
the cumulative impact of
family violence behaviour on victims
3) The requirement to notify a perpetrator, especially where the matter has
not been reported to police, or no charges have been
laid, or the prosecution is
discontinued or the person is acquitted
4) The matters giving rise to refusal of an application except in special
circumstances
5) Procedural matters to expedite the making of an award
The Commission’s approach
Reference framework
1.2 This reference to the Victorian Law Reform Commission (the Commission) is
part of the response by the Victorian Government to
the recommendations of the
Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence (the Royal Commission).
1.3 Fundamentally, this reference seeks answers to the question: what changes
should be made to the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
better assist victims of family violence rebuild their lives and recover?
1.4 In this consultation paper, the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) is referred to as
‘the Act’ unless the context otherwise requires.
1.5 State-funded financial assistance and compensation to
has been described as a core component of a
just legal response to family violence.
Nations Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against
Women has provided a General Recommendation
for states to develop effective
compensatory provisions to protect women against all violence, including family
Isobelle Barrett Meyering describes the
provision of state-funded financial assistance as good practice within a broader
legal response
to family violence.
The Australian Law
Reform Commission and New South Wales Law Reform Commission have also confirmed
that such schemes are an important
element of victim
1.6 The benefits of state-funded financial assistance for victims of family
violence are both practical and symbolic.
victims, the benefits can include enabling a victim to leave an abusive
relationship by providing immediate financial assistance
to relocate. The
process itself may also validate a victim’s experiences. This can be
particularly important for victims of
family violence, given such violence is
often associated with low prosecution and conviction
1.7 However
as recognised by the Royal Commission, victims of family
violence face significant barriers in accessing state-funded financial
under the Act.
1.8 These barriers are not unique to Victoria. Previous reviews have also
found that other state and territory schemes may not adequately
recognise the
nature and dynamics
of family violence, potentially discriminating unfairly against victims of
family violence as compared to other victims of crime.
Academic literature has also observed similar barriers:
one of the greatest impediments to women’s access to victim
compensation is the legislative requirements of the schemes
themselves...[V]ictim
compensation schemes, like the criminal law, are largely
premised on a ‘stranger violence model’. The schemes assume
victim does not know the assailant, that the violence is a random act and that
the victim is not dependent on the assailant.
1.9 While state-funded financial assistance is accepted as a core component
of responding to the harms of family violence, it is not
established that such
assistance is being realised for victims of family violence. Therefore, this
reference considers what changes
should be made to the Act to assist family
violence victims to rebuild their lives and recover.
‘Compensation’
and ‘state-funded financial assistance’ are terms used in different
to payments made by the state to victims of crime. Refer
to [1.19] for discussion of terminology used in this report, including
‘state-funded
financial assistance’
‘compensation’. See also, for example, Isobelle

Scope of the reference
1.10 The terms of reference ask the Commission to review and report on the
operation of the Act as it applies to victims of family
violence. Specifically,
the Commission has been asked to consider the following matters raised by
Recommendation 106 of the Royal
Commission:
• the eligibility test under the Act
• the categories and quantum (amount) of awards
• requirements to notify a perpetrator about a Victims of Crime
Assistance Tribunal
(VOCAT) application
• the matters giving rise to refusal of an application
• procedural matters to expedite (speed up) the making of an award.
1.11 Accordingly, the terms of reference require the Commission to consider
how the purpose and objectives of the Act are realised
for family violence
victims. That is, to what extent the Act:
assists family
violence victims to recover from crime by paying financial assistance for
expenses incurred or likely to be incurred
as a direct result of the
pays family
violence victims financial assistance (including special financial assistance)
as a symbolic expression by the state of
the community’s sympathy and
condolence for, and recognition of, significant adverse effects experienced or
suffered by them
as victims of crime
allows family
violence victims to have recourse to financial assistance where compensation for
the injury cannot be obtained from
the offender or other
1.12 The Act’s purpose and
objectives also state that:
financial assistance (including special financial assistance) are not intended
to reflect the level of compensation to which
victims of crime may be entitled
at common law or otherwise
the scheme is
intended to complement other services provided by government to victims of
1.13 By examining how the
Act’s purpose and objectives are realised for family violence victims, the
terms of reference require
the Commission to consider whether the Act unfairly
limits access to financial assistance for victims of family violence as compared
to other victims of crime.
The terms of reference
also require the Commission to examine what changes should be made to the Act to
rebuild their lives and recover.
1.14 Given the defined scope of the reference, it is not intended to
re-examine broader
matters relating to the family violence service system.
These issues have been extensively covered by the Royal Commission, which
undertook over 800 community consultations, held 25 days
of public hearings and
assessed almost 1000 written submissions.
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
reviews have found that a number of provisions in victims’ compensation
legislation may not adequately recognise the
nature and dynamics of family
violence and may potentially discriminate unfairly against victims of family
violence as compared
to other victims of crime. See, eg, Australian Law Reform
Commission and New South Wales Law Reform Commission,

family violence service system includes specialist family violence services,
police, courts and legal services, victim support,
child and family services,
health services and housing and homelessness services. Refer to discussion in
Chapter 4, which summarises
some of the
core components of the
family violence service system.

Ending Family Violence: Victoria’s Plan for Change
1.15 The breadth and depth of the Royal Commission’s examination of
current programs,
laws and policies provide a solid foundation for this reference to focus
specifically on the provision of state-funded financial assistance
to victims of
family violence under the Act.
1.16 This reference will not re-examine broader matters regarding victims of
crime, compensation or victim assistance programs. These
issues have recently
been considered by the Victorian Law Reform Commission’s report
Role of Victims of Crime in the Criminal Trial Process
, which, amongst
other things, considered improvements to the victim support system more
1.17 However, this consultation paper will refer to the findings and
recommendations of the Royal Commission and the Victorian Law
Commission’s victims of crime reference to the extent they provide context
for, and raise matters directly relevant
to, this reference.
1.18 Consistent with the terms of reference, this reference will not review
the total financial assistance currently available under
the Act. This issue is
outside the scope of this reference.
Terminology
1.19 This part explains why the Commission has used particular terminology in
this consultation paper, noting there is not universal
agreement about the use
of particular terms.
Victims of family violence
1.20 The terms of reference use the words ‘victims of family
violence’ to describe people affected by family violence.
This reference
retains the use of ‘victims of family violence’ to ensure
consistency with both the terms of reference
and the legislative framework in
Victoria providing for victim support and rights.
1.21 The terms of reference do not define either ‘victim’ or
‘family violence’. It is beyond
the scope of this reference to consider or review definitions of either
‘victim’ or ‘family violence’. Therefore,
the Commission
uses the term ‘family violence’ as defined in the
Family Violence
Protection Act 2008
‘family violence’ means any behaviour that:
• is physically, sexually, emotionally, psychologically or economically
is threatening,
coercive, controlling, dominating and causes a family member to fear for the
safety or wellbeing of themselves or
another family member
causes a child
to hear, witness or otherwise be exposed to the effects of the above
behaviours.
1.22 For the purposes of this
reference, a ‘victim of family violence’ is therefore any person
who has been the victim of any of the above behaviours, whether or not there
has been a criminal prosecution or conviction in relation
Not all behaviours captured by the definition
of ‘family violence’ constitute criminal offences. The Royal

Trial Process,
Report No 34 (2016) xvii and Victorian Law Reform Commission,
The Role of Victims of Crime in the Criminal Trial Process,
Consultation
Paper (2016) 166 –74. The Victorian Government has also recently
indicated it will seek advice from the Sentencing
Advisory Council about ways to
improve court orders for compensation for victims of crime, see Office of the
Premier (Vic), ‘Supporting
Victims of Crime in the Justice System’
(Media Release,
7 May 2017) 1.

acknowledging concerns about the term ‘victim’, maintaining this
terminology ensures consistency with the terms
of reference and victim-related
legislation in Victoria, including the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
Victims’ Charter Act 2006
(Vic). The Commission notes
the government’s use of ‘victim survivors’ and discussion of
terminology in Department
of Premier and Cabinet (Vic),
Ending Family
Violence: Victoria’s Plan for Change
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
terms such as ‘domestic violence’ and ‘intimate partner
violence’ used in other reports and literature
will be accepted as
encompassing the range of behaviours outlined in the
Family Violence
Protection Act 2008
for example, The Lookout,
7—Family Violence Statistics
also used the definition of family violence from the
Family Violence
Protection Act 2008
Perpetrators of violence
1.23 The terms of reference use the term ‘perpetrator’ to
describe someone who uses family violence.
1.24 For the purposes of this reference, ‘perpetrator’ means any
person who is alleged to have used family violence, whether
behaviours have been reported to police or whether or not there has been a
criminal prosecution or conviction. This approach
is consistent with the terminology used in the terms of reference and the
legislative framework under the
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
1.25 The Commission notes that the term ‘perpetrator’ is not used
in the Act but is used, although not defined, in the
Family Violence
Protection Act 2008
‘Financial assistance’ and ‘compensation’
1.26 Some reports and literature refer to state-funded financial assistance
as ‘victim compensation’ or ‘victim
compensation
1.27 Victoria’s legislative framework expressly provides that the Act
does not establish a
‘compensation scheme’ and that any awards are not intended to
reflect the level of compensation that may be available
through other avenues.
However, other jurisdictions and academic literature sometimes use the term
‘compensation’ to
refer to state-
funded financial assistance schemes similar to what is provided for under
the Act. Where discussing or referring to that literature,
the Commission may
adopt consistent terminology for comparative purposes only.
1.28 For the purposes of this reference, the term ‘financial
assistance’ refers to the provision of state-funded
financial assistance
under the Act. Where other forms of financial assistance are referred to, the
consultation paper expressly notes
difference.
Preliminary meetings
1.29 As part of its preliminary research, the Commission conducted meetings
with representatives of key stakeholders from the courts
and judiciary,
government departments, family violence advocacy or service provision, legal
services and victim support.
1.30 The purpose of these preliminary meetings was to enable the Commission
to gain a better understanding of the key issues, including
impacts on victims
of family violence, and proposals for reform raised in submissions to the Royal
Commission, to assist with identifying
proposals and options for reform for this
consultation paper.
1.31 Preliminary meetings do not form part of the Commission’s
formal consultations for this reference. Formal consultations
will be conducted
in conjunction with the publication of this consultation paper, along with a
call for public submissions.
Consultation paper
1.32 The findings of the Royal Commission, including submissions made to it,
the Commission’s preliminary consultations, and
other research form the
basis of this consultation paper.
25 Victoria, Royal Commission into Family Violence,
Summary and
Recommendations
‘Perpetrator’
is intended to include people who use family violence; offenders (people who
have been criminally prosecuted
for crimes related to family violence); alleged
offenders (people who are alleged to have committed crimes relating to family
as well as respondents in family violence intervention order
matters, whether or not criminal matters have proceeded.

Isobelle Barrett Meyering,
Victim Compensation and Domestic Violence: A
National Overview

Domestic and Family Violence Clearinghouse, 2010) 2.
28 For example, family violence flexible support packages are also
state-funded financial assistance; these are discussed in Chapter
comparison to the financial assistance available
under the Act.
1.33 The structure of this consultation paper is based on its terms of
reference and the issues identified by the Royal Commission
and during the
preliminary consultations.
1.34 Part One of this consultation paper provides background information
of the reference and our approach. It also provides an overview of family
violence in our community and recent policy and reform activities.
1.35 Part One also introduces the family violence and victim assistance
system. It provides an overview of state-funded financial
assistance for victims
of family violence under the Act and refers to similar schemes across other
states and territories and internationally.
1.36 Part Two of this consultation paper examines the key issues relevant to
this reference.
These issues include eligibility, the category and quantum (amount) of
awards, the form and timing of applications, VOCAT notification
provisions,
factors relevant in the determination of awards, timeliness of awards and
review, variation and refunding of awards as
they impact on victims of family
1.37 Part Two of this consultation paper also discusses possible options for
reform and asks specific questions to guide the public
and stakeholders in
preparing submissions during the consultation phase.
1.38 Part Three of this consultation paper provides broader contextual
analysis of the Act and associated issues including community
awareness and
accessibility of the scheme as it relates to family violence victims. Part Three
also examines aspects of the Act and
VOCAT that extend beyond the provision of
financial assistance. This includes consideration of VOCAT’s potential
therapeutic forum for acknowledging victims of crime.
1.39 Finally, Part Three summarises some of the key issues raised for the
purposes of examining whether the purpose and objectives
of the Act are realised
for victims of family violence.
1.40 This consultation paper does not represent any final conclusions or
views on the matters raised.
Formal consultation process
1.41 The next stage of the reference will involve consulting with key
stakeholders, interested organisations and individuals to further
examine the
issues raised in this consultation paper, seeking views on the questions posed,
and to develop and test options for reform
of the Act.
1.42 The Commission intends to consult with the judiciary, victim support and
advocacy organisations (government and non-government),
family violence support
and advocacy organisations, government departments, legal services and key
1.43 In particular, the Commission seeks the views of individuals with direct
experience of VOCAT processes, victim and family violence
support workers who
assist family violence victims to access VOCAT, and members of the legal
profession whose work interacts with
VOCAT. The Commission also welcomes
submissions from members of the broader community.
1.44 The feedback and information the Commission receives from submissions
and formal consultation, combined with additional research,
will inform its
recommendations to the Attorney-General.
1.45 A report setting out the Commission’s recommendations will be
provided to the Attorney- General by the reporting date of
31 January 2018.
Within 14 sitting days of receipt
of the report, the Attorney-General must table the report in the Victorian
Parliament. The Victorian Government will decide whether
to implement the
Commission’s recommendations. Legislative change will be decided by the
Victorian Parliament.

2. The Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
2.1 Before turning to a consideration of the issue of family violence under
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act), this chapter
provides an introduction to the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
2.2 VOCAT is the key body to which the terms of reference relate, as it
determines all applications for financial assistance made
under the Act.
2.3 This chapter gives an overview of the structure, procedure and processes
of VOCAT, as well as the demand for its services.
The structure of VOCAT
2.4 VOCAT is established by the Act to hear and determine applications for
financial assistance made by victims of crime.
2.5 VOCAT consists of tribunal members, who are magistrates. It comprises the
Magistrate and all magistrates and reserve magistrates under the
Magistrates’ Court Act
Each VOCAT hearing is
constituted by a single tribunal member.
2.6 Although located within the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria, VOCAT
is a separate entity with its own jurisdiction. A diagram
showing how VOCAT fits
with the other jurisdictions of the Magistrates’ Court is set out at
Appendix A.
2.7 In addition, the Chief Magistrate has delegated tribunal powers to 10
judicial registrars
to determine certain types of application, including interim awards of
financial assistance.
In 2015–16, judicial registrars determined almost 22 per cent of final
2.8 The Chief Magistrate appoints supervising magistrates to support the
operation of VOCAT. Supervising magistrates encourage best
practice across VOCAT
and represent VOCAT in its dealings with other members of the judiciary, staff
and community.
2.9 VOCAT operates in all 51 Magistrates’ Court venues across
Specialisation within the VOCAT structure
2.10 In 2006, VOCAT established a specialist Koori List which is now a
permanent part of VOCAT operations. The list was created to
ensure that the
purposes and objectives of the Act could be achieved for Koori
applicants.

8 Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal,
VOCAT List Pilot: Review and Recommendations
2.11 The Koori List does not apply any different legal considerations. All
determinations are made within the framework of the Act.
However, the list
enables VOCAT to be more responsive to the circumstances of Koori victims of
2.12 VOCAT has stated that key to the success of the Koori List is the
procedural flexibility and informality available under the
Act which enable the
Tribunal to respond flexibly to applicants’
circumstances.
This may involve sitting at a table
to hear participants, rather than at the bench, adopting a more informal
approach and receiving
culturally specific information from community
representatives.
2.13 Furthermore, while VOCAT itself does not have a specialist family
violence list, magistrates who sit in the Family Violence Court
Division are
able to hear and determine VOCAT applications in conjunction with other civil or
criminal family violence matters.
In dealing with a
VOCAT application, the Family Violence Court Division has the same functions,
powers and duties as VOCAT.
2.14 The Family Violence Court Division is a separate division of the
Magistrates’ Court of
The Family Violence Court Division is
discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
The procedure and process of VOCAT
2.15 VOCAT is not a court. VOCAT hearings are less formal than court
and VOCAT is not bound by the rules of
2.16 VOCAT’s procedure, however, remains a legal process, which is
bound by the provisions of the Act.
2.17 In deciding applications for financial assistance made by victims of
crime, VOCAT has a duty to act fairly, expeditiously (promptly)
and according to
the merits of the case.
2.18 In addition, VOCAT must give a party to the matter a reasonable
opportunity to
call or give evidence, examine, cross-examine or re-examine witnesses and to
make submissions.
2.19 VOCAT has the power to issue a warrant for arrest against a witness who
has been served with a summons to attend a VOCAT hearing
and who has failed to
2.20 VOCAT also has broad investigative powers to make any enquiry and order
any document or report that it requires.

Introduction
3.1 This chapter defines family violence and describes its dynamics and
characteristics.
3.2 This chapter also provides an overview of the current policy and reform
context to clarify how this reference complements and
intersects with other
reform activities.
Dynamics and characteristics of family violence
3.3 Family violence includes a broad range of behaviours, not limited to acts
of physical or sexual violence. Family violence also
encompasses psychological,
emotional, cultural, spiritual and financial abuse.
As discussed in Chapter 6, family violence may not always constitute a
criminal offence, and so may not be an ‘act of violence’
meaning of the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act).
3.4 Family violence has distinct characteristics and dynamics. Perpetrators
of family violence are motivated by a desire for coercion,
control and
domination which can take the
form of restricting access to money, communication devices and transport, or
limiting a person’s contact with friends and family
with the aim of
isolating or, in some cases, imprisoning victims in their
Perpetrators of family violence exercise power
and control over another person with the intent to intimidate, humiliate,
or isolate a victim.
3.5 Family violence is rarely experienced as a ‘one-off’ event.
Victims often experience family violence over a long
period of time. Family
violence manifests as a pattern of behaviour involving an escalating spiral of
violence. Family violence is
also characterised by periods of increased risk
such as during pregnancy, separation or attempted
separation.
3.6 The cumulative harm of family violence has a severe impact on
victims’ health and wellbeing, and makes social and economic
disadvantage
even worse, limiting a victim’s ability to escape violence or seek help
and support.
3.7 It is widely accepted that family violence is a gendered crime:
While both men and women can be perpetrators or victims of family violence,
overwhelmingly the majority of victims are women and children,
and the majority
of perpetrators are men.

3.8 The Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence (the Royal
Commission) found that the most common manifestation of family
violence is
intimate partner violence committed by men against their current or former
female partners.
Prevalence and community impacts
Prevalence and reported incidents of family violence
3.9 The Royal Commission comprehensively examined the prevalence of family
violence and determined that overall, it is difficult to
definitively determine
what proportion of the population has experienced family violence—that is,
of family violence.
This is because family violence still remains hidden. Many victims may not
report incidents of family violence or identify as victims.
Victims may seek
information or support but not report a matter to police. There may also be poor
or inconsistent information collection
by agencies supporting
3.10 However, the Royal Commission found that Victoria has experienced a
significant increase in reported incidents of family
Victoria’s Crime Statistics Agency
has reported that in 2016 there were 78,628 family violence
Although these incidents fall within the
definition of family violence under the
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
(Vic), they may not necessarily constitute criminal offences.
3.11 The number of finalised family violence intervention order applications
in the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria nearly doubled
between 2000–01
and 2013–14, from 16,889 to 35,135 finalised
applications.
In addition, criminal charges for
contraventions of a family violence intervention order have more than tripled
since 2004–05.
In 2015–16, family
violence concerns were indicated in almost 50 per cent of reports to child
protection.
3.12 Research indicates that family violence affects a significant proportion
of Australia’s population,
and that it is
prevalent across all cultures, ages and socio-economic
However, there are greater barriers to detection of, and responses to, family
violence for some specific groups.
These include
Aboriginal people, people with a disability, people from diverse cultural,
linguistic and faith backgrounds, members
of the LGBTIQ community, older people,
people who work in the sex industry, people in prison or exiting prison and
people who live
in regional, rural and remote areas.
3.13 Despite increased detection and reporting, and the associated increase
in proactive interventions by police and courts, family
violence still remains
hidden, under-reported
and often undetected in our community. KPMG’s 2017 report
of Family Violence in Victoria
found that a high proportion of family
violence is not reported to police.
KPMG estimated that in 2015–16, over 160,000 people experienced family
violence in Victoria, more than double the 78,628 family
violence incidents
reported by Victoria’s Crime Statistics Agency in

Effects on children and young people
3.14 Given the broader family violence data issues outlined above,
ascertaining the extent to which children and young people are
experiencing
family violence is difficult. The Royal Commission concluded that the
under-reporting of family violence made it difficult
to determine the prevalence
of family violence for children and young people, as with the general
population. However, the Royal
Commission also acknowledged that many homes in
which family violence occurs will be homes in which children and young people
3.15 In this context, Victoria Police data analysed by the Royal Commission
indicated children were present in around 35 per cent
of family violence
incidents. However, this figure is likely to represent only a portion of all
actual family violence incidents
against children
and young people because of low family violence reporting
The Royal Commission described children and
young people as ‘silent victims’ because not only is there a lack of
the family violence system has historically focused on the safety and
wellbeing of women.
3.16 The devastating effects of family violence on children and young people
are now well established. These effects can be linked
whose mother may be experiencing elevated levels of stress as a result of family
violence, of which hormonal
effects can be transferred to the
Infants have been found to be highly
sensitive to prolonged periods of stress, and young children can suffer a range
of physical,
emotional and mental health effects arising from family violence
occurring in the home.
Significantly, these effects occur irrespective of how a child or young
person experiences family violence. As the Royal Commission
found, the effects
of hearing, witnessing or otherwise being exposed to violence are similar to the
effects of experiencing direct
physical violence.
3.17 Aside from the physical, emotional and mental health effects, the Royal
Commission also highlighted the connection between experiencing
family violence
as a child and later criminal offending behaviour. The intergenerational effects
mean victims of family violence
can also later become perpetrators of family
violence themselves.
3.18 Despite strong evidence confirming the physiological, psychological and
emotional impacts of family violence, the Royal Commission
found this knowledge
has not been adequately translated into appropriate responses by the service
system, including the legal system.
The Royal Commission found that children and
young people are not ‘passive’ witnesses or ‘secondary
and that they should be recognised as ‘victims in their
own right’.
Impacts for victims of family violence in rural and regional
communities
3.19 Although many issues faced by victims of family violence in metropolitan
and regional areas may be similar, research suggests
that living in a regional
community can compound family violence
victimisation.
3.20 Accordingly, access to justice and support for victims of family
violence in rural and regional communities was examined by the
Royal Commission.
The Royal Commission defined communities outside of Greater Melbourne as
‘regional’, based on the Australian
Bureau of Statistics’
Estimated Resident Population statistics.

3.21 The Estimated Resident Population statistics show that as at 30 June
2016, 4,641,636 of
Victoria’s population resided in Greater Melbourne and 1,428,000 (that
is, approximately
24 per cent) resided in regional Victoria.
3.22 The Royal Commission found that family violence victims living in
regional communities are affected by a number of specific issues,
• geographic and social isolation
• privacy implications of reporting violence or seeking help in a small
• cultural norms in small communities
• access to firearms and other weapons

3.23 Similarly, research by
Deakin University in 2013 found that ‘there are a range of issues unique
to women living in rural
and regional locations that compound barriers to safety
including limited availability of services and geographic
isolation’.
3.24 Of particular relevance to this reference, the Royal Commission found a
lack of family violence court specialisation in regional
areas compared to
metropolitan locations, leading to differences in court experiences for victims
of family violence.
The Royal Commission also found
barriers to accessing legal services in regional areas, including barriers to
accessing lawyers from

violence in rural, regional and remote communities face
particular challenges.
These include geographical and social isolation, greater economic vulnerability,
cultural factors and a lack

3.27 In light of the issues identified above, the Royal Commission found that
regional communities pose specific challenges for government
and the community
in responding to family violence.
Costs of family violence to the community
3.28 Family violence has significant social, economic and community impacts.
These impacts are felt beyond the individuals and families
directly affected by
violence. They manifest in an increased burden on government and community
services, as well as the broader
economy. For example, family violence is the
single largest cause of homelessness for women.
Intimate partner violence contributes to more death, disability and
illness in women aged 18–44 than any other preventable risk

relevant to this reference.
3.32 These reviews and reforms provide a broader context for consideration of
current issues in relation to family violence victims’
experience of the

reference is a small part of broader
system changes and reforms being
implemented in Victoria in relation to family violence.
3.33 For example, in response to Recommendation 37 of the Royal Commission,
the Victorian Government has committed to developing a
network of support and
safety hubs.
Once these hubs are established, victims
will be able to visit a single venue to access information and support, rather
than having
to seek these via multiple avenues.
3.34 These reforms are intended to improve linkages between victims, victim
and family violence support services and the justice system,
Five support and safety hubs are to be set

Summary and
Recommendations
3.37 The Royal Commission comprehensively assessed all components of the
government’s and community’s response to family
violence. On 29
March 2016, the Royal Commission handed down its final report.
3.38 The Royal Commission concluded that despite a sustained effort to
address family
violence in the community through structural and procedural reform, serious
limitations to the existing approach remained.
3.39 In making 227 recommendations, the Royal Commission has proposed an
agenda for change across Victoria’s health, justice
and social service
The recommendations aim to improve outcomes
for victims of family violence, improve perpetrator accountability and bring
in community attitudes towards family violence.
3.40 The Royal Commission recommendations encompass significant reforms
• risk assessment and management, pathways to services and information
• specialist family violence services and creating a safe home
responses to
children and young people’s experience of family violence (including the
child protection system) as well as to
adolescents who use family
• sexual assault and family violence responses
• police operations and leadership
• court responses, offences and sentencing, restorative justice and
• prevention and perpetrator interventions
• health and wellbeing approaches, including in the workplace
• family violence and diversity, vulnerable cohorts and impacts on
specific communities
• governance arrangements, industry planning and investment in data and
(including ongoing review of family violence
3.41 This reference directly relates to matters raised by Recommendation 106
of the Royal
Commission, which recommends that:
The Victorian Law Reform Commission consider the matters the Commission
raised in this report in relation to the Victims of Crime
Assistance Tribunal
and the Victim Assistance Program in its Victims of Crime in the Criminal Trial
Process review. To the extent
that these matters do not fall within the terms
of reference for that review, the Attorney-General should amend the terms of
or ensure that a separate review of these matters is carried
3.42 Recommendation 106 formed part of the Royal Commission’s findings
of family violence. These
findings emphasised that the cumulative effects of family violence can be made
worse by difficulties victims
have in navigating the justice and service system,
including attempting to gain social and financial
independence.
3.43 The Royal Commission’s findings about access to VOCAT for victims
of family violence are not specifically set out in Recommendation
106. Instead,
the recommendation refers to
‘matters raised’.

Other relevant reviews
Victorian Law Reform Commission—The Role of Victims of Crime in the
Criminal Trial
3.50 In October 2014, the Victorian Law Reform Commission (the Commission)
was asked to review the role of victims of crime in the
criminal trial process.
As part of this review, and of direct relevance to this reference, the
Commission was asked to consider the
making of compensation, restitution or
other orders for the benefit of victims against offenders as part of, or in
conjunction with,
the criminal trial process.
3.51 In August 2016, the Commission delivered its report,
The Role of
Victims of Crime in the Criminal Trial Process
. The Commission made
recommendations aimed at improving the legislative framework and practical
operation of restitution and compensation
orders against
However, the Commission also acknowledged
that for some victims of crime, state-funded financial assistance through VOCAT
the only means of obtaining financial
reparation.
3.52 The Commission also identified some preliminary concerns with access to
VOCAT for victims of family violence. In a roundtable
with magistrates, the
Commission was told that the Act does not accommodate the particular dynamics
and characteristics of family
violence and is framed around a conception of
crime as a single violent act.
3.53 Section 52 of the Act requires VOCAT to refuse an application where an
act of violence has not been reported ‘within a
reasonable time’ or
where a victim has failed to provide
‘reasonable assistance’ to investigatory or prosecutorial bodies.
Stakeholder proposals included that section 52 be amended
to list family
violence as a factor VOCAT should be able to take into account when deciding not
to refuse an application.
3.54 Although raising the above matters, the Commission acknowledged that
further consideration of these issues was beyond its terms
of reference.
3.55 However, the Commission did make recommendations relating to restricting
and use of, VOCAT records to protect victims of crime during the VOCAT and
criminal trial process. Given victims apply for assistance
from VOCAT to help
them with their recovery, the Commission found that victims should not be
discouraged from seeking financial assistance
out of fear that an offender or
family violence perpetrator may access or use their VOCAT records in a criminal
proceeding.
57 In May 2017, the Victorian Government announced funding of $448.1 million
to establish 17 support and safety hubs and $269.4 million
to enhance the response of Victoria’s legal system to family violence,
including implementation of the specialist family violence

and territory criminal laws
the impact of

financial assistance schemes and their application for
victims of family
violence. The review found that compensating victims of crime is part of a trend
towards greater recognition of
victims of crime and affirmed that such schemes
are an important element of victim support.
3.59 The review recommended changes to victims’ compensation
legislation to ensure victims of family violence are not disadvantaged.
particular, they recommended that applicable state and territory legislation be
amended to:
• expand the definition of ‘act of violence’ or
‘injury’ to include ‘family violence’
ensure acts are
not treated as ‘related acts’ merely because they are committed by
the same person (and legislation should
allow a victim to object if claims are
to be treated as ‘related’)
compensation is not denied on the basis that it would advantage or benefit an
offender, specifically as these provisions discriminate
against victims of
family violence.
3.60 These issues
largely remain unresolved in Victoria and were raised again by the Royal
Commission. The Victorian Law Reform Commission
considers these issues in detail

Introduction
4.1 The Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence (the Royal
Commission)
acknowledged that for victims of family violence there is no single pathway
‘family violence system’.
Instead, the
system is made up of a number of distinct but often overlapping
4.2 Broadly, the family violence ‘system’ comprises:
• specialist family violence (including specialist women’s and
children’s) services
• courts and legal services
• victim support services (including specialist sexual assault
• child protection and family services
• housing and homelessness services
• health services (including mental health, drug and alcohol
4.3 Support can be accessed via multiple ‘doors’ and at
different points or stages. Victims may have only one touch
point in the system
or may access different components of it
simultaneously.
4.4 This chapter provides a brief overview of the key aspects of this system
that are relevant to this reference: specialist family
violence services, the
police, the courts, legal services and victim support services. These parts of
the system intersect either
directly or indirectly with state-funded financial
assistance under the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act).
Specialist family violence services
4.5 Specialist family violence services are predominantly community-based
services whose
core business is working with women and children.
There are 28 specialist family violence support services in

Royal Commission further acknowledged that the elements of the family violence
system at times remain ‘siloed’ and
fragmented, leading to increased
complexity for victims attempting to access support:

Magistrates’ Court while seeking legal advice
for family law proceedings,

4.6 Specialist family violence services are generally government-funded and
• emergency assistance (for example, following a referral from police),
including via a
24-hour telephone service
• case management or specialist support/outreach
• accommodation assistance
• counselling.
4.7 Specialist family violence services administer the government’s
family violence flexible support packages which assist victims
violence by helping them meet expenses such as rental or relocation costs,
clothing and books for children or security
measures to improve safety at
4.8 The Victorian Law Reform Commission (the Commission) heard during
preliminary consultations that some specialist family violence
services advise
victims of family violence about the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
(VOCAT), and in some circumstances, may
assist them to prepare an application or
access legal assistance to do so. However, the Commission was also told that
VOCAT is not
usually a core part of their service as women and children often
require urgent case management, housing, financial or counselling
assistance,
and that the VOCAT process can take time and can be complicated for non- legal
services to assist with. This means VOCAT
is often not pursued immediately,
limiting its ability to assist family violence victims during this
‘crisis’ stage.
4.9 Victoria Police is often the first point of contact for victims of family
violence. The
Police Code of Practice for the Investigation of Family Violence
Code of Practice) and the
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
together provide the legislative and procedural framework for police responses
to both victims and perpetrators.
4.10 Victoria Police has established specific roles and organisational
structures to support an enhanced response to family violence.
This includes the
appointment of family violence liaison officers and family violence advisers,
and the establishment of family violence
teams and a Family Violence
Coordination Unit.
In 2015, Victoria Police
established Australia’s first Family Violence Command to assist Victoria
Police to develop a more effective
response to family
The command acts as a central point of
accountability for family violence within Victoria
4.11 As outlined further below, police have a number of options to respond to
victims and perpetrators, including pursuing civil avenues
on behalf of victims
to protect their safety, as well as criminal options to address perpetrator
offending. In addition, police
may facilitate referrals to other services within
the family violence or broader service system.
4.12 Victoria Police’s website states that all victims of family
violence have the right to access specialist family violence
support services
and that police will offer direct referrals to these services. VOCAT is listed

Civil responses
4.13 Civil responses available to police include issuing a family violence
safety notice or applying for a family violence intervention
order under the
Family Violence Protection Act
4.14 Family violence safety notices are now the most common civil action
taken by police.
Family violence safety notices enable police to place immediate restrictions
on a perpetrator when attending a family violence incident
outside of court
Family violence safety notices provide
immediate protection for an affected family member because a police officer can
the notice protections similar to those in an intervention order,
such as excluding a respondent from the family home. Family violence
notices can be made without the consent of the victim.
A family violence safety notice also operates as an application for a
family violence intervention order and as a summons for the
respondent to attend
Police may also apply on victims’ behalf
for a family violence intervention order.
Criminal responses
4.15 Under the Code of Practice, police are required to pursue criminal
charges where there is evidence of a criminal offence, regardless

As such, the Magistrates’ Court has
established specialist family violence responses, most notably the Family

include dedicated family violence

well as specially trained court staff and

4.22 Given the volume of family violence-related work across
Magistrates’ Court locations, and the limited court locations of
Family Violence Court Division and Specialist Family Violence Service, the
majority of family violence matters continue
to be dealt with in the mainstream
Magistrates’ Courts.
However, as noted above,
the Victorian Government has recently announced the expansion of specialist
family violence courts.
4.23 Of particular relevance to this reference is VOCAT. As discussed in
Chapter 2, VOCAT is a separate jurisdiction and is constituted
by magistrates of
the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria. VOCAT operates in all 51
Magistrates’ Court venues across Victoria.
4.24 Specialist approaches to family violence in other Victorian courts is
limited. The County Court has identified concerns that
it does not have family
violence risk assessment or case management processes.
There are no specialist approaches to family violence in the Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court’s submission to the Royal Commission
that although the matters coming before the Trial Division of its criminal court
are the most serious in nature, the numbers
are small and predominantly concern
Legal services
4.25 Victims of family violence access legal services to assist with a range
of separate, yet often interrelated, matters resulting
from family violence.
This might include intervention order proceedings, criminal law matters, family
law proceedings and VOCAT applications.
4.26 Victoria Legal Aid and community legal centres provide a range of
support and assistance to both victims and perpetrators of
family violence,
including legal assistance in family violence intervention order matters and
criminal charges relating to family
violence, such as breaches of family
violence intervention orders or other criminal acts.
4.27 Specialist legal services also provide enhanced support and assistance
for particular groups. Women’s Legal Service Victoria
provides support
only to female clients and the Aboriginal Family Violence Prevention and Legal
Service provides support predominantly

victims of crime to receive assistance and compensation.
In 1985, the United

This Declaration provides that ‘victims should receive the

territories closely mirror provisions in Victoria. Most schemes
aim to promote
victim recovery and some expressly provide for acknowledgment and recognition by
the state and the community of the
harm caused by an act of violence. Most
require a person to have suffered injury as a
result of an act of violence, with some jurisdictions specifically
recognising family violence.

government-appointed commissioners or assessors.
Furthermore, some schemes
explicitly define or provide for family or domestic

and restitution options available to victims of crime in
Victoria and sets out
the relevant legislative framework in Victoria under the Act.
Options available in Victoria

• seek compensation or restitution under the

• pursue a civil action against an offender for an award of damages
• apply for state-funded financial assistance under the

Consultation Paper (2016) 131.
5.15 Consideration of broader compensation or restitution schemes available
to victims is beyond the Victorian Law Reform Commission’s
Commission) terms of reference. However, the options for victims in Victoria are
summarised below to provide context for the
operation of VOCAT, and to
understand why VOCAT might be the only option for financial assistance or
redress for some victims of
family violence.
Compensation and restitution orders under the
Sentencing Act
5.16 Restitution and compensation orders can be made under
Sentencing Act
Orders are made as part of the sentencing process and can be made for loss or
injury caused as a direct result of the offence where
an offender has pleaded
guilty or been found guilty.
5.17 Restitution orders relate specifically to restoration of stolen goods
connected to theft.
A compensation order can be made against the offender for the value of any
loss or damage as a result of an offence. Compensation
orders can also be made
for any injury directly caused, as well as for pain and suffering and some
expenses incurred (or likely to
be incurred).
5.18 As family violence offences are still significantly
under-reported,
access to restitution and
compensation under the
Sentencing Act
may not be relevant for many family
violence victims. In addition, such orders rely on the offender’s ability
to pay and the
successful enforcement of such orders. Given the often complex
and interconnected financial relationship between family violence
victims and
perpetrators, such orders may further disadvantage a victim of family violence
financially. Victims may also be too fearful
to pursue these orders, given their
relationship with the perpetrator.
Civil action for award of damages
5.19 Victims of crime can sue the offender for damages in a civil action.
Civil action can be a significant financial and procedural
burden for victims of
crime, and the
Sentencing Act
’s provisions were intended to be a faster
and cheaper alternative to pursuing civil
proceedings.
5.20 As with compensation and restitution orders under the
Sentencing Act
civil action may
be impractical for victims of family violence. Unlike other victims of crime,
victims of family violence have, or have had, a relationship
with their offender
and may have financial ties
to the perpetrator of violence. Pursuing a civil action requires hiring a
lawyer, potentially at high cost, and is likely to be impractical
undesirable for many victims of family violence.
State-funded financial assistance under the
Victims of Crime Assistance
Victims of Crime Assistance Act
gives victims of violent crime an
avenue for state- funded financial assistance to aid their recovery in
circumstances where they
cannot obtain financial assistance from other
5.22 Awards of financial assistance are for expenses incurred, or likely to
be incurred.
In some circumstances, lump sum payments
can be awarded as a symbolic expression of the community’s sympathy and
recognition
of the effects of crime.

5.23 For the reasons outlined above, state-funded financial assistance
under the Act is often the only option available to victims
The Act is described in the next
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
Policy intent
5.24 When the Act was introduced, the Second Reading Speech articulated a
broad intent to develop a model more responsive to the needs
of victims in order
to ‘... maximise the potential for a victim’s recovery from the
psychological and physical effects
of a violent
5.25 The then-Attorney-General, the Hon. Jan Wade MP, described the Act as
establishing an integrated model of assistance for victims
5.26 She stated the Act would address the needs of victims of violent crimes
and achieve an appropriate balance between the interests
of victims, the state
and the rights of offenders. Furthermore, the Act would:
address the
physical and psychological needs of a victim of crime by ensuring that
appropriate services were available to help the
victim make a speedy
practicable, ensure that convicted offenders made good the harm caused by their
crimes by paying compensation for pain and
suffering to the victim
ensure that
procedures within the criminal justice system provided a quick and economical
means for the redress of harm suffered as
a result of the offender’s
criminal conduct
• ensure that services provided by the state
to victims of crime were affordable.
5.27 However, the Act removed the provision of state-funded compensation for
‘pain and suffering’ for victims, which had
been available under
Victoria’s preceding criminal injuries compensation laws. To address this
omission, the
Victims of Crime Assistance
(Amendment) Act 2000
(Vic) introduced awards of special financial
assistance for primary victims ‘who suffer significant adverse effects as
result of an act of violence’,
although this amending legislation did not reinstate compensation for
pain and suffering. These provisions are discussed in more detail
below and in
Part Two of this paper.
Overview of the Act
5.28 Part One of the Act sets out the Act’s purpose and objectives and
defines key terminology.
5.29 Part Two of the Act sets out eligibility for assistance.
5.30 Part Three of the Act establishes VOCAT, details the form and timing for
applications, sets out the procedures and powers of
the Tribunal and outlines
the procedures for the making of awards.
5.31 Part Four of the Act sets out procedures for review, variation and
refund of awards and
Part Five contains miscellaneous provisions.

• how awards are decided, including mandatory refusal of an award
• timeliness of awards
• review, variation and refund of awards.
6.3 Each chapter in this part outlines the relevant provisions of the Act,
considers how these provisions may affect victims of family
violence, and
discusses options for reform.
6.4 This part draws on reports and inquiries that relate to the terms of
reference, on academic literature, and on information derived
from preliminary
consultations with key stakeholders. It also uses case law to highlight how the
Act functions with respect to victims
of family violence. As very few decisions
of the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal (VOCAT) are publicly available, the
Law Reform Commission (the
Commission) mainly relies upon review decisions of the Victorian Civil and
Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT) and the Supreme Court of Victoria.
Introduction to Chapter 6
6.5 This chapter provides an overview of the eligibility criteria that an
applicant must meet in order to be granted financial assistance
under the Act.
The chapter outlines:
• the different categories of victim under which an applicant can apply
for assistance
• the requirement for there to have been an ‘act of
• the requirement for there to have been ‘injury’,
‘death’ or a ‘significant adverse effect’
• the requirement that the injury, death or significant adverse effect
is the ‘direct result’
of the act of violence
the use of the
‘balance of probabilities’ as the standard of proof to determine any
question of fact.
6.6 The first matter in the terms of reference asks the Commission to
consider ‘the eligibility test and whether this should
be expanded to
include victims of family violence where a pattern of non-criminal behaviour
results in physical or psychological
6.7 This chapter details the difficulties that victims of family violence can
experience because of the narrow definitions used in
the eligibility
6.8 Finally, the chapter sets out some options for reform, to improve access
for victims of family violence, and poses questions
for consideration.
Who is eligible?
6.9 A person is eligible for financial assistance under the Act if they are
the ‘primary’,
‘secondary’ or ‘related’ victim of a criminal act
that directly results in injury, death or a significant
adverse effect.
Primary, secondary and related victims
6.10 Under the Act there are three categories of victim who may be eligible
for assistance:
• primary victims
• secondary victims
• related victims.
6.11 Depending on the category under which a person makes an application, she
or he will be eligible for different kinds of assistance.
The categories and
quantum (amount) of financial assistance available are discussed in more detail
in Chapter 7. This chapter focuses
on eligibility.
Primary victims
6.12 Under the Act, there are two ways that a person can be a primary
Section 7(1)
states that ‘a primary victim is a person who is injured or dies as a
direct result of an act of violence committed
against him or her’. Section
8A(1) adds that a person is also a primary victim ‘if he or she
experiences or suffers a
significant adverse effect as a direct result of an act
of violence’.
Section 7(2)
provides that a person is also a primary victim if they are injured or die as a
direct result of trying to arrest a perpetrator
of an act of violence, trying to
prevent an act of violence or trying to aid or rescue a victim of an act of
6.13 To qualify as a primary victim under section 7(2),
the attempt to arrest, prevent, aid or rescue must be
This means that if a person accidentally
interrupts an act of violence, even if it ultimately prevents the offence or
assists the
victim, she or he is not a primary victim. In the case of
Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
who went to check on her mother and inadvertently interrupted an assault by her
father was found to be a secondary, rather
than primary, victim.
6.14 Section 7(2) also provides that the person intervening in an act of
violence only has to
‘believe on reasonable grounds’ that someone has committed an act
of violence, or that someone is the victim of an act
of violence, in order to be
a primary victim on this basis.
Smith v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
[2003] VCAT 1489
October 2003) [25].
Secondary victims
6.15 The Act provides that there are two ways that a person can be a
secondary victim:
Section 9(1)
states that a person is a secondary victim if they are present at the scene of
an act of violence and are injured as
a direct result of witnessing that
Section 9(2)
states that a person is a secondary victim if they are the parent or guardian of
a primary victim, who is under 18 at
the time of the event, and
are injured as a direct result of subsequently becoming aware
of the act of violence against their child.
6.16 The Act provides that a person is not a secondary victim under section
9(2) if they commit or are criminally responsible for
the act of violence
committed against the primary victim.
Related victims
6.17 A person is a ‘related victim’ under the Act if there is a
primary victim who has died as a direct result of an act
of violence and the
• a ‘close family member’ of the deceased primary
• a ‘dependent’ of the deceased primary victim
someone who has
an ‘intimate personal relationship’ with the deceased primary
6.18 The term ‘close family
member’ is defined in the Act as meaning a ‘person who had a
genuine personal relationship
with the victim at the time of the death’
and is the spouse, parent, guardian, step-parent, child (including by
guardianship),
step-child, brother, sister, step-brother or step-sister of the
This list is exhaustive and excludes other
6.19 A ‘dependent’ means an individual who was wholly or
substantially dependent on the victim’s income before the
commission of
the act of violence, or the child of a victim who would have been dependent on
the victim but who was born after their
6.20 ‘Intimate personal relationship’ is not defined in the Act.
However, the term ‘intimate personal relationship’
has been the
subject of judicial consideration. In
Reid v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT held that some or all of the
following factors could indicate the existence of an ‘intimate personal
relationship’:
• an ongoing sexual relationship
• an ongoing emotional commitment
• an ongoing provision of comfort, support and advice of a personal
• an ongoing sharing of confidences, intimacies and personal
information
• an ongoing sharing of social contacts and attendances at social

[2002] VCAT 373
(24 May 2002) [15].
10 Ibid [15].
6.21 In that case, VCAT also held that the following factors (in the absence
of other indicators)
may not constitute an ‘intimate personal relationship’:
• financial or other material support
• a sharing of residential property
• occasional contact personally or by correspondence or telephone
sharing at times of family events, including religious, ethnic or other holiday
6.22 Based on these factors,
VCAT found in
Reid v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
that a close
relationship between an aunt and a niece did not constitute an ‘intimate
personal relationship’.
6.23 In addition, in order to be a related victim or a secondary victim,
there must be a primary victim. In
McKenna v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT held that the mother
of an unborn child, who died in the womb as the result of an act of violence,
was not a related victim.
This is because the unborn
child was not a ‘person’ for the purposes of the definition of a
primary victim in the Act.
6.24 The Act also excludes related victims from applying if they commit or
are criminally responsible for the act of violence in
The need for an ‘act of violence’
6.25 To be eligible for assistance under any of the three victim categories,
the Act requires that there must have been an ‘act
of violence’.
6.26 An ‘act of violence’ is defined under the Act as a
‘criminal act’ or ‘a series of related criminal
that occurred in Victoria and that ‘directly resulted in injury or death
to one or more persons’.
6.27 The Act defines a ‘criminal act’ as an act or omission that
is a ‘relevant offence’. The following offences
are ‘relevant
offences’ under the Act:
an offence that
involves an assault, an injury or a threat of injury to a person and which is
punishable by imprisonment
sexual offences,
including rape, indecent assault, incest, sexual offences against children,
sexual offences against persons with
a cognitive impairment, and other sexual
offences (such as sexual offences involving abduction, detention and an
offensive weapon)
• the offences
of stalking, child stealing and kidnapping
• conspiracy, incitement or an attempt to commit any of the offences
listed above.
6.28 A ‘criminal act’ also includes an act or omission that would
have constituted one of the relevant offences if the
perpetrator had not been
incapable of criminal responsibility due to their age, mental impairment or the
existence of any other defence.

eligible for assistance under the
The requirement of ‘injury’ or ‘death’
6.30 The Act requires that the ‘act of violence’ must directly
result in ‘injury’ or ‘death’.
However, the requirement to establish injury or death varies depending on
the category of victim:
For primary
victims, it needs to be established that the act of violence directly resulted
in their death or injury.
victims applying under section 9(1) need to establish that they were injured as
a direct result of witnessing the act of
violence. Secondary victims applying
under section 9(2) as a parent of a primary victim need to establish two
– first, that the act of violence directly resulted
in the death or injury of their child as the primary victim, and
– second, that they personally suffered injury as a direct result of
becoming aware of the act of violence.
Related victims
need to establish that the act of violence directly caused the death of their
close relation as the primary victim
(see [6.17] – [6.24] for the types of
relationship covered by the Act).
6.31 ‘Injury’ is
defined in the Act as including:
• actual physical bodily harm
mental illness
or disorder or an exacerbation of a mental illness or disorder, whether or not
flowing from nervous shock,
• pregnancy.

include transitory pain that
lasts for a matter of minutes, it can include pain
that lasts for a period of days.
In that case, the
applicant, who had experienced pain for a number of days following an incident
of anal intercourse, was found to
have suffered ‘actual physical bodily
6.33 The term ‘mental illness or disorder’ is also not defined in
the Act. It appears to be generally understood by VCAT
to mean any mental injury
that constitutes a recognised psychiatric or psychological
6.34 However, in some cases, the presence of psychiatric symptoms without a
diagnosis of a disorder has been enough to qualify as
a ‘mental injury or
disorder’ under the Act. For example, in
AVA v Victims of Crime
Assistance Tribunal
which concerned an
application by a child in relation to her mother’s partner having taken
indecent photos of her while she
was asleep, VOCAT had found that the
applicant’s ‘shyness and anxiety problems’
did not constitute a mental injury.
however, VCAT found that the presence
of anxiety symptoms without an anxiety disorder still amounted to a mental
injury for the purposes of the Act.

6.35 In addition, the Act deems a person to be suffering an injury if
VOCAT is satisfied on medical or psychological evidence
that treatment or

assistance’ is discussed
in more detail in Chapter 7.

violence that results in a ‘significant

secondary victim still needs to establish that he or she personally suffered an

6.39 A ‘significant
adverse effect’ is defined in the Act to include ‘any grief,
distress, trauma or injury

‘significant adverse effect’ does not include any
property loss or

6.42 The ‘but for’ test is frequently used by VCAT to
establish that the act of violence directly resulted in the
This means that the test is ‘but for
the act of violence, would the victim have experienced the injury?’
6.43 However, despite using it frequently, VCAT has not held that the
‘but for’ test is the only way to establish
causation under the Act.

the judge stated:
it is unnecessary for me to decide whether satisfaction of the ‘but
for’ test is in fact a prerequisite. I add by way
of comment that the
argument in support of the ‘but for’ test seems
compelling.

established in another way. What this might be remains

Standard of proof
6.45 The standard of proof for establishing both that an act of violence
occurred and that it directly resulted in an injury is the
‘balance of
probabilities’.
This is a lower standard of
proof than the criminal standard of ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. (See
the Glossary for the meaning
of the ‘balance of probabilities’.)
6.46 In determining whether this standard has been met in applications made
under the Act, VCAT has frequently applied the test set
Briginshaw v
In that case, Mr Justice Dixon
when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual
persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it
can be found ... The
seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of
a given description, or the
gravity of the consequences flowing from a
particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the
question whether
the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the
6.47 In other words, under this test, the strength of the evidence required
to determine whether or not a fact exists on the ‘balance
probabilities’ may vary depending on the seriousness of an
allegation.
6.48 In the context of the Act, in which VOCAT must find whether or not a
‘criminal act’ occurred, the allegation will
almost always be of a
serious nature. This means that VOCAT proceedings might require a higher
standard of evidence than some other
civil matters.
6.49 However, in a number of cases, VCAT has held that while the
test is relevant, the beneficial intent of the Act should also
be taken into account when making a determination of fact with respect
application for financial assistance.
In particular,
it has pointed to the Act’s stated purpose to recognise the effect of an
act of violence on victims of crime
and to express the community’s
sympathy and condolence.
How do the current eligibility criteria affect victims of family
6.50 The eligibility criteria for making a claim for assistance under the Act
can be problematic for victims of family violence.
6.51 The narrow definitions in the Act of an ‘act of violence’
and ‘injury’ can make it difficult for victims
of family violence to
make a successful claim for assistance. Moreover, even where a victim of family
violence meets these definitions,
there can be perceived barriers to
accessibility for this group of victims.
6.52 This part discusses how the eligibility criteria can be a barrier for
victims of family violence.
Legislative barriers

respect to the eligibility criteria are:

Definition of act of violence
6.54 The Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence (the Royal
Commission) identified the definition of an ‘act of violence’
of the key barriers facing victims of family
6.55 The requirement that the victim has endured certain ‘criminal
acts’ against the person means that victims of family
violence are only
able to access the scheme if they have experienced physical violence, sexual
violence, a threat of injury, or stalking.
6.56 Accordingly, victims of non-criminal forms of family violence, such as
economic abuse, emotional and psychological abuse, intimidation,
harassment,
and context-specific harms that occur in a particular culture or tradition are
excluded from recognition under the Act.
6.57 Moreover, victims of a form of family violence that is criminal in
nature but which does not constitute an offence against the
person, are also
precluded from making a claim to VOCAT. The difficulty experienced by victims of
family violence who are subjected
to property offences, for example, is illustrated by
Purcell v Victims of
Crime Assistance Tribunal
In that case, VCAT
found that, the applicant’s claim for assistance in respect of family
violence by her former de facto partner
lacked merit. This was because the
applicant only provided evidence of property damage, which VCAT held did not
constitute an ‘act of violence’ for the purpose
6.58 In their submission to the Royal Commission, the Magistrates’
Court of Victoria and
the Children’s Court of Victoria noted that the definition of
‘act of violence’ was much narrower than the definition
‘family violence’ in the
Family Violence Protection Act
6.59 The definition of family violence in
section 5(1)
Family Violence
Protection Act
a) behaviour by a person towards a family member of that person if that
i) is physically or sexually abusive; or
ii) is emotionally or psychologically abusive; or iii) is economically
abusive; or
iv) is threatening; or v) is coercive; or
any other way controls or dominates the family member and causes that family
member to feel fear for the safety or wellbeing of
that family member or another
b) behaviour by a person that causes a child to hear or
witness, or otherwise be exposed to the effects of, behaviour referred to
paragraph (a).
6.60 The Royal Commission noted that the discrepancies between the definition
of ‘act of violence’ in the Act and the
definition of ‘family
violence’ in the
Family Violence Protection Act 2008

family violence who experience much the same conduct may have differing
abilities to access the scheme.’
6.61 To demonstrate this point, the Royal Commission gave the example of two
victims of family violence who each receive a text message
in breach of an
intervention order. The first victim, who receives a text message containing a
threat of harm, is eligible to access
the scheme. The second victim, who
receives a text message that breaches an intervention order but does not contain
a threat of harm,
is not eligible to access the
6.62 Furthermore, even where a ‘criminal act’ is alleged that
would constitute an ‘act of violence’ under
the Act, victims of
family violence can have difficulty proving the allegation.
The case law indicates that this is particularly so in relation to sexual
offences, where the dynamics of family violence can make
it difficult to
establish a lack of consent.
6.63 In one case, in which the applicant claimed that her husband had
manipulated her into performing unwanted sexual activity by
making it appear
that the house was under surveillance, both VOCAT and VCAT had difficulty
accepting that the applicant had not consented
to the sexual activity in
In the first VCAT decision, the Deputy
President found that the whole relationship ‘had an air of fantasy about
her lack of consent was only in ‘hindsight’.
In the second VCAT decision, in which the applicant’s claim was
ultimately accepted, the Deputy President questioned how someone
applicant’s position could ‘believe something that is so far-fetched
and preposterous ...?’
6.64 In another case, the VCAT Senior Member cast doubt on the
applicant’s claim that she had been raped by her former boyfriend,
of the affectionate Facebook messages that she had written to him later in life,
in which she had described her former love
for him and her dismay at his lack of
support during her ensuing pregnancy and late-term abortion.
Her claim for assistance was rejected by VCAT.
Establishing an injury
6.65 Another potential barrier for victims of family violence is the
definition of ‘injury’. This
is because if a victim of family violence has not suffered physical injury
and they do not suffer from a mental disorder or illness,
it may be difficult
for them to receive financial assistance.
6.66 As mentioned above, there are case examples in which victims of family
violence who have experienced significant mental harm
as a result of the
violence have had their claims for mental injury refused because they do not
suffer from a recognised mental illness
6.67 Furthermore, while section 3(2) deems ‘trauma’ to be an
injury for the purposes of the Act, it requires that medical
or psychological
evidence must be provided to demonstrate that the trauma requires counselling or
treatment. This may prevent some
victims of family violence from being able to
claim that they have suffered an injury.

assessment to

that the need
to prove mental injury with psychiatric or psychological assessments can
result in victims of family violence being directed away
from frontline and
community-based services. Stakeholders noted that victims of family violence are
sometimes redirected from family
violence counselling and social work services,
which may be of the greatest benefit to their recovery, to medical professionals
they can obtain medical reports that support their VOCAT application. This
was identified as a particular concern for victims of
family violence living in
rural or remote areas, where there are few practising psychiatrists or
psychologists, as it can result
in them seeking support outside of their

injury is property damage or destruction are barred from
receiving assistance

the act of violence.
This is particularly so if they are suffering from a mental disorder or illness

6.72 The applicant in
NF v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
sought assistance on the basis of having
witnessed his father beat his stepfather to death. VOCAT initially refused his
counselling costs on the grounds that the incident in question was
only one of many causes of the difficulties that he faced. The
other issues to
which VOCAT pointed included a sexual assault, a period in residential care, and
a period in youth detention.
However, this decision was later set aside by VCAT, which found that the
applicant’s ‘need for counselling [was] directly
attributable to the
act of violence, even if other layers of trauma in his life may have heightened
CS v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
both VOCAT and VCAT rejected the victim’s application partly

6.76 This is highlighted by the case of
NF v Victims of Crime Assistance
As mentioned above, the applicant
witnessed his father beat his stepfather to death. He initially applied to VOCAT
as a secondary
victim. However, after VOCAT refused his application, he made a
request to amend his application to apply as a related victim. On
appeal, VCAT
accepted this amendment, holding that he ‘was a secondary victim but
he was also a related victim.’
However, it
is notable that NF was unable to apply as a primary victim, despite the severe
psychological impact of the violence on
6.77 This is problematic, as the classification of certain child victims of
family violence as secondary or related victims fails
to acknowledge their lived
experience of family violence and the devastating effect that it may have on
them. As the Royal Commission
‘children and young people experiencing family violence should be
recognised as victims in their own right.’
6.78 In addition, categorising such child victims as secondary or related
victims impacts the categories and quantum of award for
which they are eligible.
As discussed further in Chapter 7, the different victim categories affect the
that an applicant can receive. In particular, only
primary victims are able to apply for special financial
assistance,
which is a lump sum payment for which
the applicant is not required to establish that she or he has suffered an

Perceived barriers to access and lack of awareness of the Act
6.80 Even where a victim of family violence may qualify for assistance under
the Act, there are perceived barriers to accessibility.
6.81 The Royal Commission found that some victims were unaware of their
eligibility for assistance on the basis of family violence.
It heard from one woman who said that she had only discovered that she
could make an application as a victim of family violence after
she had applied
to VOCAT as a victim of a sexual assault.
providers also submitted to the Royal Commission that VOCAT was underused by
victims of family violence.
6.82 This lack of awareness may be attributed to a lack of support and
referral services for victims of family violence. This is
a particular issue
for certain groups of victims. For example, the Royal Commission received a
submission from Gay and Lesbian Health
Victoria noting the lack of support and
referral services for gay, bisexual and trans*

Discussion and options for reform
6.83 This section considers options for reform that could improve access to
financial assistance under the Act for victims of family
6.84 In particular, it discusses the possibility of amending the definitions
of an ‘act of violence’
and ‘injury’ under the Act.
Including ‘family violence’ in the definition of an ‘act
of violence’
6.85 A way of overcoming some of the issues discussed in this chapter would
be to change the definition of an ‘act of violence’
accommodate victims of family violence.
6.86 The Australian Law Reform Commission and New South Wales Law Reform
Commission in their joint report,
Family Violence—A National Legal
recommended
that ‘act of violence’ be defined to explicitly include family
violence, and that victims’ compensation schemes
should ensure that
evidence of a pattern of family violence can be considered.
The Australian Law Reform Commission reiterated this recommendation in
its submission to the Victorian Law Reform Commission in relation
Victims of Crime in the Criminal Trial Process
6.87 If this recommendation were to be implemented, there are a number of
different ways that ‘family violence’ could
be defined in the Act.
This part discusses three options:
• using the definition of ‘family violence’ from section 5

Protection Act 2008
• using a definition of ‘family violence’ that is limited
to offences against the person

such as breaches of family violence intervention

Protection Act 2008
6.88 One way of implementing the recommendation of the Australian Law Reform
Commission and New South Wales Law Reform Commission
to explicitly include
‘family violence’ as an ‘act of violence’ in the Act, is
by importing the definition
of ‘family violence’ found in
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
6.89 As mentioned above, this is a broad definition which includes
non-criminal behaviour, such as economic and psychological abuse,
threats and
6.90 This approach is supported by Christine Forster, who argues that
victims’ financial assistance schemes should adopt family
violence-specific provisions, which define family violence broadly to include
the full range of behaviours that constitute family
violence, including
financial and emotional abuse.
6.91 This is the approach that Queensland recently adopted in an amendment to

of how they

concern about

expanded category may be more complex to determine, and result
in unintended

6.97 This approach could be implemented in the Victorian Act by inserting a
definition of
‘family violence’ into the Act that is limited to personal
violence offences, such as physical and sexual assault.
6.98 Although this approach would not necessarily expand the existing
eligibility criteria, it could enable decision makers to take
into account the
family violence context in which particular acts take place. This approach could
surrounding particular criminal acts, such
as emotionally abusive behaviour, while ensuring consistency with the other
relevant offences
included in the Act’s definition of an ‘act of
violence’, as well as with the Act’s object and purpose.

(including in a residential facility), person
with whom the victim had a
relationship of dependence, parent, guardian, step-parent, child (including by
guardianship), step-child,
half-brother, half-sister,
step-brother and step-sister.
Incorporating non-violent criminal offences
6.99 Another option for reform, which sits in the middle ground, is to insert
a crime-based definition of ‘family violence’
into the Act that
includes non-violent crimes in that definition. This would ensure that the acts
of family violence that give rise
to eligibility for assistance would remain
generally consistent with the purpose of the Act, as they would maintain a
criminal character.
However, by expanding the definition to include other forms
of crimes, the scheme would be opened up to victims of family violence
not of a sexual or physical nature.
6.100 In addition to offences against the person, the Australian Capital
Territory victims of crime financial assistance legislation
provides for a
separate category of ‘domestic violence offences’ which can give
rise to eligibility for financial assistance.
The ‘domestic violence
offences’ listed in that Act are all of a non-violent nature, and include
property offences, such
as destroying or damaging property, arson and trespass,
driving offences, offences involving offensive weapons, and contravention
family violence protection orders.
6.101 The Victorian Act could incorporate this approach by including in its
definition of ‘family violence’ a list of
non-violent criminal acts
that are frequently committed in the family violence context.
6.102 In particular, the definition of ‘family violence’ in the
Act could include breaches of family violence intervention
Section 123
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
(Vic) makes it an offence to
contravene a family violence intervention order with a penalty of level 7
imprisonment (maximum 2 years)
or a level 7 fine (maximum 240 penalty units)
or both. Moreover,
section 123A
makes it an offence punishable by level 6
imprisonment (maximum 5 years) or level 6 fine (maximum 600 penalty units) or
contravene a family violence intervention order with the intention of
causing physical or mental harm or fear for safety.
6.103 The inclusion of these offences in the definition of ‘family
violence’ would create a connection between the Act
Violence Protection Act 2008
(Vic), even if the same definition of
‘family violence’ is not used. Furthermore, it would overcome the
anomaly that the
Royal Commission identified in terms of eligibility under the
whereby two victims of family violence who experience substantially similar
conduct may have differing abilities to access the scheme.
As described above,
the Royal Commission noted that because of the definition of an ‘act of
violence’ under the Act,
victims of breaches of intervention orders which
do not involve assault, injury or the threat of injury, are currently ineligible
for financial assistance.
6.104 Another class of offence that could be included in the definition of
‘family violence’ in the Act is crimes against
property. As outlined
above, property damage and economic abuse are common forms of family violence
that can have far-reaching consequences
for victims.
6.105 There has been consideration of whether an ‘act of
violence’ should be expanded to include property offences outside
context of family violence.
6.106 For example, as part of its reference on victims of crime in the
criminal trial process, the Commission received a submission
eligibility criteria in the Act should be expanded to include property offences
such as property damage, burglary and online
Victoria Police also submitted that it was open to this option, noting
that victims of non-violent offences tend to suffer from the
same type of
psychological, emotional and social impacts as victims of crimes against the
Victims of Crime (Financial Assistance) Act 2016
(ACT), div.

The Role of Victims of Crime in the Criminal Trial Process
October 2015) 31–2.
6.107 However, the Commission decided there was no compelling reason for
such an expansion.
In arriving at this conclusion,
the Commission took into account the Magistrates’ Court’s submission
that ‘expanding
eligibility to victims of non-violent and property crimes
would substantially increase the number and complexity of claims and the
of the scheme’.
6.108 In addition, the Commission noted Victoria Police’s
submission that the expansion of crimes compensation schemes to
cover property
offences could act as a disincentive for individuals to obtain property
It also referred to the New Zealand
Law Commission’s consideration of this issue in its 2010 report,
Compensating Crime Victims,
which found that
state-funded compensation for property loss would provide little social benefit
and could create fundamental problems,
such as those relating to property
6.109 It should be noted, however, that concerns relating to property
insurance may not be applicable in the context of family violence.
because victims of family violence may already be precluded from making
insurance claims for property damage which
results from the actions of a family member whose name is also on the
insurance policy. Therefore, by limiting the property offences
that can give
rise to eligibility for assistance under the Act to those committed as part of
family violence, the Act may not operate
as a disincentive to taking out
property insurance.
Changing the requirements for ‘injury’
6.110 Another option for reform is to expand the injuries covered by the Act.
Meyering writes that the definition of ‘mental
injury’ in the
Victorian Act is one of the most restrictive
in Australia.
She contrasts it with other
‘mental and nervous
and ‘impairment of ... mental
6.111 Any one of these less restrictive variations could be adopted in
Victoria. This would make the scheme more accessible to victims
violence who do not have a recognised mental disorder or illness. It would also
reduce the need to obtain a psychiatric
assessment report, thereby allowing
victims of family violence to pursue counselling or other services that are
suited to their needs,
rather than medical reports geared only toward their
legal application.
6.112 Alternatively, or additionally, the Act could be amended to include a
broader range of injuries for victims of family violence.
Both the Australian
Capital Territory and Queensland schemes recognise an expanded category of
injuries for victims of sexual offences
and family violence, including a sense
of violation, a reduced sense of self-worth, increased
fear or feelings of insecurity, and reduced capacity to participate in sexual
Victorian Act could also recognise such injuries in relation to family
6.113 Another option for reform is to remove the requirement of proof of
injury for victims of family violence. Forster suggests that
this would have

approach could be applied to family violence in the Victorian Act.
6.115 Forster advocates for a model of financial assistance whereby victims
of family violence can access set categories of award
depending on the severity
of the family violence, without requiring proof of injury.
This model could be incorporated into the Act by explicitly adding
different forms of family violence to the categories of special
assistance. The categories of special financial assistance are discussed further
in Chapter 7. As the Victorian scheme
currently stands, this would mean that
victims of family violence would only need to prove that they had suffered a
‘significant
adverse effect’ in order to be eligible for assistance.
Alternatively, the Act could be amended so that victims need only to

Introduction
7.1 This chapter outlines the different forms of financial assistance
available to victims of crime under the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act). In particular, this chapter considers:
the categories
and quantum of awards, including the total financial assistance available and
the different types of assistance that
victims of crime can

7.2 This chapter relates to the second matter in the terms of reference,
which asks the Commission to consider, within the total financial
available, the categories and quantum of awards with regard to the cumulative
impact of family violence behaviour on victims.
7.3 The chapter then considers the ways in which the provisions dealing with
the categories and quantum of awards do not take into
account the cumulative
harm caused by a pattern of family violence, which may occur over a long period
of time and involve multiple
acts of violence.
7.4 Finally, this chapter outlines options for reform to improve the adequacy
of the financial assistance for victims of family violence
and poses questions
for consideration.
Categories and quantum of awards
7.5 The categories and quantum of awards available to victims of crime are
set out in sections
8, 10, 13 and 15 of the Act and are organised according to the class of
victim under which an applicant makes a claim for financial
assistance.
7.6 Special financial assistance for primary victims is dealt with
under section 8A of the Act and the
Victims of Crime Assistance (Special
Financial Assistance) Regulations 2011
(Vic) (the Regulations).
7.7 Section 4 of the Act sets out how the Victims of Crime Assistance
Tribunal (VOCAT)
should treat ‘related criminal acts’.
Total financial assistance available
7.8 The Act limits the amount of assistance that can be awarded to a
particular victim in respect of an act of violence.
7.9 The maximum award for primary victims is $60,000 plus $10,000 of special
financial assistance.

‘family member, in relation to a person’ is defined in s 10A(3) of
the Act as a spouse, domestic partner, former spouse,
former domestic partner, a
child who normally or regularly resides with that person, a person who is or has
been ordinarily a member
of the household of that person or a relative of that
person. ‘Relative’ is further defined in s 10A(4) of the Act as
father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, step-father, step-mother,
father-in-law, mother-in-law, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter,
step-daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother, sister, half-brother,
half-sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law,
uncle, aunt, uncle-in-law,
aunt-in-law, nephew, niece, cousin, or anyone who would be a relative of the
domestic partner if they
were married.
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
7.15 Related victims can make a claim for the following:
• Expenses actually incurred or reasonably likely to be incurred
– reasonable counselling services
– medical expenses actually and reasonably incurred or reasonably
likely to be incurred or funeral expenses as a direct result
of the death of the
primary victim
– distress experienced or reasonably likely to be experienced as a
direct result of the death of the primary victim
– loss of money that the related victim, but for the death of the
primary victim, would have been reasonably likely to receive
from the primary
victim during a period of up to two years after that death
– other expenses actually and reasonably incurred or reasonably likely
to be incurred as a direct result of the primary victim’s
In exceptional
circumstances, and within the limit of the total sum available to related
victims, other expenses actually and reasonably

7.16 A person who
incurs the funeral expenses of a primary victim, but who is not a related
victim, is also able to make a claim for
assistance for those
The maximum cumulative amount that may be
awarded to a pool of related victims will be reduced by any award made in
respect of funeral
7.17 Other than claims made by primary victims for safety-related expenses
and clothing worn at the time of the act of violence, the
Act explicitly
excludes applications for expenses incurred through loss or damage to
7.18 As noted above, the Act expressly requires most expenses for which an
application for financial assistance is made to be ‘reasonable’.
7.19 The term ‘reasonable’ has been judicially considered.
CS v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) considered the
meaning of ‘reasonable’ in the context of ‘reasonable
counselling services’ under section 8(2)(a)
of the Act. In that case VCAT referred to the definition of
‘reasonable’ in the
Oxford English Dictionary
greatly less or more than might be expected; inexpensive, not
extortionate’. VCAT also drew assistance from the
definition of
‘reasonable’ in the
Transport Accident Act 1986
(Vic), which
requires the decision maker to have regard to the service actually rendered and
the necessity of that service in the
circumstances.
7.20 In that case, VCAT concluded that the applicant’s claim for
counselling, which had been received on a weekly to fortnightly
basis for five
years, was unreasonable, due to there being little evidence of improvement,
there having been no attempt to reduce
the counselling sessions, and there being
other factors in the applicant’s life that VCAT considered had contributed
need for counselling.
7.21 VCAT has also considered the meaning of ‘exceptional
circumstances’ for the purposes of making a claim for additional
‘recovery expenses’. In
Mendez v Victims of Crime Assistance
a case concerning a claim for
financial assistance with respect
to an assault by the applicant’s ex-partner, VCAT held that
‘exceptional circumstances’
means ‘circumstances out of the ordinary

23 Ibid [49].
VCAT held that whether or not
exceptional circumstances exist involves a consideration of ‘all of the
circumstances, including
the injury and the nature of the
offending’.
VCAT has also considered the
therapeutic value of the particular expense
7.22 Assistance can be awarded under the ‘recovery expenses’
category for a diverse range of items and services. In
Mendez v Victims of
Crime Assistance Tribunal,
for example, VCAT
awarded the applicant financial assistance under this category for a gym
membership and equipment for a beauty therapy
Hay v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
which concerned child sexual assault (outside the context of family
violence), VCAT awarded financial assistance for the removal of
tattoos, finding
that it would assist the applicant to obtain employment, which would likely be a
key element in his recovery.
7.23 The Commission also heard in preliminary consultations that the
‘recovery expenses’ category is sometimes used by
victims of family
violence to recover expenses flowing from financial abuse or property damage,
which would otherwise be unavailable
under the Act.
Special financial assistance
7.24 In addition to assistance for specific expenses incurred or likely to be
incurred, the Act provides that primary victims can
be awarded special financial
assistance.
7.25 Special financial assistance is a lump sum that can be awarded as
‘a symbolic expression by the state of the community’s
sympathy and
condolence for, and recognition of, significant adverse effects experienced or
suffered by them as victims of crime’.
meaning of ‘significant adverse effect’, and its implications for
victims of family violence, is discussed in Chapter
7.26 Special financial assistance is classified into four categories; A, B, C
and D. These categories are based on the severity of
the act of violence, with
Category A covering the most serious offences and Category D covering the least
7.27 The offences that fall into each category are set out in the schedule in
Crime Assistance (Special Financial Assistance) Regulations 2011
(Vic). They are as follows:
• Category A: offences involving sexual penetration and attempted
Category B:
offences involving attempted sexual penetration, an indecent act, an indecent
assault, armed robbery, aggravated burglary
and deprivation of liberty for the
purpose of sexual penetration or demanding a ransom
C: offences involving an attempt to commit any of the offences in Category
B, a death threat, conduct endangering life, the infliction of serious injury
and robbery
Category D:
offences involving an attempt to commit any of the offences in Category C, a
threat of injury, assault, attempted assault,
deprivation of liberty (other than
for sexual penetration or ransom) and any other act of
7.28 The minimum and maximum amounts for each category are
prescribed in section 8A(5)
of the Act. They appear in Table 1.

financial assistance
Minimum amount
Maximum amount
7.29 The Regulations, however, provide for three circumstances in which a
higher maximum award of special financial assistance is
available for acts of
violence that would ordinarily fall within a category with a lower maximum
award. In practice, this is often
described as an ‘uplift’.
7.30 First, regulation 7 provides that the Category A maximum amount is
available for acts of violence in Categories B, C and D where:
• the victim has suffered a very serious physical injury
• the victim has been infected with a very serious disease or
the applicant
has been the victim of related criminal acts being acts of indecent assault or
sexual penetration.
7.31 The Regulations define ‘very serious
injury’ as ‘actual physical bodily harm to the body of a permanent
long term duration that involves loss of a body function, disfigurement
of a part of the body, total or partial loss of a part of the body, loss of a
foetus or loss of fertility’.
7.32 ‘Very serious disease’ is defined as ‘a disease that
is life threatening in nature and includes
7.33 Secondly, regulation 8 provides that the Category B maximum is
available for acts of violence in Category C or D where the victim
was a child,
elderly or impaired at the time of the act of violence and:
• the victim has suffered a serious injury
• the victim has suffered deprivation of liberty or
• the applicant has been the victim of related criminal acts of
7.34 ‘Serious injury’ is not defined in the Regulations. However,
VCAT has held that ‘serious’ should be given

Moisidis v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT found that the applicant suffered
from a ‘serious injury’ due to his ongoing need to take Panadeine
neck pain, his difficulties moving his neck and the fact that he continued to
experience a buzzing sound in his ears and had severe
headaches approximately
three to four times
VCAT also took into account the fact that
he had symptoms of post-traumatic stress, which could develop into a
post-traumatic stress
7.36 In contrast, in
Tucker v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT found that a small bite wound
requiring stitches and two courses of antibiotics did not constitute a
‘serious injury’.
This was because, despite leaving a residual mark,
the injury presented no further

circumstances:

• They each contribute to the injury or death for
which an application is made; or
• VOCAT considers that they ought to be treated as related criminal
7.40 The effect of the ‘related criminal acts’ provision is to
reduce the amount of financial assistance payable to a
victim of multiple
related crimes.
7.41 However, VOCAT has the discretion not to treat ‘related
criminal acts’ as a single act if it considers that

7.42 Furthermore, as outlined above, there are circumstances in which the
existence of a series of ‘related criminal acts’
can increase the
amount of special financial assistance available. To summarise, these
circumstances are as follows:
applicant is a victim of a series of related criminal acts falling within
Category D, the maximum award available is increased
from the Category D maximum
amount ($650) to the Category C maximum amount
applicant is a victim of a series of related acts of indecent assault or sexual
penetration, the maximum award available
for acts falling within Category B
($3250), Category C ($1300) or Category D ($650) is increased to that of
Category A ($10,000).
applicant is the victim of a series of related criminal acts and they were a
child, elderly or impaired at the time that

fewer awards and lesser amounts of assistance from VOCAT
than other victims of

as an ‘isolated random act of a deviant
rather than something that can occur
over a long period of time and within an intimate setting. As Victoria Legal Aid

Commission), the Act is better suited to ‘one- off’ acts
of violence
where the victim and perpetrator are not known to each
7.45 This submission is reflected in the categories and quantum of awards
available under the Act. In particular, the Royal Commission
noted that the
‘related criminal acts’ provision and the special financial
assistance categories do not sufficiently
take into account the cumulative harm
of family violence.
7.46 This part considers the difficulties that these provisions present for
victims of family violence, including children.
Prevalence of awards for family violence victims
7.47 In the VOCAT
Annual Report 2015–16,
VOCAT recorded 388
applications for assistance due to family violence. Of those applications for
assistance, VOCAT records that it
113 awards.
This means that 29 per cent of family
violence applications were granted.
7.48 This may be compared to the numbers recorded in respect of other
categories of offence.
In the 2015–2016 financial year, 69 per cent of applications made
concerning assault were granted,
76 per cent
concerning robbery were granted
and 67 per cent
rape were granted.
7.49 These numbers appear to indicate that applications for assistance in
relation to family violence tend to be less successful than
those made in
relation to other criminal acts. It is not clear why this is the case. The
difficulties that victims of family violence
encounter in relation to the
eligibility test, as discussed in the previous chapter, may contribute to the
relatively low number
of successful applications for this group of victims.
7.50 It should, however, be noted that the data may not represent the full
picture. VOCAT noted in its
Annual Report 2015
only began recording the number of applications lodged in respect of family
violence part way through the 2015–2016
financial year. This means that
the numbers reported do not represent a full year of applications.
7.51 Preliminary consultations also indicated that the way that family
violence matters are currently recorded is predominantly based
on whether or not
the applicant describes the ‘act of violence’ as ‘family
violence’. This means that some
applications identified as relating to
physical or sexual assault may also relate to family violence.
Quantum of awards for family violence victims
7.52 There is limited data on the amount of financial assistance usually
received by victims of family violence.

7.53 However, the Royal Commission did identify some aspects of the scheme
which may result in victims of family violence receiving
smaller awards compared
to victims of other criminal acts. These were:
• the ‘related criminal acts’ provision
• the categories of special financial assistance.
7.54 These issues are discussed further below.
The related criminal acts provision
7.55 As mentioned above, the Act provides that a series of ‘related
criminal acts’ can
be considered a single criminal act if they ‘occurred over a period of
time and were committed by the same person or group of
7.56 This provision can operate to disproportionately reduce the awards
received by victims of family violence.
because ‘Domestic violence, almost by definition, will involve repeated
acts of abuse by the same offender’.
7.57 As the Magistrates’ Court and Children’s Court jointly
submitted to the Royal Commission, the related criminal acts
that a victim of long-term, chronic family violence (a series of related
acts) is placed on an equivalent footing to someone who has
been injured in a
one-off assault, for example in a brawl between
7.58 As part of their report into family violence, the Australian Law Reform
Commission and New South Wales Law Reform Commission
received a submission from
the Wirringa Baiya Aboriginal Women’s Legal Centre Inc, stating that:
... it is grossly unfair and unjust that a victim of multiple acts of
violence should be disadvantaged by the fact that her offender
happens to be the
same person to another applicant who was the victim of different acts of
violence committed by different offenders.
7.59 Forster illustrates this point with the example of a retailer who is the
victim of a series of robberies by different offenders.
While the acts of violence perpetrated against such a victim might be
very similar in nature, the victim would be unlikely to have
their claim reduced
due to the robberies having been carried out by different
perpetrators.
In contrast, a victim of a series of acts of family violence perpetrated by
the same family member or group of family members, would
be likely to receive a
reduced award.
7.60 Despite the issues discussed here, preliminary consultations undertaken
by the Commission indicated that the fact that the ‘related
acts’ provision enables victims of family violence to make only one
application, rather than multiple, can benefit
the applicant by simplifying the
process. Nevertheless, this benefit was often seen to be outweighed by the
drawback of having a
victim’s claim reduced.

Limitations of special financial assistance for family violence victims
7.61 Another key issue raised in the Royal Commission was that the
special financial assistance categories do ‘not sufficiently
account the cumulative harm of individual acts of violence as a result of
experiencing persistent and protracted
7.62 This is because the relevant categories are based on the severity of a
single offence, rather than the overall impact of a pattern
7.63 The Royal Commission found that victims of family violence who are not
victims of criminal acts in the higher categories, such
as attempted murder or
offences involving sexual penetration (Category A):
... may only be eligible for the amount tied to the ‘less
serious’ offences in perhaps category D or C—despite potentially
having endured these ‘less serious’ offences over a long period of
7.64 The Royal Commission heard from one witness who made two separate
applications to VOCAT, one for a rape by a stranger and one
in respect of family
violence. She received an award of $10,000 for the rape and $1000 for the family
violence. The victim stated
that she found it ‘odd that [family violence]
weighed less on the scale’, considering the devastating effect the family
violence had had on her life compared to the rape ‘which was horrible ...
but ... was one night of [her] life’.
7.65 In their submission to the Royal Commission, the Magistrates’
Court and the Children’s Court also provided the example
of a Koori woman
who had endured years of physical and psychological abuse by her former partner,
only to receive $1300 in special
financial assistance because the acts of
violence that she had experienced fell within Category
7.66 While the maximum award for a category of special financial assistance
can be increased where there has been a series of ‘related
acts’, the Magistrates’ Court and Children’s Court pointed out
to the Royal Commission that this can only
be done in limited
circumstances.
7.67 As mentioned above, a series of ‘related criminal acts’ will
only operate to increase the maximum award available
where those acts fall
within Category D (increasing the maximum to Category C),
where the acts constitute indecent assault or sexual
penetration
or where the victim was a child,
elderly or impaired at the time of the acts.
7.68 Another concern with the availability of special financial assistance
under the Act is that it may not adequately account for
the experiences of child
family violence victims.
7.69 The fact that special financial assistance can only be awarded to
primary victims means that many child family violence victims
are unable to
access it. This is because children often experience family violence by hearing,
witnessing or otherwise being exposed
to it, rather than by having the violence
directly perpetrated against them. As a consequence, many child victims are
as secondary or related victims under the Act.
7.70 Further, even where a child is recognised as a primary victim and
therefore able to claim special financial assistance, the categories
financial assistance do not sufficiently acknowledge the long-term and
far-reaching consequences of experiencing family
violence as a child. While being a child at the time of the act of violence
enables a primary victim to be eligible for a higher maximum
award of special
financial assistance

Discussion and options for reform
7.71 In order to ensure that the Act takes into account the cumulative harm
experienced by victims of family violence, consideration
could be given to
amending both the ‘related criminal acts’ provision and the special
financial assistance categories.
This part provides different options for reform
with respect to these two parts of the scheme.
Reframing the ‘related criminal acts’ provision
7.72 One way to overcome some of the issues outlined in this chapter is to
reframe the ‘related criminal acts’ provision
so that it does not
unfairly affect victims of family violence.
7.73 The Australian Law Reform Commission and New South Wales Law Reform
Commission in their joint report,
Family Violence—A National Legal
recommended that victims’
compensation schemes should not provide that acts are ‘related’
merely because they are
committed by the same
7.74 This recommendation could be implemented by adding other criteria to the
circumstances in which acts carried out by the same
perpetrator or group of
perpetrators are considered
‘related’. For example, section 4(a) of the Act could be amended
to require that the acts were committed by the same person
share some other common factor in order to be ‘related’, rather than
these being separate and distinct criteria
as is currently under the Act.
7.75 The recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission and New South
Wales Law Reform Commission could also be implemented
by removing the reference
to the same perpetrator or perpetrators in subsection 4(a)(ii) of the Act all
7.76 Both of these options would reduce the circumstances in which a victim
of family violence would have her or his claim for multiple
acts of violence
reduced, due to the fact that those acts were performed by the same family
7.77 However, Forster argues that the recommendation of the Australian Law
Reform Commission and New South Wales Law Reform Commission
does not go far
enough. She writes that the other grounds that are used to collapse multiple
crimes into a single crime would still
disproportionately affect victims of
family violence.
This is because acts of family
violence frequently share other ‘common factors’. For example,
‘the acts of violence
are often similar (whether physical, sexual,
emotional or economic) and typically occur ... in the same location (the family
7.78 This means that even if the reference to the same perpetrator in section
4 of the Act were removed, related acts of family violence
may still be treated
as a single act. This could be because they ‘share some other common
factor’ under subsection 4(1)(a)(iii)
or because the ‘Tribunal
considers that they ought to be treated as related criminal acts’ under
subsection 4(1)(c) of

7.79 In light of these concerns, another option could be to exclude family
violence from the operation of the ‘related criminal
provision. Alternatively, the Act could be amended so that only acts of violence
committed at the same time are considered
7.80 The Australian Capital Territory legislation offers another possibility.
Section 44(2)
Victims of Crime (Financial Assistance) Act 2016
(ACT) provides two examples of related criminal acts. Offences are
considered to be related if they involve the same offender and
same primary
victim; or if the offences are contemporaneous or near contemporaneous (that is,
they happen at the same time, or nearly
so). However,
section 44(3)
of that Act
only that related acts of violence be treated as a single act in
three circumstances:
• where the series of offences are (or are likely to be) part of a
single ongoing offence
where treating
the acts separately would result in the applicant receiving an amount of
financial assistance that is disproportionate
to the totality of harm that they
• in circumstances prescribed by regulation.
7.81 This model addresses some of the unfairness of the Victorian Act by
separating the circumstances in which multiple acts are considered
related, and
those in which they must be treated as a single act. This shifts the emphasis
away from the similarity between the acts,
to a consideration of the nature of
the crime and the severity of the harm suffered.
In doing so, this approach is less likely to result in victims of family
violence having their claims reduced. This is because,
while acts of family
violence might be related, their cumulative harm can be significant.
Amending the special financial assistance categories
7.82 One way to ensure that the Act takes into account the cumulative
harm of persistent and protracted family violence is to
amend the special
financial assistance categories so that a higher award is available for a series
of acts of family violence.
7.83 In their submission to the Royal Commission, the Magistrates’
Court and Children’s Court recommended that the regulations
be amended to
include a series of acts of family violence as a circumstance in which the
Category A maximum is available for offences
that fall within Categories B, C
7.84 This could be achieved by adding ‘family violence’ to
regulation 7(c) of the Regulations as one of the circumstances
(along with
indecent assault and sexual penetration) in which a series of criminal acts can
be compensated by the Category A maximum
7.85 An alternative option is to explicitly recognise a pattern of family
violence within one of the higher categories of special
financial assistance.
The Northern Territory victims’ assistance scheme recognises
‘domestic violence injuries’
as a distinct compensable category of
injury for which a victim can receive a lump sum. ‘Domestic violence
are defined as injury resulting from a series of three or more
related criminal acts committed by an offender with whom the victim
domestic relationship, or stalking in contravention of a domestic violence
order. For this category of compensable injury,
victims can be awarded between
$7500 and $10,000. This approach could be adopted
in the Victorian legislation by inserting a series of related acts of family
violence into
Category A or B.
7.86 Forster suggests a similar but more detailed model that takes into
account the severity of family violence, as well as the cumulative
effect of a
pattern of abuse. She recommends that different forms of family violence should
give rise to eligibility for different
categories of special financial
assistance. Forster contends that a series of acts of family violence of
a sexual or physical nature should occupy the category with the highest award
79 Magistrates’ Court of Victoria and Children’s Court of
Victoria, Submission No 978 to Royal Commission into Family
Commission into Family Violence
(June 2015) 50.
80 Ibid (Recommendation 25).
series of non-physical acts of family violence should occupy the second
highest award range, and victims of a single act of family
violence should be
eligible for the lowest range.
7.87 Forster’s model could be implemented in the Victorian scheme
either by adopting a separate scale of categories that specifically
family violence or by assigning different forms of family violence (based on the
a pattern) to the special financial
assistance categories currently listed in the Regulations. For example, a
pattern of family violence
that involves physical or sexual acts of violence
could be listed in Category A, a pattern of other forms of family violence in
B and single acts of family violence that do not already fall into
Category A or B could be listed in Category C or D.
7.88 Another option, brought to the Commission’s attention during
preliminary consultations, is to remove the categories of
special financial
assistance entirely, or at least in relation to victims of family violence.
Under this approach, the maximum amount
of special financial assistance for any
application based on family violence would be $10,000. VOCAT would determine the
appropriate
award of special financial assistance based on a variety of factors,
including the severity of the criminal acts, the severity of
the injuries
suffered and whether there was a pattern of abuse.
7.89 In addition, in order to ensure that the Act better takes into account
the experience of child victims of family violence and
the effect of that
violence, the Act could be amended so that special financial assistance is
available to all child victims of family
violence, whether or not they are
classified as primary victims under the Act. This would enable children to be
able to access a
lump sum payment no matter what form their experience of family
violence takes.
7.90 The Regulations could also be amended so that the fact that a victim was
a child at the time of the act of violence is an uplift
category on its own.
This is the approach in the Australian Capital Territory, which provides that
where a victim is under 18 years
old at the time of the offence, this alone is a
‘circumstance of aggravation’.
7.91 The Commission seeks the views of victims, persons affected,
professionals, stakeholders and the community on how to better accommodate
family violence within the categories
and quantum of awards available under the Act. Specific questions are set out
‘Related criminal acts’
the definition of ‘related criminal acts’ be amended to have regard
to the cumulative impact of family violence
on victims? If so, how should this
the definition of ‘related criminal acts’ be amended to ensure that
acts are not just related merely because they
are committed by the same
offender? If so, how should this be done?

13 Alternatively, should family violence be excluded from the operation of
‘related criminal acts’ provision? If so, how should this be
reflected in the Act?

Introduction
8.1 This chapter outlines how an application is made to the Victims of Crime

Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act) and the time periods within which an application must be
brought. The time limit for bringing an application is distinct
from the time
frames for making awards, which are discussed in Chapter 11.
8.2 While these issues are not specifically covered in the terms of
reference, an overview of this process is included because it
is an integral
part of making an application for financial assistance to VOCAT.
8.3 The Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence (the Royal
Commission) specifically identified the time limit for making an
application as
a potential barrier for victims of family
8.4 This chapter begins by outlining the required form of an application for
assistance to
VOCAT and the two-year time period for the making of an application.
8.5 This chapter then discusses the implications of the two-year time limit
for applicants who are victims of family violence. In
particular, the chapter
notes the difficulties that can arise, given the higher rate of late
applications among victims of family
8.6 Finally, this chapter provides options for reform with respect to the
time limit, and poses questions for consideration.
Form of application
8.7 An application for assistance to VOCAT must be made in writing in the
prescribed form.
A copy of this form, together with guidance information, is provided at
Appendix C. The form must be accompanied by documentary
8.8 If the applicant has not reported the act of violence to the police, the
form must also be accompanied by a statutory declaration
by the applicant
setting out the circumstances of the act of violence and the reasons that they
did not report the matter.
8.9 The form has 12 parts:
1) Details of the applicant.
2) Section to be completed if the claim is being made on behalf of a child
or a person with a disability.

6) Whether the applicant would prefer to have the matter
resolved ‘on the papers’ or
if they would like a hearing before VOCAT. If the applicant wishes to have a
hearing, they can ask for the proceedings to be conducted
in closed court.
7) Whether the applicant has applied for assistance under any other schemes,
including the Victims Assistance Program, Workcover,
the Transport Accident
Commission,
as well as any benefits the applicant has received or is entitled to receive
under a superannuation or insurance scheme.
8) The type of assistance that the applicant wishes to claim from VOCAT,
including expenses incurred, expenses to assist in recovery
and special
financial assistance. The applicant must indicate whether they are applying as
a primary, secondary or related victim,
or whether they are claiming funeral
expenses only.
9) If a death was caused by the act of violence, the applicant must also
give details of the deceased.
10) If the applicant is a related victim, they must list every person who
they believe may be or may claim to be a related victim,
and they can also apply
for assistance with funeral expenses.
11) The applicant’s authorisation for VOCAT to obtain any other
evidence necessary.
12) An acknowledgment by the applicant that all information provided is
true and correct.
8.10 The form explicitly asks whether the alleged offender is a family member
or domestic partner of the victim and asks the applicant
to specify their
relationship to them. It also asks if there are any intervention orders relating
to the matter.
8.11 An application for assistance and the supporting documentation can be
lodged in hard copy or online via the VOCAT
8.12 Hard-copy applications for assistance must be lodged with or posted to
the VOCAT venue closest to the applicant’s place
However, if there are multiple applicants
in respect of one act of violence, it must be the venue closest to where the act
of violence
was committed.
If the Chief Magistrate

applicant had been between five and 10 years old at the
time of the offences and
that her grandfather had been in a position of power and trust over her, which
was compounded by her fear
of being excluded from her large Koori kinship group.
VCAT also considered the fact that the psychological effect of the abuse meant
that the applicant took many years before she
told anyone and that she had not been aware of her mental injury until
relatively recently. In addition, VCAT found that the delay
did not threaten the
Tribunal’s capacity to make
a fair decision, as there was sufficient evidence of the injury and the
alleged perpetrator had died before the applicant had attained
8.25 Similarly, in
J v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT overturned VOCAT’s decision
to strike out the applicant’s application, even though it was made 35
years after the
alleged sexual abuse by her brother-in-law had occurred. VCAT
considered the fact that the applicant was 13 to 18 years old when
the acts of
violence took place, the brother-
in-law’s relative position of power as an adult family member and a
teacher, and the particular dynamics of the applicant’s
family, including
her isolation from her siblings, their inability to discuss sex or emotions and
their excessive respect for adults
and teachers. VCAT also took into account the
psychological evidence that the trauma of the incidents had contributed to the
applicant’s
delay in making a claim.
8.26 In contrast, in the cases of
S v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
BFK v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT upheld VOCAT’s decision to
strike out the applications for being out-of-time. This was despite both
applicants being a
similar age to the
applicant in
J v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
when the acts of
violence took place
(17 and 18 years old respectively).
S v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
distinguished that case from
J v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
the basis that the perpetrator had not been in a position of power, influence or
trust over the applicant and that there was no
psychiatric evidence linking the
trauma of the rape to the applicant’s delay in making an
application.
BFK v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
, VCAT found that
the perpetrator had not been in a position of power, influence or trust over the
applicant—despite being her
boyfriend—due to the fact that he was
‘only one year older than her and ... clearly troubled, rather than ...
calculating
and controlling’.
VCAT also held
that the delay
in making the application threatened the Tribunal’s ability to make a
fair decision, particularly in light of the alleged perpetrator’s
conflicting testimony and the lack of evidence supporting the applicant’s

8.29 Beyond the specific factors listed in the Act, VOCAT also has discretion
to consider ‘all other circumstances’.
This catch-all provision is typically used to consider common law
factors, such as the prospect of success of the substantive
8.30 However, the Act explicitly provides that VOCAT must not decide to
further hear and determine an out-of-time application only
because the applicant
was unaware of Victoria’s victims of crime financial assistance scheme or
the time limit.
Effect of the form on family violence victims
8.31 Preliminary consultations undertaken by the Victorian Law Reform
Commission (the
Commission) indicated that the application form is relatively straightforward
often be completed without legal assistance. It was noted, however, that
further requests for documentation by VOCAT can make the
process more difficult
to navigate and often can require legal assistance. VOCAT’s powers of
investigation are discussed in
8.32 One significant concern raised by stakeholders in relation to family
violence victims and the application form was that it is
tailored towards
victims of a ‘one-off’ act of violence. The form uses singular
language, such as ‘What was the
act of violence/offence?’ and
leaves a small space for the applicant to answer. It also asks for the
‘date of the act
of violence’ and has a section for the time at
which the act occurred. Although the form provides an option for putting in
span of dates, it also requires the applicant to insert a start and end date.
The ‘reporting details’ section also
asks singular questions, such
as the date of the report and the police officer’s name. These issues
reflect the considerations
of context and continuity of family violence reviewed
in Chapter 3.
8.33 These features of the form can make it difficult for victims of family
violence to complete.
They may be making an application for a series of acts that occurred over a
long period of time, with no clear beginning or end, and
which may have been
reported multiple times
to different police officers.
Effect of the time limit on family violence victims
8.34 As the Royal Commission noted, the time limit of two years on making an
application to
VOCAT can be a barrier for victims of family
8.35 It can take victims of family violence a considerable amount of time to
disclose their experiences.
The reasons are complex.
Many victims experience family violence, especially of a sexual nature, as
This can hamper victims from pursuing
financial assistance within the time limit.
victims of family violence may also fear reprisal from their partners or
ex-partners, hindering them from making a timely
application.
8.36 Other victims of family violence might feel distrust towards the legal
system, which can deter them from making a prompt application.
Christine Forster
writes that this is especially so for Aboriginal women, who are more likely to
be unwilling to report family violence
due to factors such as ‘a history
of discrimination by institutional structures ... [and] community pressure to
keep the matter
from the scrutiny of the
government’.

8.37 For some victims of family violence, it may take a while to regain
enough stability in their lives to even consider making a
claim. The Royal
Commission heard from one woman that the two-year time limit is:
no time at all to go through the emotional trauma of appealing to the
Tribunal for compensation. It takes a lot of time and effort
for a mother to
gain a normality and routine in her life for herself and for her
8.38 It can also take a long time for victims of family violence to
acknowledge what has happened to them or to understand the causal
link between
their injuries and the family violence.
In addition,
a substantial period of time may elapse between the act(s) of violence occurring
and the victim developing an injury.
8.39 This is particularly an issue in relation to child victims of family
violence, and especially where the violence is of a sexual
nature. As Forster
and Parkinson write, ‘the harm suffered by child sexual abuse victims
‘may not manifest itself until
many years after the
For example, in the case of
Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
, although the alleged sexual abuse took
place in the 1980s, the applicant’s resulting mental injury did not appear
until around
20 years later.
8.40 The fact that it may take a victim of family violence longer to lodge an
application for assistance with VOCAT means that the
time limit of two years can
have ‘a disproportionate impact on their eligibility for
compensation’.
8.41 In deciding whether to grant an extension of time, section 29(3) of the
Act allows VOCAT to consider certain factors that are
relevant to family
violence, such as whether the perpetrator was in a position of power, trust or
influence over the applicant. However,
on appeal, this factor has been interpreted narrowly by VCAT so as to exclude
some situations of family violence. As mentioned above,
BFK v Victims of
Crime Assistance Tribunal
, VCAT held that the alleged perpetrator was not in
a position of power, trust or influence over the applicant even though he was
her boyfriend at the time of the act of violence.
8.42 VOCAT is also able to have regard to ‘whether the applicant was a
child at the time of the occurrence of the act of violence
and the application
was made within a reasonable time after he or she reached the age of
Although this factor acknowledges that
children may experience difficulty in making an application while they are under
not assist child victims of family violence who take many years to
come to terms the abuse
that they have suffered if their delay is not considered
‘reasonable’.
8.43 Furthermore, while VOCAT frequently grants applications for an extension
of time, preliminary consultations disclosed that the
mere existence of a time
limit can be a barrier for victims of family violence whose claims relate to
events that occurred many years
Discussion and options for reform
Ensuring that the form accounts for family violence
8.44 An option for reform to make the VOCAT application process easier and
more accessible for victims of family violence is to use
language that is not
confined to singular acts of violence or singular reports to police. For
example, the form could ask the applicant
whether they are the victim of a
single act of violence or a series of acts of violence.

8.45 In addition, the form could leave larger spaces for applicants who
describe multiple acts of violence, so that they are able
to describe the nature
of the violence that they have encountered, the general time frame and the
reporting details without being
restricted to one or two-word answers.
Overcoming issues of timing
8.46 The Act could be amended in several ways to remove the difficulties
facing victims of family violence in relation to the time
8.47 One option is to increase the time limit for applications relating to
family violence. This is the approach taken in the New
South Wales legislation,
which provides for a 10-year time limit for victims of domestic violence, child
abuse or sexual assault.
If the victim was a child
at the time of the act of violence, then the 10-year time limit starts running
from the day that they turn
18, rather than the act of
As such, this approach
acknowledges that victims of family violence may need more time to make an
application for assistance, as well the fact that the time
needed by child
victims may be even longer.
8.48 Another option is to add family violence to the list of factors in
section 29(3) of the Act that VOCAT must consider when making
a decision on
whether or not to strike out a late application. This would ensure that VOCAT
takes into account the impact of family
violence on making a timely application,
even where it does not find that a relationship of power, trust or influence
existed. This
approach is similar to that employed in the Northern Territory
legislation, which requires the decision maker to specifically consider
‘whether the injury or death occurred as a result of sexual assault,
domestic violence or child abuse’.
8.49 Christine Forster supports this latter approach
because she does not think that the rationales for time limits apply in
the context of family violence.
8.50 According to Forster, there are three reasons for imposing time limits.
The first is that time limits are in the interests of
fairness, certainty and
public policy.
She argues, however, that there is
nothing fair or beneficial about obstructing victims of family violence in being
able to apply
for assistance.
8.51 The second reason is that it can be difficult to obtain evidence after a
long period of time has elapsed.
But, as Forster
points out, this does not apply to family violence, where the most relevant
evidence is usually from the parties themselves
due to family violence so often
occurring in an environment of secrecy.
8.52 The third reason for time limits is to prevent plaintiffs from
‘sleeping on their rights’.
However, as explained above, there are many reasons why victims of family
violence may not pursue redress in a timely fashion. This
is partly due to the
fact that unlike ‘stranger crimes’, the cultural norms that surround
family violence ‘do not
wholeheartedly condemn it as an unacceptable
social behaviour’.
8.53 Based on these arguments, Forster writes that ‘an explicit
exception such as that adopted by the Northern Territory seems
beneficial option’.
8.54 There is another option: remove time limits completely for victims of
family violence.
In the New South Wales legislation, there is no time limit for a person to

application for financial assistance if they are the primary victim of a
sexual offence committed against them when they were under

8.55 There are similar reasons for victims of child sexual abuse and victims
of family violence making delayed applications for assistance,
feelings of shame, fear of retribution, and failure to understand what has
happened to them.
Therefore, there
may be good reason to adopt New South Wales’ approach to victims of
family violence in
8.56 The Commission seeks the views of victims, persons affected,
professionals, stakeholders and the community on these issues and
relation to the form of the application and the time limit for bringing an
application to better accommodate victims of
family violence. Specific questions
are set out below.
Form of application
the VOCAT application form present difficulties for victims of family violence?
If so, how should these difficulties be addressed?
Timing of application
different time limits apply to family violence applications in recognition of
the dynamics of family violence? If yes, what

family violence be included as a factor the Tribunal must have regard to in
determining whether to hear and determine an application

9. VOCAT hearings—notification,
appearance and open court provisions
Introduction
9.1 This chapter gives an overview of the procedure in the Victims of Crime
Tribunal (VOCAT) hearings.
9.2 It relates to the third matter in the terms of reference, which asks the
Victorian Law Reform Commission (the Commission) to consider
the requirement to
notify a perpetrator, especially where the matter has not been reported to
police, or no charges have been
laid, or the prosecution discontinued or the person is acquitted.
9.3 This chapter also provides information in relation to general
procedure, appearances, open hearings, VOCAT’s capacity
to determine an
application without a hearing and alternative evidentiary arrangements.
9.4 This chapter then discusses the ways that VOCAT procedure, especially
notification of the alleged perpetrator, can have a negative
impact on victims
of family violence.
9.5 Aspects of the VOCAT procedure can act as a disincentive for victims of
family violence to make an application, may re-traumatise
victims and can result
in inconsistencies in the awards granted.
9.6 This chapter concludes by providing options for reform to improve access
and safety for victims of family violence, and poses
questions for
consideration.
Notification to interested persons
9.7 Under the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act),
VOCAT may give notice of the time and place for a hearing to any other person
whom it considers to have a
‘legitimate interest’ in the matter.
This can include the alleged perpetrator.
9.8 The Act also provides that VOCAT must not notify the alleged
perpetrator or an interested third party without first providing
the applicant
an opportunity to be heard on whether or not they should be
9.9 The process for notifying an alleged perpetrator or interested third
party is set out in
Practice Direction No.4 of 2008: Notification of Alleged
Offenders and Third Parties
. The Practice Direction uses the phrase
‘legitimate or substantial interest’, while the Act uses the term
‘legitimate
interest’ in the notification provision. This is most
likely because the provision of the Act dealing with persons who are
entitled to
make an appearance at VOCAT refers to those with a ‘substantial
interest’, rather than ‘legitimate
interest’. It is unclear
whether there is any substantial distinction between these terms. For
consistency
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
with the Act, this chapter will only refer to ‘legitimate
interest’ in the context of notification and ‘substantial
interest’ in the context of entitlement to appear.
9.10 In relation to the notification of alleged perpetrators, the Practice
Direction provides that VOCAT must advise the applicant
in writing that such
notification is being considered and allow 21 days for the applicant to
At the conclusion of 21 days, the tribunal
member will make a decision on whether the alleged perpetrator is to be notified

9.11 If the tribunal member decides to notify the alleged perpetrator, the
applicant has 21 days to decide whether she or he still
wishes to pursue their
application.
If the application proceeds, the
registrar will send notification of the application to the alleged perpetrator.
The alleged perpetrator
then has 14 days to advise the registrar as to whether
she or he intends to participate in the hearing.
9.12 The same process applies for third parties other than the alleged
perpetrator who VOCAT
identifies as having a legitimate interest in the
9.13 In addition, persons who consider that they have a legitimate
interest in an application for assistance, including the
alleged perpetrator,
can apply to VOCAT to be notified of the proceedings.
The application must be made in writing and must set out why they
consider that they have a legitimate interest or should be notified
proceedings.
9.14 Unless otherwise ordered by a tribunal member, the application by the
third party will be forwarded to the applicant, who then
has 21 days to respond
to VOCAT as to whether she or he objects to the third party or the alleged
perpetrator participating in the
proceeding.
9.15 If the applicant does not oppose the application or VOCAT receives no
response, it will be determined by a tribunal member in

the matter will be referred to a tribunal member for listing advice and there
may be a directions
Persons entitled to appear
9.16 In addition to the applicant, persons who are entitled to appear and be
heard by VOCAT
on the hearing of the matter are:

application for assistance, including

• an officer of VOCAT
or a legal practitioner assisting VOCAT

9.17 A person or body who is entitled to appear and be heard by VOCAT is

They may also appear by another

Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
9.19 On the hearing of a matter, VOCAT is not required to conduct itself in a
formal manner.
The Act does provide, however, that VOCAT has a duty to act fairly,
expeditiously
(promptly) and according to the substantial merits of the
9.20 VOCAT must give a party to the matter a reasonable opportunity to call
or give evidence, examine, cross-examine or re-examine
witnesses and to make
submissions.
Nevertheless, the decision of Justice McDonald of the Supreme Court of
Victoria in
AB v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
indicates that the duty to give a party a
reasonable opportunity to call evidence can be tempered by concern for the
wellbeing of
the applicant. In that case, the alleged perpetrator, the
applicant’s father, had been joined
as a party to the proceedings. He wished to call the applicant’s mother
as a witness but the mother expressed concern that her
daughter might self-harm
or commit suicide if the mother were to give evidence. VOCAT excused the mother
from giving evidence, ruling
that ‘the risks of self-harm [were] too
The applicant’s father appealed
VOCAT’s decision to the Supreme Court.
9.21 In dismissing the appeal, Justice McDonald stated:
I am satisfied that there are credible arguments in support of the Tribunal
having the power to excuse a witness from giving evidence
in circumstances where
such evidence could result in an applicant committing an act of self-harm,
including suicide.
9.22 Further special arrangements for vulnerable victims and witnesses are
discussed in more detail below.
9.23 VOCAT is also not bound by the rules of evidence, and may inform itself
in relation to the matter in any manner that it thinks
9.24 Section 39 of the Act gives VOCAT broad investigative powers. VOCAT is
able to authorise a member of staff, a legal practitioner
or a person appearing
on behalf of the state to make any enquiry or carry out any investigation that
it requires. VOCAT can also
order a medical or counselling report to be prepared
or submitted and it can order the applicant to provide any document VOCAT may
9.25 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that VOCAT makes
frequent requests for further documentation, especially
in family violence
matters where the
alleged perpetrator has not been charged or convicted, or the applicant has
provided little corroborating evidence.
9.26 Under the Act, VOCAT also has the power to issue a warrant for the
arrest of a witness who has been served with a summons to
attend VOCAT but has
failed to do so.
Alternative evidentiary arrangements
9.27 VOCAT is able to direct that alternative arrangements be made for
the giving of evidence by a witness.
This may be
done on its own initiative or on the application of a party to a
proceeding.

interest to do so.

9.37 Preliminary consultations undertaken by the Commission indicated that in
practice, this often functions as a two-step process
in which the applicant will
first ask VOCAT to determine their application without a hearing and, if they
are unhappy with the outcome,
they will subsequently request a hearing. In this
sense, the process under section 33
seems to resemble an offer of settlement in the course of civil proceedings,
but one that comes from the deciding authority itself.

rarely notifies perpetrators and that it is ‘always

potential discomfort and additional distress caused to applicants in the
relatively few matters where an alleged offender
is notified of an
application’.
However, the Royal Commission

above, VOCAT excused the mother from giving evidence out of concern for the
wellbeing of the applicant. (See [9.20].)
BFK v Victims of Crime Assistance
the applicant made a claim to VOCAT in
relation to an alleged rape by a former boyfriend. The alleged perpetrator was
notified of
the proceedings and later provided evidence in the form of a written
statement and oral evidence at the Victorian Civil and Administrative
(VCAT) hearing. VCAT took his evidence into account in deciding that the
Tribunal was no longer able to make a fair decision
on the matter due to the
applicant’s delay in making an application and, therefore, held that the
application should be struck
9.43 These cases show that alleged perpetrators are sometimes notified and do
participate in proceedings, even in the highly vulnerable
context of family
violence and sexual assault.
9.44 The Commission heard during preliminary consultations that a perpetrator
is more likely to be notified when the applicant has
not reported the incident
to the police or charges have not been laid against the alleged perpetrator,
when they have been acquitted,
or when there is little evidence to support an
applicant’s claim.
9.45 Reporting rates, prosecution rates and conviction rates are low in cases
of family violence.
Furthermore, as family violence
tends to occur in private, there is often
little corroborating evidence beyond that of the applicant and the
perpetrator.
These factors may lead to victims of
family violence being more susceptible to the perpetrator notification
procedure, despite its
potential to be highly
9.46 In addition, preliminary consultations identified that even if
perpetrator notification occurs rarely, the fact that it exists
at all can be a
deterrent for victims of family violence.
Evidentiary protections
9.47 As noted above, VOCAT has the power to close the court, restrict
publication of material, and permit alternative evidentiary
procedures, in order
to protect vulnerable applicants.
9.48 However, the Royal Commission was informed that these evidentiary and
procedural protections do not go far enough. The Magistrates’
Children’s Court noted in their submission that ‘the specific ...
provisions that protect sexual assault complainants
and protected witnesses in
criminal proceedings and intervention order matters do not explicitly extend to
VOCAT hearings’.
9.49 For example, the Courts identified that unlike the
Criminal Procedure
(Vic) and the
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
Act does not specifically prohibit a victim of a sexual offence being personally
cross-examined by the offender, or explicitly
require questioning to be
appropriately constrained.
In addition, in contrast
Criminal Procedure Act 2009
(Vic) and the
Family Violence
Protection Act 2008
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act) does not
contain any explicit protections for the giving of evidence by child applicants
and witnesses.
9.50 The Act gives VOCAT the discretion to put in place these
kinds of evidentiary protections.
During preliminary consultations the Commission heard that they are used in
family violence matters. However, the fact that these kinds of procedure are
not explicitly incorporated into the Act may mean that
such protections are
underused or used inconsistently.

Determination without hearing
9.51 The procedure under section 33 of the Act, which enables VOCAT to
determine an application ‘on the papers’, can be
a beneficial way
for victims to have their applications determined quickly and without having to
attend court. ‘Section 33
determinations’ also present a way for
victims of family violence to avoid the alleged perpetrator participating in the
and any concerns they may have about giving evidence.
9.52 However, in its submission to the Royal Commission, Women’s Legal
Service Victoria expressed concern that there may be
inconsistency in outcomes
for victims whose applications are decided on the papers and those whose
applications are determined at
9.53 Preliminary consultations undertaken by the Commission also disclosed
that awards granted at a hearing tended to be for larger
amounts than those
awarded pursuant to a section 33 determination.
9.54 These issues may be a disincentive for victims of family violence to ask
for their application to be determined without a hearing,
despite the potential
benefits that this process can offer them.
Discussion and options for reform
9.55 The areas that are most in need of reform in relation to procedure, as
identified by the Royal Commission, are the perpetrator
notification provision
and the evidentiary and procedural protections for vulnerable witnesses. This
section discusses options for
reform in these two areas.
Alleged perpetrator notification
9.56 In their submission to the Royal Commission, the Magistrates’ and
Children’s Courts recommended that ‘section
34 (alleged perpetrator
notification) operat[e] appropriately having regard to the specific safety risks
which commonly arise in
applications involving family
9.57 This could be achieved by removing the notification provision, either
entirely or specifically for vulnerable victims, such as
family violence victims
and, in particular child victims of family violence.
9.58 There were differences of opinion in the preliminary consultations with
key stakeholders as to whether or not removing the perpetrator
notification
provision would raise procedural fairness concerns.
9.59 Some stakeholders considered that notifying the alleged perpetrator
serves little purpose in the context of the Act, as the outcome
proceeding does not affect the rights and interests of an alleged perpetrator.
This view is consistent with the victim-
centred approach of the VOCAT process,
as described by Justice McDonald in
AB v Victims of Crime Assistance
9.60 Other stakeholders, however, considered that it was important for the
purposes of procedural fairness that persons are notified
of an application
being made which contains serious allegations against them and which could
result in serious findings being made
against them.
9.61 Another option is to amend the Act to explicitly list the safety
concerns associated with family violence as a factor to which
VOCAT must have
regard when considering whether

to notify an alleged perpetrator. This could result in fewer notifications
being made in the context of family violence.
9.62 A third option is to improve the evidentiary and procedural protections
for victims of family violence. This option is discussed
Evidentiary and procedural protections
9.63 The Magistrates’ and Children’s Courts recommended to the
Royal Commission that the Act replicate the procedural
and evidentiary
protections in place in the
Criminal Procedure Act 2009
(Vic) and the
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
(Vic) for vulnerable
9.64 This would involve extending explicit protections, such as, in relation
to sexual offences, prohibiting the alleged perpetrator
from cross-examining the
applicant and preventing inappropriate questions being asked of the
9.65 It would also entail ensuring that there are specific protections for
child victims. For example, like the
Criminal Procedure Act 2009
Victims of Crime Assistance Act
(Vic) (the Act) could explicitly prohibit the cross-examination
of a child victim of a sexual offence.
Moreover, in
considering whether or not a child should give evidence the Act could take a
similar approach to the
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
require VOCAT to have regard to the desirability of protecting children from
unnecessary exposure to the court system and
the harm that could occur to the
child and to family relationships if a child gives
9.66 This option for reform would ensure greater consistency in the kinds of
evidentiary and procedural protections that VOCAT provides
for victims who are
particularly vulnerable.
9.67 Additionally or alternatively, the Act could be amended to include an
overarching principle that guides the procedure of VOCAT
9.68 In its
Victims of Crime in the Criminal Trial Process Report
the Commission made a recommendation regarding
Procedure Act 2009
(Vic) which relates to witnesses in criminal
proceedings:
Criminal Procedure Act 2009
(Vic) should be amended to include a
guiding principle that, in interpreting and applying
, courts are to
have regard to the
fact that measures should be taken that limit, to the fullest practical
extent, the trauma, intimidation and distress suffered by
victims when giving
9.69 A similar principle regarding VOCAT procedure could be incorporated into
the Act. The Act could be amended to include a guiding
principle that in
determining the procedure of hearings and the giving of evidence, VOCAT is to
have regard to the fact that measures
should be taken that limit the trauma,
intimidation and distress suffered by victims when giving or hearing
9.70 The Commission seeks the views of victims, persons affected,
professionals, stakeholders and the community on what changes should
the Act to help ensure VOCAT processes more appropriately address the needs of
family violence victims at the same time
as ensuring procedural fairness.
Specific questions for consideration are set out below.

10. Making an award
Introduction
10.1 This chapter outlines the circumstances in which the Victims of Crime
Assistance Tribunal (VOCAT) may make an award for financial
assistance. More
specifically, this chapter considers:
• when VOCAT must refuse to make an award of
matters the
Tribunal must have regard to in determining whether or not to make an award or
the amount of assistance to
10.2 This chapter relates to the
fourth matter identified in the terms of reference, which asks the Victorian Law
Reform Commission
(the Commission) to review the matters giving rise to refusal
of an application for financial assistance except in special circumstances.
10.3 The matters VOCAT must have regard to in determining whether to make an
award, and the amount of an award, are outlined in
sections 52
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act). Broadly, these
sections require VOCAT to consider a victim’s character and behaviour
before, during and after
a crime. These matters may be unrelated to the act of
violence itself.
10.4 In examining the matters VOCAT must have regard to, this chapter
considers why these provisions of the Act might disproportionately
victims of family violence as compared to other victims of crime, discusses
options for reform and poses questions for consideration.
When can an award be made?
10.5 VOCAT may award financial assistance to a victim of crime where it is
satisfied that an
act of violence occurred, that the applicant is a victim of that act of
violence, and that the applicant is eligible to receive the
assistance.
10.6 It is not a requirement of the Act that someone needs to have been
charged with or convicted of an offence for an award to be
10.7 However, even if VOCAT determines that a victim is eligible for an
award, the Act requires that in some circumstances VOCAT must
nevertheless
refuse to make an award of assistance. These circumstances are set out in
section 52 of the Act and are discussed further
10.8 In addition, section 54 of the Act requires that in determining whether
to make an award of assistance, or the amount of assistance
to award, the
tribunal must consider a number
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
of additional specified factors.
circumstances and considerations are discussed in this chapter.
10.9 There are good policy reasons for inclusion of these considerations in
the Act. They enable VOCAT to refuse to make an award
where it would be
inconsistent with the purpose and objectives of the Act. For example, applicants
who have been convicted of violent
crimes may not be appropriate recipients of
assistance which is a symbolic expression by the
state of the community’s sympathy.
10.10 The Magistrates’ Court of Victoria in its submission to the
Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence (the Royal
Commission) has
stated that these provisions allow VOCAT to balance competing factors when
making a decision about financial assistance.
However, the Magistrates’
Court of Victoria also acknowledges that the provisions in the Act do not
provide adequate guidance
these factors should be considered.
The effect of
this is considered below with reference to specific provisions under sections
52, 53 and 54.
Mandatory refusal of an award under section 52 of the Act
10.11 Under section 52 of the Act there are two circumstances where VOCAT
must, without exception, refuse to make an award of assistance:
satisfied the application has been made in collusion with the perpetrator of the
act of violence
if an earlier
application for assistance has been made by the applicant from the same act of
10.12 There are two further
circumstances where the Tribunal must refuse to make an award of assistance,
unless there are ‘special
circumstances’:
satisfied that an act of violence was not reported to police within a reasonable
satisfied that the applicant failed to provide reasonable assistance to any
person or body engaged in the investigation,
arrest or prosecution of the
perpetrator (the investigatory or prosecutorial
10.13 Section 52 of the Act
therefore provides an exception to mandatory refusal where the Tribunal
considers that there are special
circumstances resulting in either a failure to
report to police within reasonable time, or failure to provide reasonable
to police or prosecution. Each of these two circumstances is
considered further in this part.
Act of violence not reported to police within a reasonable time
10.14 In determining whether an act of violence was reported to police within
a reasonable time, section 53 provides that VOCAT may
‘have regard to any
matters that it considers relevant’.
• the age of the victim at the time of the act of violence
• whether the victim has an intellectual disability, within the meaning
6 Ibid s 54
example, in
Larson v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
[2012] VCAT
(6 August 2012), the applicant had a significant criminal history with
prior convictions for violent offences including murder, armed
robbery and
reckless conduct endangering life as well as prior convictions for dishonesty,
property and driving offences. VOCAT refused
an award for assistance on the
basis of his criminal history, which was upheld on appeal to

Court of Victoria, Submission No 978 to Royal Commission into Family Violence,

• whether the victim has a mental illness, within the meaning of the
Mental Health Act
whether the
perpetrator was in a position of power, influence or trust in relation to the
• whether the victim was threatened or intimidated by
the perpetrator
• the nature of the victim’s
10.15 The concept of ‘within a reasonable time’ has also been the
subject of judicial consideration by the Victorian Civil
and Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT). These cases, discussed below, demonstrate the complexity of the
decision making required under
sections 52 and 53 of the Act.
What is considered a reasonable time for reporting to police?
FG v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT overturned VOCAT’s
decision, ruling that the victim’s VOCAT application should not have been
refused under section
52 for failure to report within a reasonable time. VCAT
found that the victim’s significant delay in reporting to police was
reasonable in the circumstances. In that case, the applicant alleged she had
been repeatedly sexually abused by her grandfather between
of five and 10. In considering whether the applicant’s failure to
report was ‘reasonable’ under section 52, VCAT
determined that it
was not reasonable for the victim to report the abuse while her grandfather was
alive because of the family dynamics.
VCAT also accepted that it ‘would
have been futile to make a report to the police after his
10.17 Similarly in
J v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT held that a delay of
approximately 35 years in reporting alleged sexual abuse to police was
reasonable given the circumstances
of the case. In that case, VCAT considered
the way sexual assault was viewed at the time of the offences and the power
dynamics in
the family relationship. VCAT noted ‘[the perpetrator] was an
adult member of the family and a teacher. In that position he
was more ...
likely to be believed over the Applicant’.
recognises here that victims who experience family violence as a child face
additional barriers to reporting crimes.
10.18 Family violence dynamics were also considered in the case of
Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal.
applicant alleged she was raped by her husband in mid-1971 and continued to be a
victim of sexual and physical abuse throughout
their marriage until it ended in
divorce in 1982. In 2001, the applicant applied for financial assistance from
VOCAT, at which time
VOCAT advised her to report the incidents to police.
Accordingly, the applicant reported the incidents to police. However, police
discouraged the applicant from taking the matter any further and the
applicant’s claim for financial assistance was rejected
by VOCAT. Grounds
for rejecting the application included for not reporting
within reasonable time under section 52 of the Act. On appeal to VCAT, VCAT
found that the applicant’s report to police did
occur within
‘reasonable’ time given the nature and dynamics of the
relationship:
The explanation for absence of complaint by her in relation to the initial
rape is one which I accept and is probably all too common.
She was aged 17 at
the time and frightened of the reaction of her parents and others. Thereafter,
she was fearful for her wellbeing,
and that of her son, of whom the offender is
the father ... I accept her evidence concerning the fear which she experienced
the marriage and its ongoing legacy ...

[2002] VCAT 1390
(21 October 2002).
10.19 All three cases described above involved circumstances of family
violence and in all cases, the circumstances of family violence
considered by VCAT as creating an exception to mandatory refusal on the basis of
‘special circumstances’.
VCAT considered what a reasonable time period for reporting was in the
context of the circumstances of the act of violence, the nature
and dynamics of
the relationship and the vulnerability of the victim.
10.20 However, in
S v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT affirmed the decision of VOCAT to
refuse an application on the grounds of, among other things, not reporting to
police within
a reasonable time under section 52. The applicant had not reported
alleged rape to police until 22 years after the alleged offence occurred. The
victim was 17 years old at the time of the alleged offence.
In considering the
additional factors outlined in section 53, VCAT determined the applicant had not
reported the alleged rape to
police within a reasonable time, noting the victim
was not threatened or intimidated by the alleged offenders, having only been
10.21 The decision in
S v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
narrower interpretation of section 53, requiring actual threats or intimidation
to mitigate ‘unreasonable’ reporting
time. In that case, neither
VOCAT, nor VCAT on appeal, appeared to give weight to other reasons why a victim
of rape might not report
the matter to police, including the victim’s age
at the time of the offence. This was despite the victim’s admission
she did not report to police at the time because she did not know what to do,
was frightened and ashamed, felt dirty and was
scared of the
perpetrators.
10.22 The implications of these cases for victims of family violence are
discussed further below.
When do special circumstances mitigate an ‘unreasonable delay’ in
reporting to police?
10.23 Even where VOCAT may determine that a report was not made to police
within a reasonable time, section 52 of the Act enables
the Tribunal to consider
any special circumstances that may have brought about that delay.
CS v Victims of Crime Assistance
the applicant alleged historical sexual
abuse by a number of members of her immediate and extended family. The acts of
violence commenced
in approximately 1936 and took place over a period of years
the victim was between four and 14 years of age. While VOCAT refused the
application because the acts of violence were not reported
to police within a
reasonable time, VCAT determined that special circumstances mitigated the delay
in reporting, including the applicant’s
age at the time of the abuse and
the failure of others to whom she reported the abuse (such as a psychologist) to
convince her to
report the abuse to police.
10.25 However, in
TUN v Victims of Crime Assistance
VOCAT refused an application for
assistance on the basis of section 52, as the applicant had not made a report to
police. The application
related to an alleged assault and threat to kill by the
applicant’s former de facto partner.
10.26 VOCAT found that no special circumstances existed to justify the lack
of reporting to police, particularly as the victim had
applied for an
intervention order. On appeal to VCAT it was submitted on behalf of the
applicant that a report had not been made
to police because of special
circumstances, namely that her former partner was a member of a motorcycle gang
with seven convictions
for manslaughter, an acquaintance had been killed after
making a statement to police regarding her former partner who was

[2002] VCAT 1390
(21 October

circumstances exist, it is probably not necessary
to go to that argument as the
reporting to the police was done within a reasonable time if
53 is applied’ at [24].

also a member of a motorcycle gang, and because she did not consider applying
for an intervention order as being the same as making
a report to police. VOCAT
had determined that such factors did not constitute special circumstances,
instead holding that such factors
‘... were nothing out of the ordinary or
special; it was common for such victims to fear
reprisals’.
10.27 On appeal, VCAT found that special circumstances did exist in this
case. The applicant was still anxious and distressed about
the possibility of
reprisal and was still genuinely fearful
of the alleged offender. VCAT did, however, distinguish the applicant’s
experience from
‘others faced with domestic violence’, indicating special
circumstances existed in this case because of the criminal profile
of her former
partner and because of ‘what she knows happened to others involved with
members of bikie gangs, when they went
Failure to provide reasonable assistance to an investigatory or
prosecutorial body
10.28 As noted above, except where there are ‘special
circumstances’, failure to provide reasonable assistance to an
investigatory
or prosecutorial body requires VOCAT to refuse an application for
financial assistance.
10.29 Unlike the ‘failure to report’ provisions, the Act does not
provide guidance about what the Tribunal may have regard
to in considering
whether there are ‘special circumstances’. In addition, the phrase
‘special circumstances’
is not defined in the Act.
10.30 However, the question of what constitutes ‘special
circumstances’ has been judicially considered. In
Nichol v Victims of
Crime Assistance Tribunal
VCAT found that for
the purposes of section 52, special circumstances must be something ‘out
of the ordinary’.
As already noted, the extent to which family violence may, or may not, be
‘out of the ordinary’ for the purposes of section
What is failing to provide ‘reasonable assistance’?
10.31 Under section 52 of the Act, there are no prescribed positive actions a
victim must undertake to satisfy ‘reasonable assistance’,
providing a witness statement or participating in a criminal trial. However,
guidance in the VOCAT application form states:
In most cases, calling the police to attend the scene of a crime is not
enough. You should make a formal report, including a sworn
statement (if
requested), so the police can fully investigate the matter. You should give the
Tribunal full details of the relevant
police officer’s station, rank and
registration number.
10.32 Due to the nature and dynamics of family violence, many victims of
family violence may withdraw assistance from police investigations
prosecutions, including not making a statement after calling
Victims of family violence may fear the
perpetrator or they may have reconciled with their partner after the violent
incident. Victims
of family violence may also have a distrust of police or other
authority figures, or may fear the consequences of a successful prosecution

[10]. In making this submission to VCAT, counsel for VOCAT was referencing
VCAT’s previous decision in
Nichol v Victims of Crime Assistance
[2000] VCAT 840
, in which it had held that for the purposes of s
52, what must be demonstrated for ‘special circumstances’ is
‘out of the ordinary’.

in the initial stages of their investigation, the day before the hearing she

complaint, she had not rendered reasonable assistance for the
purposes of
section 52 of the Act. Accordingly, VCAT refused the application noting

In particular, it was submitted that the
applicant’s decision to withdraw her complaint was motivated by a concern
for the welfare
of the perpetrator and his need for assistance in relation to

assistance to police and prosecution were not
brought about by any sort of
special circumstance.
10.37 However, in
Rajah v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT found the existence
of special circumstances to mitigate what might otherwise be viewed as
failure to assist the police. In that case the applicant was
a victim of sexual
and physical abuse by her mother’s former de facto husband and the
circumstances of the offending and the
vulnerability of the victim were accepted
as giving rise to special circumstances:
In my opinion, the applicant’s failure to ... furnish the police with a
written statement— is explicable by reference
to her psychological state,
her shame and her fear of the perpetrator ... I consider that the nature of the
abuse, the high degree
of vulnerability of the victim, her age, the
consequential shame and embarrassment she experienced, the concern for her
wellbeing and for her own, constitute special
circumstances.

Character, behaviour and attitude of applicant
10.40 Section 54 of the Act requires VOCAT to have regard to the character,
behaviour and attitude of an applicant in determining
whether or not to make an
award or the amount of assistance to award. This provision is broad, and
includes considering the applicant’s
character, behaviour and attitude
before, during or after the act of violence. The Act specifically includes a
requirement for consideration

Victorian female criminal offenders had experienced family
10.42 The nexus between victimisation and criminal activity in the family
violence context has been attributed to the social and economic
disadvantages
experienced by family violence victims. However, this nexus may also be a result
of the coercive behaviour exercised
by an abusive partner which can lead to
forced criminal behaviour.
In addition, as emphasised
by the Royal Commission, there is a connection between children who experience
family violence and offending

of judicial consideration and is explored further below,

Similarly, in
TNX v Victims of
Crime Assistance Tribunal
VCAT considered the
applicant’s prior convictions for causing serious injuries, failing to
render assistance and the limited
remorse shown
by the applicant. Taking into account all those circumstances, VCAT
determined it was appropriate to reduce the special financial
available from $10,000 to $8500.
10.45 These decisions by VCAT demonstrate that a victim’s eligibility
for financial assistance is not solely based on the act
of violence. Broad
discretionary factors, including community expectations—that is, whether a
victim is an appropriate recipient
of ‘sympathy’ by
the community—will inform decision making. Some academics have also
suggested that victims must demonstrate they are exhibiting
behaviours typically
associated with
‘responsible citizenship’.
Rajah v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT accepted that the applicant
a victim of sexual and physical abuse by her mother’s former partner
from three years of age. The applicant later abused drugs
and had a significant
criminal record, mostly related to her abuse of drugs and alcohol. Despite this
criminal record, VCAT determined
that the applicant’s criminal history
should not preclude her from receiving financial assistance:
I accept that the applicant was a victim of assaults, sexual and otherwise in
early years and that, in all probability, the sexual
assaults have resulted in
her subsequent dysfunctional behaviour which has exhibited itself in the forms
of drug and alcohol abuse
and related criminal
activities.
10.47 The decision in
Rajah v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
indicates that in some
cases an applicant’s past criminal behaviour may be viewed within a
broader context of disadvantage and family violence victimisation.
10.48 However, in
MK v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT declined to award the applicant
special financial assistance because she had failed to report to Centrelink that
she was in a
de facto relationship with her partner, whom she reported was
abusive. The applicant’s financial instability was described
applicant as part of the perpetrator’s abuse:
MK said that at the time she had no real alternative but to continue to live
in the home
... She said the partner was blackmailing her in the sense that she was in
receipt of the disability pension and had not advised
Centrelink she was in a de
facto relationship. According to her, the Partner threatened to report her,
saying that given her previous
convictions, she could go to
10.49 The applicant’s decision not to report the de facto relationship
to Centrelink were looked upon unfavourably by VCAT under
considerations, notwithstanding her vulnerability, financial insecurity and the
alleged abusive relationship.
‘Provocation’ and condition or disposition of the applicant
which may have contributed to injury
10.50 In determining whether to award financial assistance or the amount to
award, section 54 of the Act requires VOCAT to consider
whether the applicant
provoked the act of violence and if so, the extent to which the act of violence
was in proportion to that provocation.
Section 54 of the Act also requires VOCAT to consider any condition or
disposition of the

These are sometimes referred to as
‘contributory conduct’ or ‘provocation’
10.51 ‘Contributory conduct’ clauses such as those included in
section 54 of the Act have been criticised by academics
as inviting
‘victim blaming’. In particular, in family violence cases, defensive
actions by victims can sometimes be
misconstrued as ‘provocation’
‘contributing to injury’.
10.52 A demonstration of the applicability of these provisions can be found
in the non-family violence case of
Fallon v Victims of Crime Assistance
where VCAT affirmed VOCAT’s
decision to deny the applicant assistance due to provocation:
There is no doubt in my mind that the inflammatory words uttered by Ms Fallon
set in motion the chain of events ... There was no need
for her to ... address
her in such an aggressive and abusive manner. In my view she invited
retaliation. Her behaviour was provocative
and entirely out of proportion with
the circumstances.

not provoke the assault by her then boyfriend:
she did not start or provoke the fight that led to the assault. It started on
the tram after her boyfriend, who was drunk, snatched
her wallet and took some
money from it. When he refused to return the money, she tried to get it back.
There ensued a heated verbal
argument which became physical, in which he kicked
and punched her and she hit him while trying to defend
10.56 VCAT ultimately determined that although the applicant may have
provoked the assault, it was outweighed by the actions of the
perpetrator. VCAT
made the following observations:
I consider that any provocation by Ms Mendez is outweighed by the role of
her assailant in following her on more than one tram journey
when she was trying
to get away from him, in refusing to leave a tram when asked by her to do so, in
taking money from
her immediately prior to the assault, and in brutally retaliating when she
attempted to wrest that money back from him. I note that
the assailant was
charged, inter alia, with intentionally causing serious injury, and that Ms
Mendez was not charged with any offence
arising from the

Victims of Crime Assistance Act
10.58 In its submission to the Commission’s reference in relation to
victims of crime in the criminal trial process, the Australian
Commission submitted that victims’ compensation claims should not be
excluded on the basis that the offender might
benefit, as such provisions
unfairly disadvantage victims of family violence.
10.59 In the Australian Law Reform Commission and New South Wales Law Reform
Commission report
Family Violence—A National Legal Response: Final
, the Commissions stated that exclusion in circumstances such as this
‘has the effect of excluding most victims of family
violence—especially
where the victim continues to reside with the
offender—and fails to take into account the fact the compensation award
used to leave the offender’.
10.60 The ALRC indicated that other measures should be adopted to ensure
offenders do not have access to victims’ compensation
awards rather than
restricting a victim’s access to financial assistance. This included
legislative mechanisms to make payments
on the basis of expenses incurred, which
is already provided for under the Act in Victoria.
10.61 The Commission has not found VOCAT appeal decisions on this point.
However, some stakeholders and academics have raised concerns.
Meyering has
stated that the section
54 relationship clauses disproportionately impact family violence victims,
who for a variety of reasons may choose to remain with,
or return to, their
abusive partners.
Concerns have also been raised
cohabitation has been held
to be sufficient to make an inference that an award
would benefit a perpetrator, given such a relationship would be a ‘sharing
relationship’.
10.62 The Royal Commission was informed by the Magistrates’ and
Children’s Court of Victoria that the requirements of
sections 52, 53 and
54, including consideration of whether the perpetrator will benefit, are often
relevant in family violence applications:
There are many examples of how these sections may become relevant. A victim
may call 000 for police to attend at the time of an incident,
but then be
unwilling or unable to go on to make a formal police statement about the crime.
She may make a formal
statement, but later withdraw it. She may not support the police in their
application for a full intervention order, with the result
that only a
“basic” order can be made to promote her safety. In cases where she
has cooperated fully with investigating
authorities and
the perpetrator has been found guilty, she may nevertheless have reconciled
with the offender; will he now benefit from an
10.63 Similarly, in a submission to the Australian Law Reform Commission and
New South Wales Law Reform joint report on family violence,
Domestic Violence
Victoria and others expressed concerns that excluding claims on the basis that
the perpetrator may benefit fail
to reflect the nature and dynamics of family
violence, given financial circumstances are a critical factor in women’s
relationship.

Effect of VOCAT considerations under sections 52, 53 and 54
10.64 Sections 52, 53 and 54 of the Act require VOCAT to consider the ways a
victim behaves before, during and after a crime. These
sections require VOCAT to
make judgments about a victim’s behaviour in:
their everyday
life, including potential and/or past criminal activity and drug and alcohol

• choosing to provide assistance, or not provide assistance, to police
and prosecution

10.65 The Magistrates’ and
Children’s Court of Victoria have highlighted that the requirements of
sections 52, 53 and
54 are often relevant in family violence VOCAT applications
because of the power dynamics involved in family violence. The cycle
of violence
may involve numerous reconciliations before a relationship
10.66 The Royal Commission was informed of the complex circumstances in which
a victim of family violence might involve investigatory
or prosecutorial
agencies in a family violence situation, only to later withdraw from the process
or resume a relationship with the
perpetrator.
if a victim was to cooperate fully throughout a civil and criminal process, by
the time an application is before VOCAT the victim
may have reconciled with the
offender and the offender may arguably benefit from an award of assistance.
These circumstances are
all directly relevant to the considerations of VOCAT
required under sections 52, 53 and 54 of the Act.
10.67 Despite the additional factors specified in section 53 of the Act, and
judicial consideration of these matters, concerns continue
to be raised by
advocacy organisations and
academics that the reporting provisions unfairly disadvantage victims of
family violence who, in general, are less likely to report
10.68 Preliminary consultations undertaken by the Commission indicated that
the terminology of these provisions, in particular that
‘[t]he Tribunal
must refuse to make an award’ creates perceived barriers to VOCAT
applications. That is, despite the
discretion that may be exercised by VOCAT,
the legislative drafting creates an assumption of refusal which influences a
perception of whether their application will be granted, even if
their actions may be ‘reasonable’ or the circumstances
10.69 The Commission also heard that some lawyers consider cases with
‘mandatory refusal’ issues to be untenable, even
before VOCAT
considers there are issues with an application. The question of how specific
provisions of the Act might disproportionately
impact victims of family violence
is discussed in more detail below.

victims will wait until the alleged offender has moved away,

will relate to the community’s historical experience

Australia’s National
Research Organisation for Women’s Safety (ANROWS) states that many

as potentially being financially dependent on the
perpetrator.
10.76 The Commission heard during preliminary consultations that additional
barriers to reporting exist for women living in rural
and regional communities,
as well as for Aboriginal women.
10.77 Key legal and victim support stakeholders have
previously raised concerns about section
52, describing it as complex and problematic because of the lack of guidance

10.78 The case law discussed above offers differing interpretations of what
might be considered
‘reasonable’ in the context of family violence. In some cases,
the circumstances of
family violence gave rise to findings that the lack of reporting was
reasonable given the circumstances. In other cases, such behaviour
considered ‘unreasonable’ but falls under special circumstances.
Consequently, there is little available evidence
indicating a nuanced,
consistent approach to consideration of additional barriers to reporting for
family violence victims. In addition,
there appears little consideration of the
different cohorts of family violence victims who encounter double disadvantage,
women living in rural
and regional communities, Aboriginal women, victims with a disability and
people from
LGBTIQ communities.
10.79 As discussed earlier in this chapter, the case law also indicates that
refusing to cooperate with a criminal prosecution will
be looked upon
unfavourably by VOCAT. However, this characteristic is particularly relevant to
the circumstances of family violence.
of family violence may not assist police or the prosecution because of their
fear of the perpetrator or because they are still in
a relationship with them or
because they rely financially on the perpetrator.
Lack of guidance in the Act regarding the dynamics of family violence
10.80 By requiring the Tribunal to consider whether the alleged offender
is in a position of power, influence or trust, or whether
the victim was
threatened or intimidated by the alleged offender, section 53 of the Act
provides VOCAT with some limited
guidance applicable to the characteristics of family
However, family violence is not
articulated as a specific factor VOCAT may have regard to in making these
determinations.
10.81 Some academics have suggested that the additional considerations
provided in section
53 go some way to reducing the subjectivity involved in determining an award,
although they may not ‘go far enough to acknowledge
the systemic barriers
to women reporting violence to or cooperating with
10.82 Key legal and victim support stakeholders have raised similar concerns
consider under sections
52 and 53 of the Act.
10.83 The Act does not provide guidance on recognising the unique
characteristics of family violence, or direct VOCAT to have regard
characteristics and dynamics. This means sections 52, 53 and 54 of the Act may
be inconsistently interpreted and applied.
10.84 In some cases the circumstances of family violence are viewed as
creating ‘reasonable’ responses by victims with
respect to their
delay in reporting or lack of assistance to police or prosecution. However,
other cases find such responses ‘unreasonable’,
but invoke the
‘special circumstances’ provision. While these differing approaches
unfairly disadvantage individual victims of crime, they raise questions about
how the Act conceptualises family violence.

Failure to acknowledge police and community attitudes to reports of family
10.86 In addition to failing to recognise the nature and dynamics of
family violence, the Act may also fail to account for police
and broader
community attitudes to family violence and the way in which these attitudes
might affect reporting rates.
10.87 For some victims, family violence offences may have occurred years ago,
when police and prosecutorial bodies did not respond
to family violence as a
crime. The Royal Commission was told that prior to around 2001, police and the
broader community responded
to family violence as a private
Family violence was ignored or minimised. For
those who were brave enough to report it, they were often dismissed or
discouraged from
pursuing the matter any further.
10.88 The mandatory refusal provisions, in particular the police reporting
requirement, may therefore not adequately recognise the
fact that police
attitudes to family violence can still be problematic. During the Royal
Commission, Victoria Police acknowledged
that responses to family violence can
still be a ‘lottery’ for some victims.
This is despite considerable efforts to change police and community
10.89 Furthermore, during preliminary consultations, the Commission heard
that some women had attempted to report matters to police
but had not been
‘allowed’ to make a report. This was particularly relevant for
historical abuse or when family violence
was no longer occurring. The Commission
also heard that even where reports might be made to police, a report may not
always be recorded
as an incident. This then limits the documentation available
for a VOCAT application, making applications more complex for lawyers
and for VOCAT to assess.

not confident the system will deliver the kind of justice

10.92 Research indicates there may be a strong link between family violence
victimisation
and criminal offending, particularly for female victims of family
In particular, Aboriginal women in prison
have experienced high levels of victimisation:
Very often, women and children who have been victims of violence have
self-medicated their mental health and trauma with drugs and
alcohol which
inevitably results in adding to the chaos of their lives and increases their
10.93 The Royal Commission has found that women might commit crimes as a
result of experiencing family violence or under duress or
coercion from a
violent partner
and that women in prison in Victoria
have experienced family violence at much higher rates than women in the rest of
the community.
10.94 Given these findings, it is suggested that consideration of a
victim’s character and behaviour under section 54 of the
Act might have a
disproportionately adverse impact for victims of family violence as compared to
other victims of crime. VOCAT and
VCAT findings appear to show differing
considerations of character and behaviour in family violence contexts and as
such, it is not
clear whether a family violence ‘lens’ is applied to
offending behaviour.
‘Contributory conduct’ provisions
10.95 The case of
Mendez v Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal
discussed above illustrates the complexity of applying the contributory
conduct provision under section 54 of the Act. In that case,
the complexity was
evident when the victim was considered by both VOCAT and VCAT to have
‘provoked’ the assault by her
boyfriend, even though VCAT
subsequently found that the actions of her boyfriend ‘outweighed’
her provocation.
10.96 While the Commission has not found other case law indicating that
victims of family violence are disproportionately disadvantaged
section 54 contributory conduct provisions, some academics have raised concerns,
noting the potential for ‘victim
blaming’ particularly in the
context of family violence.
10.97 In this context it is noted that concerns about contributory conduct
clauses were also raised by domestic violence advocacy
organisations during a
Western Australian review of family and domestic violence
However, the Law Reform Commission of Western
Australia (LRCWA) was unable to find evidence that contributory conduct
clauses disproportionately affected victims of family violence.
Notwithstanding this lack of evidence, given the issues raised by
organisations, the LRCWA recommended a review of how Western Australia’s
compensation scheme affected victims of
family and domestic
10.98 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that there may
be circumstances where victims are charged with criminal
offences as a result of
defensive actions taken against perpetrators. The Royal Commission was told by
key stakeholders that police
sometimes inaccurately identify victims as
‘primary aggressors’ when attending family violence incidents, and
women who use violence in self-defence are identified by police as the
primary aggressor.
Where a victim of intimate
partner violence has retaliated against violence by her partner, police can
sometimes arrest both parties,

10.99 The Commission raises this issue as relevant to the character and
conduct provisions under section 54 of the Act, as there may
be circumstances
where a victim of family violence applies to VOCAT for an award of assistance,
but police records indicate ‘equal
‘provocation’, based on police records.
10.100 The potential impacts of these complexities and considerations under
section 54 of the
Act in family violence contexts merit further exploration.
Potential for perpetrator to benefit from award of assistance
10.101 A lack of financial security and economic resources may be barriers to
leaving abusive relationships.
A victim of family
violence may be unable to leave a relationship without the financial assistance
of a VOCAT award. However, at the
time the application is assessed, the victim
may still be residing with the perpetrator. This may raise issues of perpetrator
10.102 As noted earlier, the Commission is unable to determine whether the
perpetrator benefit provisions are currently disproportionately
victims of family violence in Victoria. However, the Commission notes the
academic and stakeholder concerns about these
provisions, including those of the
Magistrates’ Court of Victoria in its submission to the Royal
Commission.
10.103 Further examination of the practical interpretation of this provision
is required. Further exploration is also required of
how this might be
determined by VOCAT. For example, if a victim of family violence has reconciled
and is living with a perpetrator
of family violence who is undertaking a
court-mandated men’s behaviour change program,
would an award be refused or reduced by virtue of their shared living
arrangements and shared finances? And if so, is this appropriate
purposes and objectives of the Act?
Experiences in other jurisdictions
Report to police within a reasonable time
10.104 Most Australian state and territory financial assistance schemes for
victims of crime
require a victim to report to police within a ‘reasonable
Aside from the evidentiary benefits
for supporting compensation or financial assistance claims, such provisions also
encourage victims
to come forward to enable the state to prosecute
10.105 As in Victoria, other state and territory legislative frameworks
allow the relevant decision- making body to consider factors
that may have
resulted in failure to report within a reasonable time. For example, the
Northern Territory provisions are similar
in Victoria.
In South Australia the court cannot
make a compensation order if the applicant failed to report the offence
‘without good reason’.
10.106 However, in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital
Territory, an
act of violence can be reported to other professionals, including government
agencies and health professionals such as a counsellor,

Furthermore, in 2017, the
Queensland Parliament passed an amendment to its legislation which will
explicitly extend its alternative
reporting provision to victims
of domestic violence and recognise victims who report the violence to
‘domestic violence services’.
Requirement to assist police
10.107 As already noted, most Australian state and territory schemes require
victims to assist police and prosecution. However, unlike
Victoria, where a
victim must establish ‘special circumstances’ if they have not
provided reasonable assistance, Queensland
has recently amended its
victims’ of crime assistance legislation to enable the government assessor
to have regard to whether
the act of violence involves domestic
This will make Queensland the only

reasonably assisted police and prosecution.
Contributory conduct and character of victim
10.108 In all Australian jurisdictions, there is some form of
‘contributory conduct’ clause in the relevant
legislation.
Broadly, all states and territories
examine the victim’s conduct before and at the time of the act of violence
and consider
whether their conduct may have contributed to their injuries or
whether they took steps to mitigate the extent of their
10.109 The United Kingdom has a more prescriptive approach than in
Australian states and territories, refusing awards or reducing
awards where
applicants have an unspent conviction, calculated on a sliding scale. For
example, a 10 per cent reduction is applied
for unspent convictions of one
penalty point, moving up to a 100 per cent reduction for unspent convictions of
10 penalty points.
Discussion and options for reform
More certainty and equity for victims of family violence
10.110 Women’s Legal Service Victoria has submitted there is
inconsistency in decision making in VOCAT on family violence
matters, causing
victims of family violence to feel confused and traumatised by the legal
10.111 The Commission’s previous report in relation to victims of crime
highlighted stakeholder proposals for section 52 to
be amended to list family
violence as a relevant factor to which VOCAT could have regard in exercising its
discretion.
In particular, Victoria Legal Aid has
suggested that section 52 should explicitly require consideration of the
of the relationship between the victim and offender. Women’s Legal
Service Victoria suggested that the phrase ‘special
circumstances’
should be expressly defined in section
52 to recognise family violence.

Recognising family violence under
sections 52
10.114 As the above discussion indicates, the Act provides little legislative
guidance to enable
VOCAT to exercise discretion in a consistent way when considering factors
under sections
52, 53 and 54 with respect to victims of family violence.
10.115 Recognising family violence for the purposes of sections 52, 53 and 54
under the Act could be achieved in different ways.
10.116 Legislative amendment could involve creating an overarching provision
which enables, or requires, VOCAT to consider the nature
and dynamics of family
violence when making
a determination under sections 52, 53 and 54 of the Act. Alternatively,
family violence matters could be exempted entirely from the
mandatory refusal
requirements under section 52 and from some, or all, of the section 54
considerations.
10.117 Another option is for the Act to be amended to explicitly require
consideration of family violence when determining what is
‘reasonable’ as a subsection of section 52. This is
the approach taken most recently in Queensland with respect to whether a
victim has provided reasonable assistance to police or prosecution.
could also be amended to require VOCAT to have regard to family violence in
considering whether there are special circumstances
for the purposes of section
10.118 The Act could also be amended to include family violence specifically
in the circumstances VOCAT may have regard to under section
53. Consideration
could also be given to extending the application of section 53 to consideration
of whether the applicant provided
reasonable assistance to police and
prosecution under section 52(a)(ii).
10.119 An additional option is to amend section 52(a) to enable victims of
family violence to report the act of violence to other
bodies or agencies. This
could be instead of,
or in addition to, reporting to police. In this context, consideration could
be given to recognising reports made to other identified
people such as
counsellors, support workers or other health
professionals.
10.120 Alternative reporting mechanisms exist in New South Wales, the
Australian Capital
Territory and Queensland in certain circumstances, such as where victims are
considered a
‘special class’ of victim.

the making of awards
Introduction
11.1 This chapter outlines the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal (VOCAT)
procedures and time frames relevant to the making of an
award for financial
assistance, including interim awards. Consideration is given to the impact of
these procedures and time frames
on whether an award of financial assistance can
be made to victims of family violence.
11.2 This chapter relates to the fifth matter identified in the terms
of reference, which requires the Victorian Law Reform
Commission (the
Commission) to review procedural matters to expedite the making of an award.
11.3 This chapter then:
considers how
VOCAT’s procedures and time frames might affect victims of family violence
differently to other victims of crime
poses a number
of questions for consideration and suggests options for reform to improve victim
experiences of VOCAT, including proposals
to improve delivery of awards.
VOCAT processes and time frames
11.4 As discussed in Chapter 8, VOCAT applications commence by way of a
written application in the prescribed form
accompanied by documentary evidence.
11.5 If the applicant has not reported the act of violence to the police, the
form must be accompanied by a statutory declaration
by the applicant setting out
the circumstances of the act of violence and the reasons the matter was not
The investigation process
11.6 VOCAT has broad investigative powers under the
Victims of Crime
Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act). Under section 39, VOCAT may:
• authorise a person to make any enquiry or carry out any investigation
on behalf of the
Tribunal necessary to furnish the Tribunal with the further
information it requires
preparation and submission to the Tribunal of a medical report or counselling
order a VOCAT
applicant to lodge with the Tribunal, within a specified period, an additional
statement containing particulars of matters
specified in the order or any
documents specified in the order.

11.7 In practice, the following process is usually followed by VOCAT after it
receives an application. The Tribunal sends the applicant
a ‘Directions
for Preparation’ form outlining the evidence the Tribunal will need to
make a determination. This may include
requests for:
• a report from the applicant’s treating doctor if physical
injury is claimed
• receipts or invoices for the expenses claimed
• a copy of the applicant’s police statement
• copies of any intervention orders
• a report from the counsellor if the applicant is seeking
counselling
• information about Medicare rebates.
11.8 When requesting this information, VOCAT provides a date for filing all
supporting material.
Usually VOCAT requires all
supporting material to be filed within four months of the application being

crime occurred, as well as the criminal history of
the alleged offender and the
victim. It also seeks information about a victim’s injuries via medical
records or from Victoria
Process for determining an award
11.10 After receiving documentation from the applicant and relevant parties,
a directions
hearing may be required to provide guidance to the Tribunal about matters
relevant to the application. It is more common to request
applicant’s lawyer attend a directions hearing than the
11.11 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that the use of
directions hearings by VOCAT members varied, including
in the amount and
particulars of the information requested and the purpose of the directions

directions hearing or a final hearing. This depends on the preference
applicant as well as the Tribunal’s need for a
11.13 Once VOCAT has the information it requires to make a decision, the
Tribunal advises the applicant whether a hearing will be
held. Matters that
proceed to a hearing are usually those where a victim has asked for the
application to be determined by a hearing,
or where VOCAT considers the matters
to be complex and requiring the giving of evidence and oral submissions by
lawyers. Around 25
per cent of VOCAT matters are currently determined at
11.14 In practice, many straightforward applications are decided without the
need for a hearing.
However, as stated above, more
complex cases are usually determined at a hearing and VOCAT has previously
identified family violence
applications as complex.
The time frame for decision making
11.15 VOCAT must act ‘expeditiously’ (that is, promptly) to
determine applications. Under the Act, VOCAT has a duty to
act fairly, according
to the substantial merits of the case and as promptly as the requirements of the
Act and a proper determination

11.16 However, VOCAT must also have regard to matters that can sometimes
affect the time it takes to finalise an application, including:
• awaiting the outcome of a criminal investigation, trial or
• the need for further enquiries to be made by the Tribunal
the need to
notify the alleged offender about the application and provide reasonable time
for the offender to respond
• waiting for an injury to
stabilise so that an accurate prognosis can be provided to the
additional time to identify and communicate with all related victims of a
deceased primary victim to advise them of their
right to apply for financial
assistance.
11.17 The Act specifically
enables VOCAT to make awards even where there might be related civil or
Sentencing Act 1991
(Vic) matters that have not yet been finalised. Under
32(3), the Tribunal is not prevented from hearing and determining a VOCAT
application only because there is a civil proceeding, or
a proceeding under
subdivision (1) of Division 2 of
Sentencing Act 1991
11.18 This means that VOCAT can still decide on the result of an application,
even if there is going to be a civil trial, or if a
court is going to decide a
matter concerning compensation or restitution under the
Sentencing Act 1991
(Vic). However, VOCAT can adjourn considering an application if
The Tribunal may adjourn the consideration

to that act of violence, and the trial is likely to be

generally will be adjourned until related matters in
the civil and criminal
courts have been decided. Applicants are advised that the Tribunal may wait

weeks of a VOCAT member deciding to conduct it or, if
requested by the
applicant, within six to 10 weeks of the applicant filing all supporting
11.21 However, the Commission heard during preliminary consultations that
where there are criminal proceedings pending, the practice
of the Tribunal is
to order an adjournment.
Interim awards for urgent assistance
11.22 Section 56 of the Act empowers the Tribunal to make an interim award of
assistance pending the final determination of an application.
11.23 Applicants who need urgent assistance, such as financial assistance for
safety-related expenses, can seek an interim award.
This award can often be paid
before VOCAT makes a final determination.
11.24 Interim awards form part of the total financial assistance available
for expenses incurred, or likely to occur, up to the statutory
limit of $60,000,
and must be deducted from the total amount of any assistance

impede a victim’s ability
to leave an abusive relationship and obtain
Financial challenges are particularly acute
at the point of separation, when expenses may be incurred for health, housing,
and legal assistance.
What is the current time frame for VOCAT awards?
11.27 VOCAT has implemented a number of initiatives to improve timeliness,
including launching an online application form and setting
up an electronic case
management system.
The use of judicial registrars is
also designed to save time by reserving the use of magistrates for more complex

nine months.
VOCAT’s website states that after an award of financial assistance is
made, it can take up to six weeks for the payment to be
11.29 The Commission is not aware of whether interim awards are ‘fast
tracked’, or are subject to the same payment process
and time frame.
However, the Commission notes concerns raised with the Victorian Royal
Commission into Family Violence (the Royal
Commission) that even interim awards
experience delays.
The Royal Commission was advised
that although family violence services operating in some magistrates’
courts have adopted procedures
to make interim awards for urgent expenses
related to security, relocation
or medical bills, the administrative processes still result in payments
taking a number of weeks, limiting their
usefulness.
11.30 Preliminary consultations conducted by the Commission also indicated
that the interim award process was not producing timely
responses for victims of
family violence. Some stakeholders stated that where family violence
circumstances are urgent, they no longer
seek assistance through VOCAT as VOCAT
delays affect client safety and do not assist with time-sensitive matters such
as security
or relocation.
Increasing complexity
11.31 Despite the efficiencies being implemented by VOCAT, the Tribunal has
observed an increase in the complexity of applications,
particularly relating to
family violence. As VOCAT notes, ‘Applications for assistance for family
violence offences are complex
continue to rise in number’.
Magistrate has also stated that applications arising from family violence
require additional sensitivity and ‘intense
management’.

Annual Report
11.32 In the 2015–16 reporting period, there was a 12 per cent increase
from the previous financial year in the number of matters
proceeding to hearing
rather than being determined ‘on the papers’.
This supports VOCAT’s observation of an increase in complexity of
the applications being brought before it, as hearings are
more likely to be
required when matters are complex.
11.33 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that increased
complexity affects the Tribunal’s timeliness because
more information is
required. The perpetrator may need to be notified and a directions hearing may
be required. The Tribunal may
also ultimately decide a hearing is necessary to
determine the matter.
Other urgent financial assistance for victims of family violence
11.34 As discussed above, other criminal compensation or civil restitution
avenues are unlikely to be a viable option for many victims
11.35 However, as noted in Chapter 4, Victoria’s broader family
violence service system provides access to some state-funded
assistance that is comparable to some aspects of financial assistance provided
to victims of crime under the Act. Most
notably this includes assistance
available under family violence flexible support packages (FSPs).
11.36 Some aspects of FSPs overlap with the assistance available through
VOCAT, although the way a victim accesses assistance is different.

with urgent and critical support tailored to their specific

11.40 FSPs are intended to
assist victims to stabilise and improve their safety in a crisis or
post-crisis situation. In this respect, there are parallels with
VOCAT’s awards of financial assistance for safety-related expenses.
However, the case management framework for provision of FSPs requires case
managers to identify the ways in which the package will
support the long-term
health and wellbeing of the victim.
11.41 Support workers have emphasised the importance of FSPs to enabling a
timely response:
‘Without the [flexible support] package we could not have achieved
[relocation] in such a short time frame. This woman was with
us for a month and
we worked quickly to get this application
11.42 As FSPs are administered by community agencies via a case management
approach, and agencies are not bound by rules of evidence
like VOCAT, packages
can be approved in approximately 14 days.
11.43 During preliminary consultations, support agencies highlighted the
importance of a timely and flexible response for victims
in crisis. FSPs were
described as more responsive than interim awards under VOCAT. Indeed, some
services advised that they were directing
their clients away from VOCAT and
towards the use of FSPs for urgent assistance.
Timeliness of awards in other jurisdictions—a comparison
New South Wales
11.44 Other jurisdictions have also encountered barriers to providing timely
and responsive support and financial assistance for victims
of crime, including
victims of family violence. This section examines the recent experience of New
South Wales, which resulted in
the reform of its victim support and compensation
scheme in 2013.
11.45 An independent review in 2012 found that the objectives of
Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996
(NSW) —to provide support
and rehabilitation to victims of violent crime through counselling and
compensation—were not
being met. This was due to the significant delays in
the provision of compensation, with an average wait of over two
The system was described as
‘complicated’ and requiring expert medical reports and lawyers to
pursue claims.
11.46 The reviewers noted that providing practical assistance shortly after a
person experienced an act of violence would better assist
victims to begin their
healing process.
In particular, the benefits of early
provision of funding for relocation assistance, security upgrades and assistance
with medical
expenses were noted.
11.47 The Victims Compensation Scheme was replaced in 2013 by a new Victims
Support Scheme (VSS) designed to provide more tailored,
timely and integrated
victim support and compensation through the one scheme:
The VSS does not focus on specific injuries sustained by victims, but looks
holistically at the impact of a violent crime on victims’
whole. The VSS focuses on providing victims with practical and financial
assistance when they need it most. The new VSS
has reduced the amount of lump
sum payments previously available ... and instead focuses

determination was
too long. It estimated the waiting period to be frequently between nine and
11.51 Research conducted by Women’s Legal Service Victoria similarly
found that victims of family violence experienced long
waits for VOCAT matters
to be finalised:
The current scheme does not adequately meet the needs of women who have
experienced family violence. Women who would benefit enormously
from payments of
compensation—those left in financial hardship by family
violence—have limited access to the scheme.
11.52 Furthermore, Women’s Legal Service Victoria noted that awards of
special financial assistance are only made as part of
the final VOCAT
determination, meaning special financial assistance in the form of a lump sum
payment is rarely available when a
victim is most financially
vulnerable.
11.53 In preliminary consultations the Commission was told that some VOCAT
applications by family violence victims could take 18 months
to two years to be
determined.
The Commission also heard that some family violence victims did not receive a
final determination until four years after the initial
application.
11.54 The Commission notes VOCAT statistics indicating almost half of all
applications are finalised within nine months.
possible that the complexities experienced in family violence cases are leading
to the increased delays in the average time
taken to complete an application in
these matters.
11.55 Delays in determining VOCAT applications relating to family violence
can have profound impacts on victims of family violence.
Financial hardship can
be a significant consequence of family violence, and the economic impacts of
family violence can also impede
a victim’s ability to leave an abusive
relationship and obtain safety.

in assisting women who are in financial hardship after
fleeing family violence,
in particular noting the importance of timely payments:
If the payment is timely, it may have a role in preventing entrenched
poverty. Such a payment may assist with a rental bond for a
new home, basic
furniture, appliances or clothes that are needed after leaving the former family
Discussion and options for reform
Delays entrenching economic disadvantage
11.57 This section of the consultation paper considers options for
• to streamline the process for victims of family violence
• to clarify VOCAT processes and obligations under the Act to reduce
• to improve consistency in practice.
11.58 This section also considers possible benefits of specialisation and
integration of financial assistance with the victim support
11.59 One of the objectives of the Act is to assist victims of crime to
recover from the effects of violent crime. However, delays
in accessing
financial assistance can potentially re- traumatise victims and in some cases,
further entrench economic disadvantage
when victims are most vulnerable.
11.60 Interim awards are designed to provide timely access to financial
assistance, including for family violence victims. However,
it is not clear
these benefits are being realised for victims of family violence who urgently
need financial assistance.
11.61 In preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that victims of
family violence need swifter access to interim awards and
earlier access to
final determinations, including special financial assistance. One victim of
family violence represented in the
Women’s Legal Service Victoria’s
research report asked whether there could be a ‘fast track’ for
of family violence applying to VOCAT.
The cost of lawyers
11.62 VOCAT is not required to conduct itself in a formal manner and is not
bound by rules or practice of evidence like a court.
However, the VOCAT process remains inherently a legal process bound by
the provisions and procedures of the Act. This requires the
involvement of
lawyers and magistrates and the collection of evidence and submission of
supporting documents.
11.63 The Victims Support Agency has reflected that ‘whilst VOCAT was
established to provide resources to assist victims to
recover from the effects
of crime, it is not part of the victim service system, but an integral part of
the legal system. VOCAT is
therefore bound to follow legal rules and procedures
in assessing claims and making awards.’
11.64 In 2015–2016, VOCAT awarded legal costs (associated with VOCAT
applications) totalling
$5,095,278, an average of around $1000 per awarded applicant, demonstrating
the high legal costs associated with the application
These legal processes take time, can be
costly and may be too onerous or overwhelming for many victims of family
violence. This may
be particularly the case when a victim might be at crisis
point fleeing from violence, relocating or have sole caring responsibilities

Annual Report
Lack of connection with the service system
11.65 The fact that VOCAT is a separate process—not part of a
specialist family violence response or a case management process—is
further barrier to timeliness and accessibility for victims. Some victims may
simply be unaware of VOCAT’s existence,
which also impacts on the ability to provide timely assistance. Awareness of
the scheme is further discussed in Chapter 13.
Family violence ‘triaging’
11.66 One possible solution for improving timeliness for family violence
VOCAT applications is to implement an administrative ‘triage’
function in the VOCAT registry to assess and prioritise family violence
applications.
11.67 This initiative would require additional funding and a specialist
family violence
coordination team. Given the importance of integrated support for family
violence victims, it may require a case management approach
that provides
linkages and referrals to other specialist services.
Practice Direction—expedite the making of an award even where
related matters not finalised
11.68 Preliminary consultations indicated that VOCAT awards are almost always
delayed pending finalisation of related criminal matters.
11.69 One proposal is to develop a Practice Direction, consistent with
sections 32 and 41 of the Act, which provides more guidance
expediting family violence VOCAT applications is preferable. For example, a
Practice Direction might provide a clearer
presumption of expediting a VOCAT
application when family violence circumstances exist and additional criteria are
met. Although
the Act already provides scope for this, the provisions in
sections 32 and 41 create ambiguity about the circumstances where applications
should be determined despite other related matters pending.
Family violence VOCAT list or specialist ‘stream’
11.70 Another option involves the creation of a separate VOCAT family
violence list, similar
to the VOCAT Koori List. This would create a different VOCAT environment for
VOCAT applications arising from family violence. Like
the VOCAT Koori List, it
could adopt a case management approach and triage urgent matters more
effectively in a specialist environment.
11.71 The intention of the Tribunal in developing the VOCAT Koori List was to
develop procedures to ensure that the purposes and objectives
of the Act could
be achieved in relation to Koori applicants. VOCAT relied on the procedural
flexibility and the informality afforded
to it under the Act to respond with
maximum flexibility to the
particular circumstances of a Koori applicant.
VOCAT Koori List is a management initiative introduced by the Tribunal and it
does not involve applying any different legal considerations
determination of applications for assistance. All applications for financial
assistance are considered and determined within
the legislative framework of the
Act. However, the VOCAT Koori List enables the Tribunal to be more responsive
the circumstances of Koori victims of crime who may otherwise have found it
difficult to engage with the system.
11.72 Specialisation would bring the benefits of increased collective
knowledge and expertise into family violence VOCAT matters.
It would ensure
those dealing with the complexity of these matters are familiar with the needs
of family violence victims and the
nature and dynamics of family violence. The
experience of the VOCAT Koori List was that specialisation increased cultural
and sensitivity to Koori issues.
56 Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal,
Koori VOCAT List Pilot, Review
and Recommendations
57 Ibid 10.
11.73 A separate family violence list might also result in swifter final
determinations, limiting delays between interim and final
awards being made.
Earlier access to the types of award made in final determinations might better
meet the needs of this particular
cohort of victims experiencing significant
financial hardship as part of their experience of family violence.
11.74 Separate VOCAT streams have been previously proposed for other victim
groups, including survivors of institutional child abuse.
During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that the
introduction of specialist streams has significantly changed victim
experiences
in other courts, pointing to a radical shift in culture and attitude. Ian
Freckelton has observed that victim compensation
schemes are complex and should
be recognised as specialised areas of practice.
Appointing VOCAT-only magistrates
11.75 Given the increased complexity in matters coming before
consideration could be given to appointing
VOCAT-only magistrates. This would increase specialisation across all VOCAT
matters—including
family violence—but would not require the
infrastructure of a specialist family violence list or stream.
11.76 The courts have previously highlighted the benefits of specially
trained and assigned magistrates, in the management of family
Having specially trained and assigned magistrates has strengthened ... the
management of family violence matters. [These] magistrates
... have undergone
specialist professional development to increase their understanding of the
dynamics of family violence and ...
tend to become increasingly familiar with
relevant issues and able to deal efficiently with
Administrative models
11.77 Consideration could be given to possible benefits of administrative
models where commissioners or government assessors make
determinations, such as
in Queensland,
the Northern Territory, Tasmania, Western Australia, New South Wales and the
Capital Territory.
11.78 Further research is required to assess whether these schemes result in
outcomes or timelier decision making for victims. It is also important to
consider whether these schemes provide the same victim experience
in terms of
judicial validation and acknowledgment. These matters are further discussed in
Chapter 14.
Hearing VOCAT matters during other civil and criminal hearings
11.79 Magistrates in the Family Violence Court Division have the ability to
determine VOCAT
matters at the same time as dealing with other civil or criminal family
violence matters.
11.80 A proposal could be to extend this power to all magistrates, regardless
of whether it is a specialist court location. This would
enable a magistrate
hearing a family violence intervention order matter or a family violence-related
criminal matter—such as
a breach of a family violence intervention
order—to make an interim VOCAT award to support the recovery of the
victim. As the
Act already enables awards to be varied and
there is scope for further consideration

11.81 Given all magistrates are also VOCAT members, this would not pose
issues of lack of knowledge or awareness of the Act. However,
it does move away
from suggestions made at [11.70] – [11.74] for increased specialisation.
This option might increase the number
of awards for family violence victims, but
may not necessarily improve consistency in awards, given there would not be
specialisation.
Complementing other state-funded financial assistance
11.82 In preliminary consultations, the Commission heard of the more flexible
financial assistance options now available for victims
of family violence,
specifically through FSPs.
11.83 Consideration may need to be given to improving the connections between
VOCAT and specialist family violence organisations which
provide state-funded
financial assistance
in other ways. A specialist family violence worker could be located within
VOCAT as a support coordinator. This coordinator could
make initial assessments
of the specific needs of a family violence applicant and their urgency, and
triage cases to reduce delays
and negative impacts. Some applications for
interim awards via VOCAT may be better suited to other state-funded support,
FSPs. Later on, victims could apply to VOCAT for non-urgent financial
assistance or special financial assistance.
11.84 A specialist family violence worker could liaise with family violence
services and legal services to increase community knowledge
and awareness of
VOCAT and other assistance available to meet the needs of family violence
victims in various ways.
Incorporating financial assistance with other victim support
11.85 The integrated financial assistance and victim support model introduced
in New South Wales in 2013 has substantially improved
the timeliness of
assistance provided to victims of crime. However, concerns have been raised that
there are few victims of domestic
violence and sexual assault accessing
financial support under the scheme.
The New South
Wales government is currently reviewing the Act.
11.86 Further exploration is needed of how VOCAT complements specialist
family violence support and other victim support programs
such as the Victims
Assistance Program (VAP), and whether VAP and VOCAT could be more
integrated.
11.87 It is valuable to consider to how the provision of interim awards could
be improved by adopting the administrative and case
management processes used in
making other awards of assistance, such as family violence FSPs.
11.88 The Commission raises all of these options to prompt stakeholder
consideration of the various ways in which timeliness could
be improved. Some
proposals could be implemented on their own, while others might be complementary
or reliant on other proposals.
11.89 The Commission seeks the views of victims, persons affected,
professionals, stakeholders and the community on these issues and
options for
reform. Questions are set out below.

12. Review, variation and refund of awards
Introduction
12.1 This chapter discusses the process for review of awards of financial
assistance under the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act).
12.2 This chapter also discusses when the Victims of Crime Assistance
Tribunal (VOCAT) may vary an award or determine that an award
needs to be
refunded, and poses questions for consideration.
Review of Tribunal decisions
12.3 Any person whose ‘interests are affected’ can apply to the
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) for
review of a final VOCAT
Reviews may relate to:
• VOCAT refusing to make an award of assistance
• the amount of assistance awarded
• VOCAT refusing to vary an award
• the amount of assistance awarded when reviewing an award
• a decision that a person is required to make a refund to VOCAT
• the amount VOCAT determines must be
12.4 In practice, those affected by VOCAT decisions are usually applicants
and so reviews usually relate to VOCAT refusing to make
an award or the amount
of an award.
12.5 There are relatively few reviews, with only 11 applications for review
made to VCAT in the
2015–2016 financial year. In six of these matters, the application for
review was struck out, withdrawn or abandoned. In three
of these cases, the
original award was set aside and a new award made on
Variation of an award

assistance has been made can apply for a variation of

12.7 In considering an application for variation, VOCAT must have regard
• any fresh evidence
• any change of circumstances
• any other payments received by the applicant
• any other relevant factors.
12.8 The Tribunal must not vary an award if the application for variation is
made more than six years after the original award was
made, unless the applicant
was then under 18.
12.9 Case law indicates that the variation powers under section 60 are
Variations can be made in situations
‘where new evidence is forthcoming that enables an award to be made either
where no award
was made at all or at a higher rate than could have been made on
the material previously available’.
12.10 Although there is broad provision for variation, variations must still
be consistent with the Act. For example, an award for
‘other expenses
actually and reasonably incurred’ under section 83 must still assist a
victim’s recovery from the
act of violence.
the case of
Davis v Victims of Crime Assistance
VCAT noted the ‘numerous’
of assistance made to the victim by way of variation for counselling, medical
costs and education expenses.
12.11 In 2015–16, VOCAT varied 986 awards for expenses already incurred
and 588 for expenses not yet incurred.
12.12 In preliminary consultations the Victorian Law Reform Commission (the
Commission) heard that family violence victims frequently
require award
variations, particularly to pay for additional counselling.
Refund of awards
12.13 The Act enables VOCAT to require applicants to refund some or all of
the financial assistance awarded to them if they later
receive damages,
compensation, assistance or other payments of any kind for injuries suffered as
a result of a violent crime.
12.14 Limited data is available on how often refunds may be required.
VOCAT’s annual report does not state how often refunds
are required.
Effect of review, variation and refund of awards on family violence
12.15 Given the limited data available on refund of awards, the Commission
has not heard that these provisions adversely affect victims
of family violence.
Similarly, reviews of VOCAT awards are relatively rare (11 reviews in the
2015–2016 financial year).
12.16 However, provisions relating to variation of awards are of particular
significance to family violence victims’ experiences
of VOCAT. As the

Annual Report
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
Tamara was involved in a domestic violence assault in 2010 by her former
partner. The alleged offender would become violent when he
used drugs and
alcohol. The alleged offender would take all of Tamara’s money, leaving
her with no food or items to look after
herself or her children. She reported
the incidents to the police but did not want any further action taken as she was
of how the alleged offender would react. The Tribunal finalised her
application by awarding 24 sessions of counselling and $1300
financial assistance. She was also awarded $5500 for a vehicle to assist
her recovery and $1000 associated with the cost of a computer to assist her
in achieving her study goals. Tamara was granted a variation
of the award
approximately 6 months later to enable her and her children to go on a family
holiday in the amount of $1779. Based
on the material filed from Tamara’s
psychologist, the Tribunal was satisfied that the family’s recovery would
from time away to reconnect and strengthen their
bond as a family unit. Tamara recently sought a further variation so that she
can attend a course educating her on the effects of
Alcohol and Other Drugs
12.17 Tamara’s case study illustrates the flexibility of VOCAT in
providing additional awards as situations change or new needs
emerge. Variation
of awards acknowledges that a victim’s journey is not always predictable,
and needs may change over time.
12.18 However, the process of applying for a variation is not always smooth
for victims of family violence. The Commission heard in
preliminary
consultations that each variation requires the hiring of a solicitor and
evidence from professionals such as counsellors.
Most variations in family
violence matters relate to additional sessions required for counselling, where
the variation is required
for therapeutic purposes. It might be more practical
and beneficial if practitioners could provide more counselling sessions at
discretion, rather than victims having to re-engage lawyers to seek financial
assistance for more counselling.
12.19 Research by the Victims Support Agency in 2011 found that some victims
found the process of seeking variation of an award to
obtain further counselling
frustrating because it involves many visits to lawyers. One victim stated:
‘You want it to be over
and that dragged it on substantially longer ...
which is why I think a lot of people wouldn’t go through with
During preliminary consultations, the
Commission heard that the process was overly legalistic and burdensome, that
solicitors should
not need to be involved and that an administrative process
would be simpler.
Discussion and options for reform
12.20 Awards can be varied under equivalent legislation in most other
Australian states and territories. Often, a victim’s circumstances
have changed and variations must be sought within a specific time period,
although these time limits vary in each jurisdiction
and range from between
three to seven years.
12.21 Further research is required into the circumstances in which awards
are varied in the context of family violence, and the value
of variations in
addressing the specific needs of family violence victims. In addition, barriers
experienced by victims during the
variation process require further
exploration.
12.22 The Commission seeks information on family violence victims’
experiences of the VOCAT refund or review process. In addition,
the Commission
seeks the views of victims, persons affected, professionals, stakeholders and
the community on the following questions.

13. Awareness of VOCAT and accessibility
for family violence victims
Introduction
13.1 This chapter considers what proportion of victims of family
violence access the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal (VOCAT).
This analysis
explores the percentage of current VOCAT matters that relate to family violence.
It also contrasts the recorded incidents
of family violence in Victoria with the
number of VOCAT applications.
13.2 This analysis also seeks to ascertain how aware the community is of
how accessible VOCAT is to family violence victims. These are different
matters to the legislative barriers that may be encountered
after a victim
applies to VOCAT and which were examined in Part Two.
13.3 This chapter considers victims’ awareness of VOCAT, their
knowledge of the scheme and the extent to which access to the
supported by the broader family violence service and support system.
Consideration of these issues will enable the Victorian
Law Reform Commission
(the Commission) to seek that any proposed changes to the
Victims of Crime
Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act) are meaningfully implemented for victims
of family violence.
13.4 Finally, this chapter poses a number of questions for consideration.
VOCAT and family violence statistics
13.5 During preliminary consultations, the Commission was told that there
appeared to be relatively few VOCAT applications compared
to the number of
reported incidents of family violence in Victoria.
13.6 To understand whether victims of family violence are aware of VOCAT and
their eligibility to seek financial assistance under
the Act, the Commission has
attempted to assess
the percentage of VOCAT matters related to family violence, as well as the
percentage of family violence incidents reported to police
each year that might
flow through to applications to VOCAT.
13.7 As with many other aspects of data collection with respect to family
violence, it is
hard to find comprehensive, reliable data about the use of VOCAT by victims
of family violence.
The available data, which the
Commission has used below, has limitations. The Commission acknowledges these
limitations and also acknowledges
that some assumptions have been made in
interpreting the available data. These are also noted below.
1 The Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence discussed the
challenges of accurate data collection: Victoria, Royal Commission
Family Violence,
Summary and Recommendations
(2016) 47–8.
13.8 VOCAT data indicates that of the 6221 VOCAT applications lodged in
2015–16, 388 (6.2 per cent) were in relation to ‘family
However, family violence as a
category was not added to VOCAT’s case management system until part way
through the 2015–16
financial year and so not all family violence cases
for that period have been captured in the data. As such, this figure of 388 may
not be an accurate indication of the number of family violence applications
lodged annually with VOCAT.
13.9 Even if this figure is doubled to attempt to provide a more
representative annual figure, the number of family violence applications
still not account for more than 10–15 per cent of the VOCAT applications
lodged in the 2015–16 period. This figure
falls short of VOCAT’s
previous estimate that around a quarter of all applications involve family
However, given the data limitations, it is
difficult at this stage to definitively ascertain the percentage of VOCAT
matters that
relate to family violence.
13.10 Taking a broader view, Victoria’s Crime Statistics Agency reports
78,628 ‘family incidents’ being recorded
by Victoria Police in
A ‘family incident’ is an incident
where a Victoria Police Risk Assessment and Risk Management Report (also known
L17 form) is completed and recorded on Victoria Police’s database
Under Victoria Police’s
Code of Practice for the Investigation of Family Violence
, an L17 must
be completed for every family violence incident reported to
Therefore, ‘family incidents’ are
incidents of family violence recorded by Victoria Police, although not all such
involve criminal offences.
13.11 It is recognised that not all of the 78,628 family incidents recorded
by police would
fall within the scope of VOCAT.
However, the small
number of family violence-related VOCAT applications recorded for 2015–16
appears disproportionate to the
number of family violence incidents recorded by
police for the year.
Awareness of the Act
13.12 Awareness of compensation and state-funded assistance has been raised
as one of the most critical barriers to the effectiveness
of any financial
assistance or compensation scheme.
13.13 The Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence (the Royal
Commission) found that some victims were unaware of their eligibility

Victoria has recommended that any reform to the Act to improve accessibility
for victims of family violence must also be accompanied
by awareness raising, to
ensure family violence victims are aware of their entitlements under the
13.15 Similarly, research conducted by the Victims Support Agency in 2011
found a general lack of understanding of VOCAT and the process,
even among a
sample group of victims who had been through the VOCAT
Some participants were unaware of VOCAT as
a separate legal entity, referring to the process and assistance provided as
being provided
‘Victims of Crime’.
Many participants
in the Victims Support Agency research highlighted that they felt there was a
lack of public awareness of VOCAT
and that because of this, it was likely that
many victims would be missing out on assistance. Some described learning about
only ‘by chance’.
13.16 During preliminary consultations, the Commission was informed of
concerns about the lack of information about VOCAT in accessible
formats and
languages other than English. Some agencies were concerned that it did not seem
to be a core part of any agency’s
role to inform victims about VOCAT and
provide written information or referrals.
Understanding of the Act and access to VOCAT
13.17 The Act has been described as ‘complex and difficult for victims
to understand’.
A victim’s experience of
VOCAT is therefore likely to be enhanced by victim support and the availability
of legal representation.
13.18 VOCAT has emphasised its close links with support
However, these support mechanisms are not
integrated with VOCAT and so victims still have to access multiple services.
13.19 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that specialist
family violence services or Victims Assistance Program
(VAP) workers provide
support and information to help victims of family violence access VOCAT. The
Commission also heard that victims
of family violence are unlikely to contact or
navigate the VOCAT system without a lawyer. This was described as a barrier
some victims will not be able to access a lawyer. The Commission was
told that sometimes lawyers will not take on VOCAT-related work
because the
legal costs awarded are too low given the amount of work often required.
13.20 Research by the Victims Support Agency highlights concerns with the
legalistic nature of the VOCAT process. Some victims found
it difficult to
obtain a solicitor who would take on their VOCAT application, particularly in
regional areas, while others who could
find a solicitor found them difficult to
deal with, non-communicative, difficult to contact, dismissive, insensitive, and
only interested
13.21 The Commission was also informed during preliminary consultations that
although the VOCAT application form itself might be easy
enough to work through
and complete without legal support, the information that is then requested by
VOCAT can be overwhelming and
often requires legal representation.
13.22 Research has highlighted victim frustration with the system of referral
to VOCAT. This affects victims’ ability to access
VOCAT in a timely and

that victims of family violence experience frustration

‘multiple doors’ to access financial
Experience in other jurisdictions
13.23 In contrast to Victoria, some states and territories have combined
victim support and compensation/financial assistance schemes.
13.24 New South Wales has a Victim Support Scheme which incorporates
financial assistance and other aspects of victim support. Victims
are allocated
a support coordinator who develops a tailored plan to guide each victim through
the criminal justice and human services
system. Part of this care package may
include financial assistance for immediate needs and economic loss, and a
recognition payment.
Victims are advised that
do not need a lawyer as their allocated support coordinator will assist with
their claim and Victims Services can obtain police reports,
court papers and
medical records with a victim’s consent.
13.25 Similarly, in the Australian Capital Territory, Victim Support ACT
administers the financial assistance scheme as well as managing
and delivering
victim case management services. Clients registered for case management can
receive services such as assessment,
court support, advocacy and therapeutic

applications for financial assistance and the Victims of Crime Commissioner, the
head of Victim
Support ACT, is the final decision
Discussion and options for reform
13.26 It is not clear whether a substantial number of family violence victims
who might be potentially eligible for assistance under
the Act are aware of
VOCAT. Additional barriers such as difficulty obtaining legal representation and
lack of accessible information
might also be affecting victim awareness and the
number of victims who apply.
13.27 This issue is not unique or new. VOCAT’s Koori List was
introduced because VOCAT ascertained that while the Aboriginal
community was
disproportionately affected by violent crime, they were also not accessing the
assistance available through VOCAT at
a corresponding level.
13.28 The Commission is considering how aspects of the current system work
together, including VOCAT, lawyers, victim support and
family violence services,
and how better integration might improve knowledge about and accessibility of
the service for victims of
family violence.
13.29 The Commission raises these issues of awareness and accessibility to
determine whether changes to improve access for family
violence victims under
the Act might only be legislative in nature, or whether other changes to support
legislative reform might
also need to be considered.

professionals, stakeholders and the community on these issues
and options.
Specific questions for consideration are set out below.
do family violence victims learn about the availability of VOCAT? What is the
best way to inform victims of their potential eligibility
under the Act?
should information about VOCAT be made more accessible for victims of family
violence, including those speaking languages other
than English?
the VOCAT system easy to navigate without legal representation? If not, why? How
should the system be improved to make it more
accessible for victims of family
violence without legal representation?
victims of family violence find it difficult to secure legal representation? If
yes, why? How should this be remedied?
the provision of state-funded financial assistance under the Act be better
integrated with victim support services or specialist
family violence support?
If so, how should this be done?
learnings from the VOCAT Koori List might be able to be applied to improving
accessibility and knowledge of the scheme for victims

14. VOCAT—beyond financial assistance
for victims of family violence
Introduction
14.1 Financial assistance and compensation go beyond monetary benefits. They
can make a statement to the community about the unacceptability
violence and confirm the responsibility of the state for preventing violence
from occurring.
They can also recognise and validate a
victim’s experience by offering a symbolic expression by the state of the
community’s
sympathy and condolence for the significant adverse effects
they have experienced or suffered.
14.2 This chapter considers aspects of the
Victims of Crime
Assistance Act 1996
(Vic) (the Act) and the Victims of Crime Assistance
Tribunal (VOCAT) that go beyond providing financial assistance to victims of
The chapter considers the extent to which:
• the system acknowledges victims and recognises harm caused by family
• the Act recognises family violence
• the VOCAT process is trauma-informed
• the process is consistent and transparent
the rights of
perpetrators and victims are balanced, having regard to the purpose of the
Act—to assist victims of crime to recover.
14.3 As with
Chapter 13, consideration of these matters is not expressly required by the
terms of reference. However, the Victorian
Law Reform Commission (the
Commission) considers that these factors influence the way victims of family
violence engage with VOCAT.
14.4 Finally, this chapter poses a number of questions for consideration and
explores what reforms might be needed for the system
to better acknowledge and
recognise family violence, embed trauma-informed processes, improve its
consistency and transparency, and
appropriately balance perpetrator and victim
VOCAT as a therapeutic forum
Victim acknowledgment and recognising harm
14.5 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that one of
the potential benefits of Victoria’s approach to
state-funded financial
assistance for victims of crime is the use of judicial officers. Victoria is one
of the few Australian jurisdictions
that uses judicial decision
14.6 For some victims, the hearing of an application by a judicial officer
provides an acknowledgment from the justice system that
there has been a crime
and that they

have suffered harm as a consequence.
considers that the structure enables
‘victims of crime [to] gain acknowledgment of their experiences by a
judicial officer in the criminal justice system, but in
the more flexible,
informal and intimate manner afforded by an administrative
14.7 For some victims, the importance of being heard and validated
outweighs any monetary award. The experience of VOCAT’s
Koori List is that
‘most victims want to hear someone say, on behalf of the State of
Victoria, that we are sorry that this
happened to
14.8 Some victims’ experience of VOCAT hearings is positive, describing
Tribunal members as caring, patient and understanding.
Where an offender had not been prosecuted, victims tended to feel
acknowledged and validated by the VOCAT hearing.
During preliminary consultations, the Commission was told about the
powerful nature of such judicial acknowledgment, particularly
in sexual offence
matters where successful prosecution is rare.
14.9 However, research by the Victims Support Agency has found that this is
not the experience of all victims of crime and that victims’
experience of
VOCAT varies:
Comments about the VOCAT hearing were mixed. While many participants made
positive comments about Tribunal Members and felt acknowledged
and validated by
the hearing, particularly where no offender was prosecuted, some participants
felt distressed by having to recount
details of the crime they experienced. One
participant was
distressed by the Tribunal member’s comments. One felt the court did
not adequately cater to the needs of disabled people and
another felt there was
a lack of support during and after the hearing.
14.10 Some victims can be distressed by having to recount details of the
crime during VOCAT
Having the matter heard by a tribunal member, who listens to a victim’s
story and acknowledges their experience, can be a therapeutic
experience for
some applications. However, attending a hearing and giving evidence about the
criminal act may further distress others.
14.11 During the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence (the
Royal Commission), the witness statement of Rebecca Smith
highlighted how
experiences of the VOCAT process can vary.
14.12 Ms Smith had been through the VOCAT process as a victim of
‘stranger violence’—where she found the experience
validating—as well as experiencing VOCAT for family violence matters.
Although Ms Smith described the rape as horrible, she
also described it as
‘one night of my life’. She compared this to the way family violence
had affected her life for years.
Ms Smith found the award of $1000 for the
family violence compared to one of
$10,000 for the rape to be an inadequate representation of the significant
impacts family violence had had on her life.
A trauma-informed process?
14.13 During preliminary consultations, the Commission was advised that one
of the reasons the VOCAT process can be re-traumatising
for victims is because
it is not a trauma-informed process.

14.14 Trauma-informed practice involves modifying aspects of service
provision to ensure a basic understanding of how trauma affects
the life of an
individual seeking a service.
A trauma-based approach accepts victims of crime as being harmed as a result
of the crime.
One of its benefits is that it avoids
re-traumatisation, as the focus is on ensuring the person’s physical,
psychological and
emotional safety.
14.15 Significantly, approaches that are not trauma-informed often mirror the
power and control experienced in abusive
relationships.
14.16 The Law Institute of Victoria has considered the importance of
trauma-informed legal practice, including for the judiciary and
Family Violence Rolling
Action Plan 2017–2020
recognises the need for the Magistrates’
Court to move towards
a more trauma-informed approach to family violence by ‘embedding a
specialist, trauma- informed response across our justice
system through the
expansion of the Specialist Family Violence Court
14.17 However, during preliminary consultations the Commission was advised
that the legal framework underpinning VOCAT necessitates
legal processes that
are not trauma- informed, such as perpetrator notification. These processes can
be re-traumatising, especially
for victims of family violence, including child

a victim’s behaviour or past conduct, including unrelated criminal

and irrelevant lines of questioning, including questions about what special
financial assistance funds might be spent
on, or why the victim had not left an

• perpetrator notification
provisions.
14.19 During preliminary consultations the Commission heard that some
stakeholders ‘shield’
their clients from the non-therapeutic aspects of VOCAT, such as
and section
54 queries which can re-traumatise victims.
Broader recognition of family violence
14.20 In Part Two, this paper discussed some problematic sections of the Act
that do not expressly acknowledge family violence or
allow adequate
consideration of the dynamics and characteristics of family violence in making
awards. However, more broadly, the
Act is silent on the issue of family
14.21 At the time of the introduction of the Act, in 1996, there was little
community acknowledgment of family violence or its harms.
Improved justice
responses did not commence until the early 2000s. There are now four Australian
family violence under their equivalent
legislation.
14.22 The Act’s failure to recognise family violence—or to
conceive of family violence itself as an ‘act of
violence’—remains
one of the fundamental challenges of ensuring the
Act appropriately responds to harms caused by family violence. As noted earlier,

Act conceives of crime as an ‘isolated random act of a deviant

over a long period of time and within an intimate setting. As Victoria Legal Aid
submitted to
the Royal Commission, the Act is better suited to
‘one-off’ acts of violence where the victim and perpetrator are not
known to each other.
14.23 This omission is why many stakeholders during preliminary consultations
referred to the Act as only conceptualising ‘stranger
with some likening the Act to a ‘bar room brawl’ model of victim
financial assistance. Other stakeholders
felt that the Act’s barriers for
family violence victims were so significant that it raised questions about the
the Act and whether it could actually ever apply to family violence
Consistency and transparency in practice and awards
14.24 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that the
inconsistency of VOCAT decisions, and the variability in the
acknowledgment and
validation of victims, significantly shape family violence victims’
experiences. This variability also affects
the extent to which the VOCAT process
may be recommended by support agencies working with victims
of family violence as a positive experience. There is a limit to how much a
victim can be assured of a ‘validating’ VOCAT
experience.
14.25 The Commission also heard that one of the barriers often encountered by
those supporting victims of family violence through
the VOCAT process was the
extent to which the process could be explained or predicted. In particular, the
Commission heard there
was variability in:
• the length of the process
• what will be requested by VOCAT
• what questions the victim will be asked
• whether the perpetrator will be notified
• the quantum of awards.
14.26 These issues are not new. Variability in the processes and decision
making of VOCAT has also been raised in previous
14.27 During preliminary consultations the Commission heard that this
variability is compounded by a lack of transparency in the VOCAT
process itself.
It is difficult to know, for example, whether the award offered during the
section 33 process is consistent with
that offered
in similar cases. Some stakeholders also told the Commission that the quantum
of awards made ‘on the papers’ seemed to
be lower than if a hearing
was held, and that determinations made ‘on the papers’, as opposed
to those made at hearing,
lacked transparency.
14.28 As with the issues of variability in process and decision making,
concerns about transparency in process are not new. In a submission
then-Victorian Department of Justice’s 2010 review of victim compensation,
the Federation of Community Legal Centres
stated that there was a need for more
transparency and equity in the VOCAT process.
The rights of perpetrators
14.29 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that some
stakeholders felt
that the Act operates to place the rights of the alleged offender before the
rights of the victim. This contrasts with the stated
purpose of the Act, which
is ‘to provide assistance to victims of

Victims of Crime Assistance Act
14.30 This issue was raised particularly in the context of the provisions for
notifying perpetrators.
Some stakeholders felt that these provisions are counter-productive and
contradict the purpose of the Act. They considered the provisions
inconsistent with a victim- centred approach that should be the foundation of
the VOCAT process. Furthermore, some stakeholders
also noted that in practice,
where perpetrators are notified, it is rare for them to then engage with the
VOCAT process by attending
hearings or providing submissions.
14.31 In this context, some stakeholders felt that the procedural fairness
intent of such provisions is outweighed by their negative
impacts on victims of
crime, particularly victims of family violence, and that this works against the
purpose and objectives of the
14.32 However, other stakeholders considered that it was important in the
interests of procedural fairness that perpetrators be notified
if an application
is made containing serious allegations against them, particularly where criminal
charges have not been laid or
a prosecution does not proceed.
Discussion and options for reform
Towards trauma-informed practice?
14.33 For some victims of crime, the potential for a judicial officer to hear
their matter in a court-like environment can be a validating
experience. Some
victims might find therapeutic benefit in having their story heard and their
experiences acknowledged.
14.34 However, the Commission heard during preliminary consultations that
this experience is not universal. Some stakeholders consulted
felt that this
variability in experience was because the framework underpinning the Act and the
operation of VOCAT is not trauma-
14.35 Ian Freckelton has reflected more broadly on the intrinsic lack of
understanding and training of decision-makers within financial
assistance and
compensation schemes, stating that ‘Decision makers who have never
encountered DSM-IV or standard works on trauma
and victim impact are put in the
position of having to deal with this sensitive
14.36 Some jurisdictions in Australia have an administrative scheme rather
than a court or tribunal-based scheme. This removes the
opportunity for
acknowledgment of a victim
by a judicial officer, but also reduces the potential for adverse outcomes
through a more legalistic process.
14.37 In the Northern Territory, the Crime Victims Services Unit manages
provision of financial assistance, which is allocated by
legally qualified
assessors. There is no requirement to attend a hearing. In the Australian
Capital Territory, an assessor from Victim
Support ACT will assess
applications.
As in the Northern Territory, there is
no requirement
to attend a hearing. In New South Wales, support coordinators from Victims
Services develop a care package, which might include financial
assistance and
recognition payments.
14.38 One proposal is to consider how trauma-informed practice could be
embedded within VOCAT and how this might improve experiences
for victims of
family violence. Such practice might include specialised training or specialist
staff—or a combination of both.
It might also involve broader structural
or procedural changes, such as a specialist family
violence list or specialist magistrates, as discussed in Chapter 11. These
strategies could be underpinned by a trauma-informed approach.

14.39 Consideration could also be given to how VOCAT can be integrated with
the broader service system, particularly given the models
in other jurisdictions
that combine compensation and victim support.
Recognising family violence
14.40 Family violence could also be recognised in the purpose and/or
objectives of the Act itself.
Such inclusion may improve family violence victims’ experiences of the
VOCAT process, as Tribunal members would be required
to have regard to the
circumstances of family violence. The provision could be general, acknowledging
the dynamics of family violence
and re-envisaging the Act as applicable in
circumstances involving family violence. However, any such recognition of family
would need to be carefully considered alongside any potential expansion
of eligibility criteria, as discussed in Chapter 6.
14.41 Such an amendment to the purpose and objectives of the Act would be a
significant departure from the Act’s original intent.
It was introduced at
a time when family violence was not recognised in the law as violence unless it
also involved a criminal offence
such as serious physical assault, sexual
assault or murder.
14.42 VOCAT has acknowledged that on previous occasions, when laws have been
reformed to address new offences, the Act has not necessarily
For example, in responses to new sexual
offending laws, VOCAT observed that ‘despite the harms caused by such
crimes, many of
the new offences would not satisfy the eligibility requirements
of the Act’.
14.43 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that the Act has
not been substantially amended since the 1990s, resulting
‘lagging’ behind both societal and other legal changes, such as the
increased recognition and detection of family
violence and the expanded
definition of family violence under the
Family Violence Protection
(Vic) and new sex offences.
14.44 The Magistrates’ Court of Victoria also recognises that the
Family Violence Protection
(Vic) challenges the way violent crime is conceptualised for
the purposes of the Act. However, in its submission to the Royal Commission,
Court cautioned against widening the Act to apply to cases where family violence
has occurred, but there is not necessarily an
‘act of violence’. The
Court was concerned that such an expansion of the definition would result in an
increase in the
number and complexity of applications being made to VOCAT,
resulting in unintended consequences, like more matters requiring hearings
perpetrator notification.
14.45 The Magistrates’ Court of Victoria instead favoured an approach
that enabled decision makers to take into account family
violence issues where
14.46 An approach of ‘broad recognition’, possibly incorporated
as a specific objective of the Act, may be consistent
with the approach posited
by the Magistrates’ Court. Incorporating a general acknowledgment of
family violence might better
guide decision makers to consider family violence
when applying provisions of the Act that have broad discretionary powers, such
as sections 52, 53 and 54.
Consistency and transparency in approach
14.47 During preliminary consultation, the Commission heard concerns from
some stakeholders about the level of discretion built into
the Act. Many
stakeholders spoke about inconsistencies in the practice, approach and the
quantum of awards being made by VOCAT members,
and considered that these
inconsistencies were tied to the level of discretion granted by the Act. Some
stakeholders felt that the
broad discretion in the Act

Victoria, Submission No 978 to Royal Commission into Family
Commission into Family Violence
(June 2015) 58.
could also be used inappropriately, for example, pursuing
‘irrelevant’ lines of questioning about a victim’s past
current actions or behaviour.
14.48 Some stakeholders suggested more guidance in the Act might help to
improve consistency in the Tribunal’s practice, even
if this resulted in
more prescriptive considerations, categories or award amounts. These
stakeholders considered such changes would
make it easier to guide victims
through the VOCAT process and to manage expectations, even if there was less
flexibility.
14.49 Consideration could therefore be given to the ways in which increased
consistency and transparency could be embedded within
the Act, particularly with
respect to family violence victims who face additional barriers in eligibility
and whose applications
are frequently complex.
Perpetrator and victim rights
14.50 Given the issues raised by stakeholders concerning notification of
perpetrators, further consideration of these provisions is
required to ensure
the Act appropriately balances the rights of victims of family violence and the
rights of perpetrators. The Commission
heard differences of opinion during the
preliminary consultations about whether removing the requirement to inform
perpetrators would
be contrary to the requirements of procedural fairness or
whether such amendments would make the Act more consistent with its purpose
objectives.
14.51 The Commission seeks the views of victims, persons affected,
professionals, stakeholders and the community on how perpetrator
rights should be appropriately balanced, having regard to the purpose of the
Act—to assist victims of crime. This
includes considering whether the
central purpose of the law is to help victims recover. Specific questions for
consideration are
set out below.
what extent is VOCAT a therapeutic process for victims of family violence,
including for child victims?
VOCAT, or aspects of it, is not therapeutic for family violence victims,
including child victims, what legislative or other changes
should be made so
that it is?
would a trauma-informed VOCAT process help improve family violence
victims’ experience of VOCAT, including for child victims?
57 Are there other approaches that should be considered to
improve the VOCAT
process or access to it for victims of family violence,
including child victims?
58 What factors currently impact on consistency in practice, procedure
and the making of awards to family violence victims, including
to child victims?
How should this variability best be addressed?
59 How might transparency in process and determination of
awards be improved?
do the rights of perpetrators—to be notified or to appear—fit with
the purpose of the Act, which is to provide assistance
to victims of crime?
What changes, if any, should be made to the Act to appropriately balance the
rights of perpetrators and the
rights of victims of family

objectives of the Act
Introduction
15.1 The purpose of the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
(the Act) is to provide assistance to victims of
15.2 Although not a matter expressly identified for the consideration of the
Victorian Law Reform Commission (the Commission) in the
terms of reference, the
Commission considers that a review of the provision of state-funded financial
assistance to victims
of family violence under the Act requires examination of whether the Act is
fulfilling its purpose and objectives as far as family
violence victims are
15.3 Accordingly, this chapter discusses how the Act assists victims of
family violence ‘to recover from the crime by paying
them financial
assistance for expenses incurred, or reasonably likely to be incurred as a
direct result of the crime’.
15.4 The chapter also discusses when and how the Act pays victims of family
violence ‘financial assistance ... as a symbolic
expression by the State
of the community’s sympathy and condolence for, and recognition of,
significant adverse effects experienced
or suffered by them as victims of
15.5 Finally, this chapter considers whether the Act allows victims of family
violence to have recourse to financial assistance where
compensation for their
injury cannot be obtained from the offender or other sources,
and the extent to which the Act complements other services provided by
the state to victims of crime.
15.6 In considering whether the Act’s purpose and objectives are
realised for family violence victims, the Commission revisits
some of the issues
outlined in Part Two of this paper.
It does this with the following question in mind: if issues encountered under
the Act disproportionately impact victims of family
violence, are the aims and
objectives of the Act as currently articulated, able to be realised for victims
of family violence?
15.7 Finally, this chapter then raises issues and poses questions for
stakeholder consideration.
Assisting victims to recover from crime
15.8 The first stated objective of the Act is to ‘assist victims of
crime to recover from the crime by paying them financial
assistance for expenses
incurred, or reasonably likely to be incurred, by them as a direct result of the
Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996
It is noted that awards of financial assistance under the Act are
not intended to reflect the level of compensation victims may
be entitled to at
common law: see ibid s 1(3).
Victims of Crime Assistance Act
15.9 Part One of this consultation paper discussed the practical and symbolic
benefits of
state-funded financial assistance under the Act for family violence victims.
These benefits reflect the purpose and objectives of
15.10 The importance of access to state-funded financial assistance for
victims of family violence has been widely recognised. The
Australian Law Reform
Commission and New South Wales Law Reform Commission identified victim
compensation and financial assistance
schemes as the principal method of
financial redress for most victims of family
15.11 Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s
Safety has noted that the unique circumstances of family
violence victims
increase their reliance on financial assistance
to assist with overcoming costs associated with escaping abuse such as
relocation, loss of employment or legal costs associated with
relationship.
Such financial disadvantage can occur
even when family violence is physical or psychological in nature and there are
no elements of
financial or economic abuse.
15.12 Economic and financial security is key to a family violence
victim’s recovery from crime.
However, Women’s Legal Service Victoria has stated that for the Act to
genuinely assist victims to recover from family violence,
extensive reform is
15.13 Some of the issues encountered by family violence victims relating to
specific aspects of the Act’s operation were discussed
in Part Two of this
paper. In considering the broader question of whether the Act assists family
violence victims to recover from
crime, some of these matters are re-examined in
this chapter.
Eligibility
15.14 Fundamentally, it may be difficult for the Act to assist family
violence victims to recover from crime when such victims are
so often ineligible
for awards of assistance. The issue of eligibility, including some options for
reform, was discussed at Chapter
15.15 The definition of an ‘act of violence’ is a key barrier
facing victims of family violence in accessing awards under
the Act. Indeed, it
is one of the fundamental barriers to the achievement of the Act’s key
objective, which is to assist victims
in their recovery from
The requirement for certain ‘criminal
acts’ limits access to the scheme to victims who have experienced physical
sexual violence, threat of injury or
15.16 The definition of an ‘act of violence’ under the Act is
also narrower than the definition of
‘family violence’ under the
Family Violence Protection Act
Victims of non- criminal forms of
family violence, such as economic abuse, emotional and psychological abuse,
property damage, intimidation
and harassment are therefore excluded from the
scheme established under the Act. Furthermore, due to the narrow definition of
‘act of violence’, children who experience family violence by
hearing, witnessing or otherwise being exposed to the effects
of it, are not
recognised as primary victims under the Act.
15.17 Even where a ‘criminal act’ constitutes an ‘act of
violence’ under the Act, victims of family violence
can confront
difficulties proving that an offence occurred,
that they have suffered ‘injury’ as a result.
During preliminary consultations the Commission heard that

proving an offence occurred is complicated by the fact that victims of
family violence may not report matters until long after an
injury has occurred,
and that they may encounter barriers to reporting or may be unable to produce
evidence of the injury.
15.18 Without a broader definition of violence, more like the definition of
family violence under the
Family Violence Protection Act 2008
may be difficult for the Act to meaningfully assist the majority of family
violence victims to recover from crime. This
is because the Act’s
applicability is limited.
Assistance available
15.19 As discussed in Chapter 7, even where eligibility issues are overcome
by victims of family violence, they can be disadvantaged
by the quantum
generally awarded in family violence matters.
15.20 The Act provides that a series of acts can be considered a single
criminal act if they
‘occurred over a period of time and were committed by the same person
or group of persons.’
This provision can
disproportionately reduce the awards received by victims of family
because ‘Domestic violence, almost by
definition, will involve repeated acts of abuse by the same
15.21 As the Magistrates’ Court and Children’s Court of Victoria
submitted to the Victorian Royal Commission into Family
Violence (the Royal
Commission), the ‘related criminal acts’ provision means ‘that
a victim of long-term, chronic
family violence (a series of related acts) is
placed on an equivalent footing to someone who has been injured in a one-off
for example in a brawl between
strangers’.
15.22 Similarly, the special financial assistance categories ‘[do] not
sufficiently take into account the cumulative harm of
individual acts of
violence as a result of experiencing persistent and protracted
This is because the relevant
categories are based on the severity of a single offence, rather than the
overall impact of a pattern
15.23 A family violence victim’s recovery is likely to be adversely
impacted by a process that does not recognise or account
for the different
impacts of persistent violence. Without recognition of the cumulative effect of
a pattern of abuse, the Act may
be limited in its ability to truly assist these
victims to recover.
15.24 Some child victims of family violence are also unable to access special
financial assistance because they are not recognised
as primary victims under
the Act. In addition, even where child victims are eligible for special
financial assistance, the categories
do not acknowledge the long-term and
far-reaching consequences of experiencing family violence as a child.
Time limits
15.25 An application for assistance must be made within two years after the
act of violence occurred.
The Royal Commission found
that the time limit is a barrier for victims of family
15.26 Family violence disclosures can, and often do, take time. Even where
disclosure occurs quickly, it can take time to regain enough
stability to even
consider making an application

Disclosure is even harder for child victims and therefore, the VOCAT time
limits are more challenging for such victims.
15.27 The fact that it may take a victim of family violence longer to lodge
an application for assistance with VOCAT means that the
time limit can have a
disproportionate impact on them compared to other victims of
Even though VOCAT may grant applications for
an extension of time, the existence of a time limit may be a disincentive for
some victims
of family violence.
15.28 Moreover, given that the time limit may operate to make victims of
family violence start the process before they are ready,
this alone can be
re-traumatising.
Perpetrator notification and appearance provisions
15.29 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that the fact
that a perpetrator is entitled to appear is a barrier,
as it is enough to cause
some victims of family violence to elect not to submit a VOCAT application.
15.30 These perpetrator notification provisions are particularly problematic.
In a family violence context, where recovery from crime
might involve preventing
court-like atmosphere is the opposite
of what they need. The potential benefits
of financial assistance may be outweighed by the negative effects of the
potential for
Mandatory refusal and victim character and behaviour
15.31 Requiring a victim to report family violence to police, as well as
provide assistance to police and prosecution, may also not
assist family
violence victims to recover from crime. Reporting family violence to police can
sometimes re-traumatise victims as
not always respond in a way that validates a victim’s experience.
Reporting to police may also cause a victim to fear reprisals
perpetrator. These issues can impact on the recovery of a victim.
15.32 During preliminary consultations, the Commission heard that such
requirements limit the ability of VOCAT to be victim-centred
in its approach and
limit the ability of victims to recover from the effects of crime. However, the
Commission also heard that in
considering the rights of victims, VOCAT also has
to consider the rights of perpetrators and ensure due process.
Timeliness of awards
15.33 Another key barrier to VOCAT being able to assist victims of family
violence to recover from crime is the legal process that
can result in delays in
financial assistance, in contrast to other support programs or financial
assistance which can be provided
immediately and holistically. In preliminary consultations, the Commission
heard that for family violence victims, VOCAT awards simply
take too long.
15.34 The delays victims of family violence experience in accessing financial
assistance under the
Act may therefore significantly affect their ability to begin recovering from
Variation process
15.35 Preliminary consultations indicated that the process of variation is
not always smooth or easy for victims of family violence.
This is particularly
the case where variations are sought for the purposes of awards relating to
additional counselling sessions.
Most variations in family violence matters
relate to additional counselling.

Victim Compensation and Domestic Violence: A National

Clearinghouse, 2010) 9.
15.36 It was suggested to the Commission that it might be more practical and
beneficial if practitioners were able to provide more
counselling sessions at
their discretion, rather than victims having to re-engage lawyers to ask for
15.37 During preliminary consultations the Commission was advised that these
variation processes, which are required under the Act,
‘victim-centred’. Instead, they rely on victims continually engaging
with a lawyer in order to ask for the help
they need. This limits the extent to
which the VOCAT framework may assist victims of family violence to recover from
Symbolic payments to ‘certain victims of crime’ as
recognition
15.38 The second stated objective of the Act is to ‘pay certain victims
of crime financial assistance (including special financial
assistance) as a
symbolic expression by the State of the community’s sympathy and
condolence for, and recognition of, significant
adverse effects experienced or
suffered by them as victims of crime’.
15.39 This part of the consultation paper examines two aspects of this
objective. First, whether family violence victims are—or
be—’certain victims’ under the Act and secondly, whether the
financial assistance available is an appropriate
recognition of the significant
adverse effects experienced of suffered by victims of family violence.
Are family violence victims ‘certain victims’ under the
15.40 As outlined in Chapter 7, special financial assistance has four
categories based on the severity of the act of violence. Each
category has a
minimum and maximum award amount which is prescribed in section 8A(5) of the
Category A:
offences involving sexual penetration and attempted murder. The maximum amount
is $10,000 and the minimum is $4667.
Category B:
offences involving attempted sexual penetration, an indecent act, an indecent
assault, armed robbery, aggravated burglary
and deprivation of liberty for the
purpose of sexual penetration or demanding a ransom. The maximum amount
$3250 and the minimum is $1300.
Category C:
offences involving an attempt to commit any of the offences in Category B, a
death threat, conduct endangering life, the
infliction of serious injury and
robbery. The maximum amount is $1300 and the minimum is $650.
Category D:
offences involving an attempt to commit any of the offences in Category C, a
threat of injury, assault, attempted assault,
deprivation of liberty (other than
for sexual penetration or ransom) and any other act of
The maximum amount is $650 and the minimum
15.41 During preliminary consultations the Commission heard
that victims of family violence are sometimes determined to be ‘certain
victims’ under the Act. However, they frequently
fall into the lower special financial assistance categories of C and D, even
after long periods of violence and abuse. The minimum
amount in these
circumstances is $130. The maximum amount is
15.42 In this context, a key issue raised in the Royal Commission was that

Is the financial assistance available an appropriate recognition of family
15.44 Noting it is beyond the terms of reference to consider the total
financial assistance currently available, the Commission’s
preliminary
research and consultations indicate that payments of special financial
assistance in family violence matters are not
currently recognised by many
stakeholders as an appropriate symbolic expression by the state of the
community’s sympathy, condolence
for, and recognition of, the significant
adverse effects of family violence.
15.45 During preliminary consultations, some stakeholders commented on the
significant government investment in family violence since
the Royal Commission.
Stakeholders
felt that this demonstrates a broader cultural shift and community
acknowledgment of the harms of family violence to both individuals
community. However, these stakeholders also felt that the current VOCAT awards
are too small to adequately reflect community
expectations.
15.46 Moreover, the Commission was advised that because payments are so low
in family violence matters, some support workers will
advise clients that the
process is not worth it. For some victims, the fact that they are effectively
‘locked out’ of
higher categories of award might be enough of a
disincentive to put them off the application process. These perceptions impact
VOCAT ‘take up’ rate in family violence matters.
15.47 Given the limitations on special financial assistance encountered by
victims of family violence, it is not clear that the current
categories of award
are providing the level of acknowledgment and recognition that might be
expected. In addition, it is suggested
that the provision of financial
assistance is not timely or substantial enough to enable a victim to escape the
cycle of violence.
15.48 Therefore, preliminary consultations and research conducted by the
Commission indicate this objective of the Act is not being
realised for victims
of family violence.

15.51 Issues encountered by the Commission during preliminary consultations
and through preliminary research raise questions regarding
the appropriateness
of the legislative provisions themselves, and the extent to which they
acknowledge the nature and dynamics of
family violence. In particular, questions
arise regarding the ability of the service system and legal practitioners to
support victims through the VOCAT process, as well as perceived
barriers to the scheme and lack of knowledge of assistance available.
Assumption that other compensation is available
15.52 The Act is intended to provide assistance for victims of crime where
compensation for their injury cannot be obtained from the
offender or other
In support of this objective, the Act
therefore expressly provides that where compensation is also obtained from the
perpetrator,
the person must refund the award.
However, where compensation is obtained from another source, the Tribunal
has a discretion whether or not to require refund of the
15.53 Underlying this objective is the notion that ‘the offender or
other state-funded compensation schemes are primarily responsible
compensation of victims’.
Indeed, this notion
is reflected in the Second Reading Speech to the Act as first enacted, which
notes ‘wherever practicable
convicted offenders [should] make good the
harms caused by their crimes by paying compensation for pain and suffering to
as assessed by the courts’.
15.54 In practice, and as noted earlier, VOCAT has often been the only source
of compensation for family violence victims, rather
than being a
‘supplement’ to other forms of compensation,
although the availability of flexible support packages means it may no
longer be the only avenue of financial assistance. Yet the
Act presumes
that compensation is available from the offender or other sources. This is
particularly problematic for victims of family violence
for whom it is often
impractical or unsafe to pursue other avenues of compensation.
Complementing other government services
15.55 As expressly noted in the Act, the intention of the Act is to
‘complement other services provided by government to victims
15.56 However, the extent to which the Act and VOCAT complement other
government services raises questions about the extent to which
victims of family
violence are required to seek information, support and assistance from different
services and agencies which are
not linked or able to share information
effectively.
15.57 Government services for victims of crime and, more specifically, family
violence victims, aim to be ‘victim-centred’.
However, research indicates that VOCAT is not easy to access or navigate
for victims of family violence. Women’s Legal Service
Victoria has found
that victims of family violence must go to numerous different places to get

financial issues arising from family violence. Services are also often

time and few
resources. Victims may have to retell their stories over and
15.58 This issue was raised during the Royal Commission and addressed by its
Recommendation
37, that support and safety hubs be established.
Support and safety hubs envisage dealing with a single ‘hub’
to access a range of information and support, rather than
having to seek
information and support via multiple avenues. Linkages between victims, victim
and family violence support services
and the justice system, including VOCAT,
are also expected to improve once support and safety hubs are
established.
15.59 Preliminary consultation and research conducted by the Commission also
indicated some anomalies in the financial assistance
available to victims of
family violence if a victim accesses different support services or financial
assistance mechanisms.
15.60 For example, a victim of family violence may approach a specialist
family violence service wishing to urgently relocate after
leaving an abusive
relationship. She may be urgently assessed and a case management plan developed
by a specialist family violence
worker. This worker may apply for a family
violence flexible support package for bond and rent for a new rental property,
whitegoods and installing a security system. Funding of a few
thousand dollars may be provided within a number of weeks.
15.61 In contrast, a victim in the same circumstances might approach a
solicitor for assistance to lodge a VOCAT application. She
might then be told
that as she has not made a report to police, she is unlikely to be eligible
under the Act. She might also be advised
that even if she has reported to
police, the process will take time and that she may be unlikely to receive
assistance in enough
time to use the money for urgent relocation costs.
Discussion and options for reform
Maximising recovery
15.62 Promoting ‘recovery’ is a common theme across other
financial assistance and compensation schemes in Australian
15.63 Preliminary consultations and research conducted by the Commission
indicated that access to VOCAT is challenging for many victims
violence. This limits the extent
to which the Act can provide assistance to victims of family violence as
‘victims of crime’.
15.64 When the Act was introduced, the Second Reading Speech articulated a
broad intent to develop a model more responsive to the
needs of victims in order
to ‘maximise
the potential for a victim’s recovery from the psychological and
physical effects of a violent offence’.
Second Reading Speech also described the Act as establishing ‘an
integrated model of assistance [for] victims of

15.65 Based on the research and preliminary consultation undertaken by the
Commission, and the previous relevant inquiries referred
to, there appears to be
a range of barriers limiting VOCAT as an appropriate avenue for financial
assistance for many family violence

15.66 During preliminary consultations, the Commission was told that the
legislative framework must empower victims of family violence
and must send a
message that family violence will not be tolerated. The Commission was told that
family violence victims need to
be at the centre of the process, and that the
Act needs to mirror government and community expectations with respect to family
15.67 The Commission also heard that VOCAT needs to operate more effectively
and efficiently as part of the broader victim and family
violence service
system. Some felt that VOCAT’s greatest potential benefit for victims of
family violence was when it can be
used as a ‘re- establishment
fund’—that is, to provide financial assistance that will help a
victim recover from
crime by helping them re-establish their life.
15.68 Stakeholder input during preliminary consultations suggests that, in
order to be a state- funded financial assistance scheme
that maximises victim
recovery in the context of family violence, the Act requires:
• recognition of a broader definition of family violence beyond the
notion of a single
‘act of violence’ and potentially incorporating non-violent forms
• recognition of the cumulative harm of persistent and protracted
family violence
acknowledgment
of the difficulties faced by family violence victims in reporting to police,
assisting prosecution and applying for
assistance, without applying prescriptive
time frames
• prioritisation of a victim’s safety and
wellbeing, and a trauma-informed approach
more timely
access to financial assistance at the point of crisis and better integration
with existing supports
more flexibility
and adaptability as circumstances change, without further burdening victims with
having to continue to access lawyers
in order to obtain support such as
counselling.
15.69 The Commission seeks the views of victims,
persons affected, professionals, stakeholders and the community on how the Act
maximise victim recovery in the context of family violence and what
changes would need to be made to the Act. Specific questions
are set out
purpose of the Act is to ‘provide assistance to victims of crime’.
Is this purpose realised for victims of family
violence, including child
victims? If not, why not?
the purpose of the Act is not being realised for victims of family violence,
including for child victims, how should this be done?
the purpose and objectives of the Act be amended to expressly recognise family
violence? If yes, how should this be done?
Act states that ‘certain victims of crime’ should be awarded
financial assistance as a symbolic expression by the
state. Are family violence
victims, including child victims, adequately covered by the current special
financial assistance provisions?
If not, how should this be done?
Act aims to complement other services provided by government to victims of
crime. Is this achieved for family violence victims?
If not, how should this be
66 In assessing any proposals for change, what criteria and
considerations should the Commission have regard to? How should the
of family violence victims, including child victims, be taken into

not enough. You should make a formal report, including a sworn
statement (if
requested), so the police can fully investigate the matter. You should give the
Tribunal full details of the relevant
police officer’s station, rank and
registration number. If you do not provide this information, it may lead to
delays in processing
your application.
If you did not report the incident to police, delayed in reporting the
incident or you have not assisted the police with an arrest
investigation, you may not be entitled to assistance. You will need to
demonstrate that special circumstances prevented
you from doing so. You must

crime and the reason you
did not report the matter to the police or provide them
with reasonable assistance in their investigation. There is a form for
declarations on page 7 of the application form for you to outline this
information. You must sign the

request a report from your doctor, dentist or hospital without the
Tribunal’s authorisation because the Tribunal
may not compensate you for
the cost of obtaining that report. If you wish to obtain a medical or dental
report, you should ask the
Tribunal first.
If you attended
a public hospital, the Tribunal will obtain the hospital records. The
information the Tribunal obtains from

statements about medical and dental treatment. This means the cost of obtaining

counselling, you should attach a report from

Section 6. DETERMINATION OF YOUR APPLICATION
You can elect to appear before a Tribunal Member at a hearing or ask the
Tribunal to decide your application in your absence.

has affected you. Hearings usually take about half an
hour, but they may take
longer. They are usually open to the public but you can ask the Tribunal to
exclude members of the public.
You can also ask the Tribunal for an order
restricting publication of the hearing. A Tribunal hearing is less formal than
court hearing. You may come alone or bring a friend or family member
for support.
Application decided in your absence
The Tribunal decides many applications in the absence of the victim with
consent. The Tribunal member reads all the documents that
you and/or your lawyer
have provided. If the Tribunal member needs further information they will ask
for it. In some cases, the
information provided is not enough and the Tribunal
member will ask you to attend a hearing so it can obtain additional
information.
Interpreters

arrange for the interpreter to attend.

▪ the offender, through a civil claim for compensation
▪ Victoria Police, under the Police Assistance Act, if you were
injured assisting the police
▪ insurance, including life and income insurance
▪ superannuation benefits
If you are entitled to receive assistance from another source, the Tribunal
may not be able to assist you. If you obtain compensation
from another source,
for instance, settlement of a common law claim, after the Tribunal has made an
award of assistance, the Tribunal
may request you to repay its award. This is
to prevent people being compensated more than once for the same incident.

Tribunal and indicate how much you have received.
