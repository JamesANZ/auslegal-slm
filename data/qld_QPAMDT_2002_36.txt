REASON FOR DECISION:
1. This is a claim by Greg Stenzel and Debbie Stenzel (“the
Stenzels”) on the claim fund established under the
Property Agents and
Motor Dealers Act 2000
(“the Act”).
2. The claim relates
to the sale by consignment by the First Respondent of the Applicants’
motor vehicle, a Ford Falcon Futura,
Registration Number 541-DIT.
The Tribunal is satisfied on the basis of
the evidence that the First Respondent misapplied the funds owing to the
Stenzels for the
sale of the vehicle to its own purposes.
The Tribunal is satisfied that the First
Respondent was a “relevant person” under Section 469 of the
The Tribunal finds that the
misapplication of the money that should have been paid to the Stenzels resulted
in the Stenzels suffering
a financial loss and that the misapplication brings
the claim within Section 470 of the Act.
The Tribunal is satisfied on the basis of
the evidence, supplied by the Stenzels, that the amount of their loss is
$11,534.24.
On the basis of the Tribunal’s
finding, the Tribunal orders that the Chief Executive of the Department of
Tourism, Racing and
Fair Trading pay the Stenzels the sum of
$11,534.24.
The Tribunal makes no order as to the
date of payment due to the requirement of Section 489 of the Act that the Chief

The Tribunal makes no order against the
Second Respondent, Richard Ian Elliott or the Third Respondent, John Frederick
David Lewin.
The Tribunal is satisfied that Richard
Ian Elliott is a “relevant person”, being the holder of a licence.
However, the
Tribunal is not satisfied that John Frederick David Lewin is a
“relevant person” as defined in Section 469 of the Act.
There is no evidence before the Tribunal
that he was a licensee as defined, or was an employee or agent of Saxview Pty
Ltd, or was
a person carrying on business with Saxview Pty Ltd or was a person
having charge or control, or apparent charge or control, of Saxview’s
registered office or business.
Both persons were directors of Saxview
Pty Ltd and were made respondents to the Stenzels’ claim under Section 475
of the Act.
There is no evidence before the
Tribunal, however, of any involvement by either of them in the dealings with the
Stenzels that led
to this claim or of any contravention by them of Section
The Tribunal notes that the Act contains
no provision similar to Section 125 of the repealed

corporation.
