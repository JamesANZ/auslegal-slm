Community.’[13]
Aboriginality of Victim
Factors arising from Offender’s Aboriginal Background Considered
by the Court
alcohol[20] ‘My Brumby has been affected by an environment in which the
abuse of alcohol is common’;[20]
Substance abuse
in the Communities of the APY Lands;[19]
socio-economic factors’ on the APY Lands such as ‘poverty, hunger,
illness, lack of education, unemployment,
boredom, and general feelings of
hopelessness’;[19]
He has some
basic schooling but is unable to read or write;[9]

Cultural and
family commitments;[21]
Responsible for
the maintenance of Aboriginal traditions and culture;[8]
cultural dislocation;[24]
... integrate him into the Community’’[24] and
‘culturally appropriate counselling.’[24]
The Court fixed a non-parole period of 12 months pursuant to s 32(3) of the
Sentencing Act 1988
(SA), to date from 3 September 2013.[25]
The present application concerns an application by the
offender, Mr Brumby, to fix a non-parole period with respect to a sentence
imposed on him for rape, committed at Coober Pedy in April in 2006.[1] The rape
was committed while the offender was ‘heavily
intoxicated.’[2] The
offence appears to have been motivated by ‘a jaundiced sense of domestic
revenge’ and alcohol
appears to have been the catalyst.[2]
September 2009 a judge in the District Court of South Australia sentenced Mr
Brumby to eight years imprisonment with a non-parole
period of five years
effective from 23 June 2008 [2]. On 24 June 2013, the offender was released on
parole by order of the Parole
On 25 February 2014 the offender
was convicted in the Magistrates Court of South Australia for the offence of
driving without a licence.
This offence had occurred on 10 August 2013,
‘just over two months after his release.’[3] The offender was
without further penalty. It appeared that this was because of
‘time spent in custody.’[3]
On 21 August 2013 an
intervention order was made with respect to the offender’s partner.[4] The
offender breached this order
on 30 August 2013 by throwing rocks at his partner,
constituting a serious assault.[4] He was convicted in the Magistrates Court
South Australia on 15 November 2013. Given that the offender had spent two and a
half months in custody, he was convicted but
discharged without further
penalty.[4]
On 3 September 2013 a Parole Board warrant was issued for his
arrest. On 17 December 2013 his parole was cancelled by the Parole
effective from 3 September 2013.
As at 30 May 2014, the offender remains
liable to serve a balance sentence of two years, nine months, and 23 days.[5]
His sentence
therefore expires on 22 June 2016.[5]
On 14 February 2014,
the offender applied to the District Court of South Australia to fix a
non-parole period with respect to this
outstanding sentence, pursuant to s 32(3)
Sentencing Act 1988
(SA).[6] In a report submitted by the Parole
Board at the request of the Court (s 32(9)
Sentencing Act
), the Parole
Board indicated it was not opposed to fixing a non-parole period.[7] The
Director of Public Prosecutions opposed the
application due to the
offender’s ‘behaviour’ during the period of release on parole,
and for the protection of
the community, specifically his
partner.[7]
Offender’s circumstances
The offender is
23 years of age.[8] He resided on the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara
Lands (APY Lands), centred around the
community of Indulkana.[3] He is of
‘Aboriginal descent’ and grew up in ‘a traditional
[I]ndigenous way on the
APY homelands.’[8] He belongs to a traditional
[I]ndigenous community [13]. He spends time in the bush learning survival and
life skills and is an initiate.[8] The offender will increasingly become
responsible to his Community, family, and Elders for the
maintenance of
Aboriginal traditions and culture.[8] His father and older relatives are
‘respected Elders of the Community.’[8]
He is the father of a
child.[8] He has had ‘some basic schooling’ but is unable to read or
write.[9] He was ‘apparently
a good footballer playing for
Indulkana.’[9]
As at 30 May 2014, there is accommodation and some
work in a community garden and cattle mustering available to him on the
The offender proposes to return to the Community to attend to
traditional responsibilities and obligations, and care for his family,
proposal encouraged by the wider Elder group.[9]
The psychiatric report
identified that imprisonment of a person with a background such as of the
offender ‘inevitably brings
forward feelings of social and temporal
dislocation from family and country, which consequently prones him to
depression.’[10]
The offender was convicted of an assault in December 2004.[8] He was also
imprisoned for four months for an aggravated assault committed
in December 2016
(when another domestic violence restraining order was in place).[8]
Aboriginal Customary Law issues raised
Not applicable
Aboriginal Cultural Practice or kinship issues raised
Tilmouth J took notice of a Pre-Sentence Report that canvassed the views of a
number of Elders from the Indulkana and nearby Communities
that referred to the
importance of cultural and family commitments,[21] and the cultural imperatives
of attending to cultural obligations,
the obtaining of culturally appropriate
counselling, and the restoration of the family unit.[22]
Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and / or indicators of disadvantage
Considering that the
offender ‘belongs to a traditional [I]ndigenous Community,’ Tilmouth
J quoted as ‘the starting
point’ the ‘oft approved’
statement of Brennan J in
Neal v The Queen
[1982] HCA 55
, which can be
paraphrased as the principle that the same sentencing principles are to be
applied in every case, despite the identity
of the offender of membership of a
particular group, though courts are bound to consider all material facts.[13]
Tilmouth J referred to the ‘historic structural inequality’
of Aboriginal people, ‘systemic socio-economic marginalisatim,’
‘post-colonial dispossession, cultural fragmentation and
disempowerment’ as noted in
[2003] SASC 85
[2010] SASC 237.[14]
Tilmouth J observed the statement of Gray J in
factors of social and economic disadvantage ... cultural factors or the
unique history and treatment of a particular ethnic group
...may be relevant to
the court’s assessment of the gravity of the offending and the
defendant’s blameworthiness
However, his Honour then noted the statement in
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
that it was ‘antithetical to individualised justice’
to take judicial notice of the systemic background of deprivation
and social and
economic disadvantage of Aboriginal offenders, although this says ‘nothing
His Honour considered
that this principle was further explained in
Munda v Western Australia
[2013] HCA 38
where the High Court deemed it contrary to the principle in
to ‘accept that Aboriginal offending is to be viewed
systemically as less serious than offending by persons of other
ethnicities.’[15]
The Court also referred to the statement in
that general deterrence has:
little rational claim upon the sentencing discretion ... where prolonged and
widespread social disadvantage has produced communities
so demoralised or
alienated that it is unreasonable to expect the conduct of individuals within
those communities to be controlled
by rational of the consequences of
misconduct.[15]
The Court acknowledged counter-ruling considerations such
as vindicating the dignity of the victims of violence, expressing the
Community’s
disapproval of offending, to protect vulnerable persons
against repeated violence, and to discourage victims from resorting to
self-help.[16]
Application of Fernando principles
J then cited three propositions on the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders
‘distilled’ by Wood J in
R v Fernando
(1992) 76 A Crim R 58
to the effect that:
significant degree, alcohol abuse and violence go hand in hand within Aboriginal
communities. It is proper for the court to recognise
this and that a
‘cure’ for such problems requires more subtle remedies than
imprisonment.[17]
abuse of alcohol by the offender reflects the socio-economic circumstances and
environment in which they have grown up, that
can and should be taken into
account as a mitigating factor.[17] This involves the realistic recognition by
the court of the endemic
presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and
the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self image,
absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have
placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort
to alcohol and
compounding its worst effects.[17]
an Aboriginal offender who is from a deprived background, disadvantaged by
reason of social or economic factors, or who has little
experience of
‘European ways’, a lengthy term of imprisonment may be particularly,
even unduly, harsh.[17]
Tilmouth J noted that
these principles to conform with the statement of
sentencing principle by Brennan J in
and were also quoted with
approval in
In applying all these principles, Tilmouth J noted, by reference to
, that substance abuse was a ‘long standing problem’ in
the Communities of the APY Lands that ‘constantly threatens’
‘peace, order and security of communities, cultural and family structures,
education, health and community development.’[19]
Tilmouth J noted that
identified that there were pervading
‘socio-economic factors such as poverty, hunger, illness, lack of
education, unemployment,
boredom, and general feelings of hopelessness’ on
the APY Lands.[19] He considered these factors, like those identified in
, to amount to circumstances of ‘profound depravation’
that do not diminish over time and ought to be given full weight
in determining
the appropriate sentence in every case.[19]
Cultural Considerations
Tilmouth J took notice of a Pre-Sentence Report that canvassed the views of a
number of Elders from the Indulkana and nearby Communities
and observed its
conclusion that:
Anangu men should be given every opportunity to return to their Country so as
to be involved in all cultural and family commitments,
and every effort made to
provide them with achievable goals and manageable conditions to assist them to
successfully complete any
period of release. All the people spoken to for the
purpose of this report posed no objection to the release of Irban Brumby to the
APY lands.[21]
Tilmouth J also noted that the Pre-Sentence Report confirmed the
‘cultural imperatives of attending to cultural obligations,
the obtaining
of culturally appropriate counselling and to restore the family
His Honour also recognised ‘some debate as to whether Mr Brumby should
return immediately to Indulkana where his partner and
child reside, but where
there might be easier access to alcohol than on the other APY
Communities.’[23] Nevertheless, his Honour
determined that this in itself
afforded no reason to decline to fix a non-parole period.[23]
Relevant passage(s):
The same sentencing principles are to be applied ... in every case,
irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership
ethnic or other group. But in imposing sentences courts are bound to take into
account, in accordance with those principles,
all material facts including those
facts which exist only by reason of the offender’s membership of an ethnic
or other group
... however, the weight to be attributed to the factors material
in a particular case, whether of aggravation or mitigation, is ordinarily
matter for the court exercising the sentencing discretion of first instance or
for the Court of Criminal Appeal.[13]
It is well documented that substance abuse of one kind or another is a long
standing problem in the Communities of the APY Lands and
that it constantly
threatens ‘the peace, order and security of communities, cultural and
family structures, education, health
and community development’:
. There remains on the APY Lands pervading ‘socio-economic
factors such as poverty, hunger, illness, lack of education, unemployment,
boredom, and general feelings of hopelessness’:
are the very type of circumstances countenanced by the High Court in
as amounting to ‘profound depravation [which] do not
diminish over time and ... are to be given full weight in the determination
the appropriate sentence in every case.’[19]
Nevertheless although the circumstances by which Mr Brumby has been affected
by an environment in which the abuse of alcohol is common
must be taken into
account, that consideration must be balanced against the seriousness of his
offending.[20]
Tilmouth J held that the offender’s continued incarceration, having
been returned to custody for nine months, had served ‘only
to worsen the
evident social and cultural dislocation he experiences.’[24] He was
satisfied that there were ‘intricate
plans to insulate him from negative
influences and temptations and to gradually integrate him into the Community and
counsel him
in the process on the path to rehabilitation.’[24] In light of
this, he considered the offender would be ‘unlikely’
to reoffend,
amenable and likely to respond to supervision, would have the opportunity to be
given culturally sensitive counselling
and that protection of the Community
would be served.[24]
On this basis, Tilmouth J fixed a non-parole period of 12 months, pursuant to
section 32(3) of the
Sentencing Act 1988
