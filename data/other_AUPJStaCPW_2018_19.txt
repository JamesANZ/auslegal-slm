6. Defence High Performance Computing Centre
6.1 The Department of Defence (Defence) seeks approval from the Committee to
proceed with the proposed Defence High Performance Computing
Centre (DHPCC) in
Edinburgh, South Australia.
6.2 The proposed works will provide the Defence Science and Technology Group
(DST) and the Australian Defence Organisation with secure
capability for high
fidelity modelling and simulation it currently does not possess.
6.3 DST is the Australian Government’s lead agency responsible for
applying science and technology to safeguard Australia and
delivers support to
the Australian Defence Force on operations, sustainment and improvement to
current capability, and development
of new and emerging
capability.
6.4 An analysis by DST of the high performance computing capability found
that DST required:
... a secure computer centre with sufficient physical capacity to house future
specialised high performance computing infrastructure
and access to DST’s
classified research
estimated cost of the project is $68.8 million (excluding GST).
6.6 The project was referred to the Committee on 13 September 2018.
6.7 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the Project, design activities are
expected to be completed by late 2018, with construction
expected to commence
from early 2019 for completion in mid-2020.
Conduct of the
6.8 Following referral, the inquiry was publicised on the Committee’s
website and via media release.
6.9 The Committee received two submissions and one confidential submission. A
list of submissions can be found at Appendix A.
6.10 On 29 October 2018, the Committee received a site inspection by
presentation. On the same day, the Committee also conducted a
in-camera hearing. A transcript of the public hearing is available on the
Committee’s website.
Need for the works
6.11 In its submission, Defence outlined the significant role that DST Group
plays in Australia’s defence and national security:
DST Group contributes to Australia’s defence and national security through
its capacity to reduce and mitigate strategic and
operational risks, and to
create and maintain a capability
6.12 According
to its submission, in 2006 Defence identified a need for a secure, centralised
supercomputer capability in order for
DST to conduct advanced research,
development, modelling and experimentation. This will support DST’s
contribution to Australia’s
defence and national security by enhancing its
capacity to reduce and mitigate strategic and operational risks and to create
maintain a capability edge.
6.13 While the project received Departmental approval in 2010, it was
subsequently suspended until November 2015 due to funding constraints.
recommenced following the 2016 Defence White Paper and the Defence Integrated
Investment Plan. This recommencement led to an analysis
of high performance
computing capability needs, which recognised that DST required a secure computer
centre with sufficient physical
capacity to house future specialised high
performance computing infrastructure and access to DST’s classified
research networks.
6.14 As a result, this proposal was integrated into DST’s plans to
replace its existing secure computer centre facilities at
Edinburgh with new
facilities.
6.15 DST Group Edinburgh manages its own secure computer network with a role
to provide expert, impartial and innovative application
of science and
technology for the defence of Australia and its national
6.16 The DHPCC is intended to deliver a new fit for purpose facility at the
DST establishment in the Edinburgh Defence Precinct which
will consist of a
secure high performance computing centre, capable of a capacity expansion, a
visualisation capability and training
facilities.
6.17 DST Group Edinburgh is the largest Defence science and technology site
in Australia, providing research facilities for approximately
1200 personnel
with a total workforce of approximately
Scope of the works
6.18 The DHPCC project will consist of a facility that has two interdependent
▪ A high-reliability secure data-centre to house the supercomputer;
▪ Co-located visualisation facilities which encompass secure
visualisation and auditorium facilities as well as training rooms
and laboratory
facilities.
6.19 The project will include:
a. A new high security/high integrity high performance computing data centre
capability;
b. Secure visualisation and auditorium facilities;
c. Dedicated DST secure meeting, training and laboratory facilities; and
d. Increased new car parking capacity required to support the
facilities.
6.20 The high performance computing data centre capability will have 2.5MW of
computing capacity (load managed within site capacity
limitations) with the
spaces and building services infrastructure to enable capacity to be expanded to
5.0MW once it is available.
6.21 In the submission, Defence notes that the mechanical services systems in
the building have been designed to enable the 2.5 MW
system to be readily
expandable to 5.0 MW.
Cost of the works
6.22 The total estimated cost of this project is $68.8 million, excluding
GST. This includes management and design fees, construction
costs, information
and communication technology (provided by Chief Information Officer Group, but
excludes the high performance computing
and associated components to be provided
by the Information Communication Technology Project), furniture, fittings,
equipment, contingency
and a provision for risk and
escalation.
6.23 Defence provided further detail on project costings in its confidential
submission and during an in-camera hearing.
6.24 The Committee is satisfied that the costings for the project provided to
it have been adequately assessed by the proponent entity.
Local impacts
6.25 The Committee sought details from Defence on the decision to locate the
DHPCC at DST Edinburgh.
6.26 Defence confirmed that they had considered DST’s existing research
sites at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne and DST Edinburgh.
They noted that the
Fishermans Bend site had size constraints but also that the DHPCC should be
co-located where the larger datasets
were. Defence further noted for reasons of
people, interaction, capability and the need to store, digest and manage large
DST Edinburgh
was the more suitable site.
Committee comment
6.27 The Committee did not identify any issues of concern with the proposal
and is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of
need, scope and
6.28 Having regard to its role and responsibilities contained in the
Public Works Committee Act 1969
, the Committee is of the view that this
project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project
fit for purpose, having regard to the established need.
Recommendation 5
6.29 The Committee recommends that the House of Representatives resolve,
pursuant to
Section 18(7)
Public Works Committee Act 1969
is expedient to carry out the following proposed work: Defence High Performance
Computing Centre project.
6.30 Proponent entities must notify the Committee of any changes to the
project scope, time, cost, function or design. The Committee
also requires that
a post-implementation report be provided within three months of project
completion. A report template can be found
on the Committee’s website.
